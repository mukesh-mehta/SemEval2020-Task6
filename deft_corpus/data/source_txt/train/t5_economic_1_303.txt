5221.         High-income countries of the world—primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union, and Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $360 billion per year.       By contrast, the total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to the poor countries of the world is about $70 billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. 

5227. While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates—according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2008 to late 2009, the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% to 10%; it has since fallen back to 5.5% in spring 2015—the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time.         The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in other unprotected industries.       First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries. 

5230. One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States, it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers.         After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage.       Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. 

5233.         Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production.       Anti-dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production. 

5236.         If free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism!       While globalization—and economic activity of all kinds—can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized. 

5239.         The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this.       Profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. 

5242. The United Nations was unable to agree to this.         Instead, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade.       In 1995, the GATT was transformed into the WTO. 

5245.         For the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).       The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries, and a free trade agreement with Israel. 

5248. What is a function?         A function describes a relationship.       Sometimes the relationship is a definition. 

5251. The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables.         A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also.       Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. 

5254. The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs, because they show a relationship between two variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis. 

5257.         A pie graph (sometimes called a pie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts.       A circle represents a group as a whole. 

5260. This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility.         By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility—an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic—the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.What Is an Indifference Curve?       

5263. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high—so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book.         In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution—that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant—also changes, as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods.       

5266. Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an income effect.         The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out substitutes.       If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins. 

5269. The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at the same level of utility.         The slope of the budget constraint in a labor-leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate.       Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or “buying power.” The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income. 

5272.         The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram, determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced.       The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [link] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending. 

5275.         When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP—because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy.       Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which will only occur along the 45-degree line. 

5278. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures.         The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save.       It must always hold true that: 

5281.         Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income.       In [link] (b), the marginal propensity to import is 0.1. 

5284.         The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import function.       The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures—which do not vary with national income. 

5287. Conversely, [link] (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE0) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP.         The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap.       The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. 

5290. The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency.         One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another.       Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. 

5293. Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product.         The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller’s actual cost is called producer surplus.       In [link], producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus. 

5296. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one.         In [link] (a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make.A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers.       After the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X.
