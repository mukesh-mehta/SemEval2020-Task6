937.         Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary AdaptationAngiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower.       Both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations. 

940.         The process of animal development begins with the cleavage, or series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote ([link]).       Three cell divisions transform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure. 

946. Only a few animal groups display radial symmetry.         All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animalâ€™s lifestyle.Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a drinking glass or pie.       It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, or front or back. 

949. More complex animals (those with bilateral symmetry) develop three tissue layers: an inner layer (endoderm), an outer layer (ectoderm), and a middle layer (mesoderm).         Animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts.       

955. Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids.         Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms.       These two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first: mouth or anus. 

961. There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes.         In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage.       This means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined. 

964. The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes (including chordates and echinoderms) and two distinct clades of protostomes (including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans) ([link]ab).         Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group: exoskeletal molting (termed ecdysis).       Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features, each common to certain phyla within the clade. 

973. Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall.         Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum.       However, sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms, including variations in the size of the spongocoel, the number of osculi, and where the cells that filter food from the water are located.
