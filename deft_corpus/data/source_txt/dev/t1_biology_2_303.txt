951.         Triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates, and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue, although they do still have a gut cavity.       Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes, also known as flatworms. 
1068. The lepidosaurs include modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras.         The archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators, and the extinct pterosaurs (“winged lizard”) and dinosaurs (“terrible lizard”).       Clade Dinosauria includes birds, which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs.Art Connection 
1074.         Squamata (“scaly”) arose in the late Permian, and extant species include lizards and snakes.       Both are found on all continents except Antarctica. 
1101. This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees.         These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs, which are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, 3) stereoscopic vision, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance.       Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright. 
1110. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member.         The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees.       Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species—including Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus—and those non-ancestral groups that can be considered “cousins” of modern humans, such as Neanderthals. 
1113.         There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens.       As discussed earlier, H. erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago. 
1185. Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight.         Phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.
