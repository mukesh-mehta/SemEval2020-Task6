1820.         Earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in [link]b.       A pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. 
1829.         Birds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine (guano) instead of urea.       Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. 
1832. The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts.         A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen.       Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. 
1835. The immune system has specific cells, described in [link] and shown in [link], with receptors that recognize these PAMPs.         A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens.       Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). 
1844. A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens.         A basophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [link].       Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses. 
1889.         During sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents.       The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment. 
1901.         In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function.       The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones.
