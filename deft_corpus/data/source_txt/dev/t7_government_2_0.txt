5831. In this way, government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down, as we see in elitist theory.         Robert Dahl, author of Who Governs?, was one of the first to advance the pluralist theory, and argued that politicians seeking an “electoral payoff” are attentive to the concerns of politically active citizens and, through them, become acquainted with the needs of ordinary people.       They will attempt to give people what they want in exchange for their votes.Dahl, Who Governs? 91–93. 

5834. Groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done.         In 2014, in the case of McCullen v. Coakley, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law that created a buffer zone between protestors and clinic entrances.McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. __ (2014); Melissa Jeltsen, “The Reality of Abortion Clinics without Buffer Zones,” The Huffington Post, 13 July 2014. The federal government does not always side with those who oppose abortion, however.       Several states have attempted to pass laws requiring women to notify their husbands, and often obtain their consent, before having an abortion.

Although they may not realize it, becoming active in the community and engaging in a wide variety of community-based volunteer efforts are important forms of civic engagement and help government do its job.       The demands on government are great, and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary. 

5858. However, their hopes were not realized.         Hoping to prevent conflict with Indian tribes in the Ohio Valley, Parliament passed the Proclamation of 1763, which forbade the colonists to purchase land or settle west of the Appalachian Mountains.François Furstenberg.       2008. 

5924. The prohibition in the First Amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both English precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches.         The Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property, was also new.       

5960. Although the data reflect 2013 results, the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years.         For the federal government, 47 percent of 2013 revenue came from individual income taxes and 34 percent from payroll taxes, which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax.       

5966.         When the bank’s charter expired in 1811, Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal.       However, the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812, coupled with the fragility of the country’s financial system, convinced Congress and then-president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. 

6002. Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras, most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded.         The Social Security Act of 1935, which created federal subsidies for state-administered programs for the elderly; people with handicaps; dependent mothers; and children, gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels.       The unemployment insurance program, also created by the Social Security Act, requires states to provide jobless benefits, but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits.
