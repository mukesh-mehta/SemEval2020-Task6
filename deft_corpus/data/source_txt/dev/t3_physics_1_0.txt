2669.          A diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free-body diagram.       Only forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. 

2702. Average speed, however, is very different from average velocity.         Average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.       

2738. The quantities that might differ between them are volume and density.Section SummaryNewtonâ€™s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.         This is also known as the law of inertia.       

2894. The driving force puts energy into the system at a certain frequency, not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system.         The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force.Most of us have played with toys involving an object supported on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in [link].       Imagine the finger in the figure is your finger.
