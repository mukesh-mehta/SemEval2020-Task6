2646.          In each of these situations, an object has a velocity relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground.       The velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in [link] and [link]. 
2874. Unfortunately, this is impossible.         The second law of thermodynamics also states, with regard to using heat transfer to do work (the second expression of the second law):       
2925. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.         Elephants are known to respond to frequencies below 20 Hz.The perception of frequency is called pitch.       Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another. 
2931. (See [link].)         In this experiment, Franklin demonstrated a connection between lightning and static electricity.       Sparks were drawn from a key hung on a kite string during an electrical storm.
