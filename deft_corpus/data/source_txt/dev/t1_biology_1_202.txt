699.         With the advancement of DNA technology, the area of molecular systematics, which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis, has blossomed.       New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also uncover previously made errors. 

729. Then, mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome.         Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA, but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase, necessary for genome replication.       The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in [link] with examples of each group.
