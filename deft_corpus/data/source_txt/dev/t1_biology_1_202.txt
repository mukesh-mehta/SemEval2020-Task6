619. Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis.Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology.         Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system.       The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data. 
796. This definition also includes re-emerging diseases that were previously under control.         Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin.       Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, and necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging. 
808. As cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration.         In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn Margulis developed endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such.       In 1967, Margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence. 
832. They vary in their oxygen requirement.         Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive.       Other species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are are obligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them.
