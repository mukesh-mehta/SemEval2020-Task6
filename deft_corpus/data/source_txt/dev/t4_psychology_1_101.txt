3617. Generally, you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D.         When we do this, we are relying on a number of monocular cues, or cues that require only one eye.       If you think you can’t see depth with one eye, note that you don’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking—and, in fact, we have more monocular cues than binocular cues. 

3635. One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière's disease.         Although not well understood, Ménière's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing), vertigo (a sense of spinning), and an increase in pressure within the inner ear (Semaan & Megerian, 2011).       This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearing aids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option. 

3644.          Many species respond to chemical messages, known as pheromones, sent by another individual (Wysocki & Preti, 2004).       Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate. 

3758.         Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation.       Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well-developed short story. 

3764. Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “outside the box;” it allows an individual to arrive at unique, multiple solutions to a given problem.         In contrast, convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well-established answer or solution to a problem (Cropley, 2006; Gilford, 1967)
