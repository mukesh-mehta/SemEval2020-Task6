3684. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus.         Now we turn to the second type of associative learning, operant conditioning.       In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a behavior and its consequence ([link]). 
3696. Each time the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out.         When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior, it is called continuous reinforcement.       This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior. 
3720.         An event schema, also known as a cognitive script, is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine.       Think about what you do when you walk into an elevator ([link]). 
3735.         Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result.       Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on Saturday in Philadelphia.
