6109. Another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity, acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards.         Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity, having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building, “I know it when I see it.” Into the early twentieth century, written work was frequently banned as being obscene, including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller, although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone.       In 1973, the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene: “(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). However, the application of this standard has at times been problematic. 

6169.         At the end of the Civil War, the South entered a period called Reconstruction (1865–1877) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union.       As part of this process, the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery. 

6178. Similarly, state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods blacks and whites could live in.         Collectively, these discriminatory laws came to be known as Jim Crow laws.       The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause, and allowed segregation to continue.Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). 

6190. The slow rate of progress led to frustration within the African American community.         Newer, grassroots organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) challenged the NAACP’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal-focused strategy.       These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches, including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations. 

6226. Women are also represented in all branches of the military and can serve in combat.         As a result of the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, women now have legal access to abortion.Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).       

6253. Hans Enoksen, former prime minister of Greenland, receives a helping hand at the polls from five-year-old Pipaluk Petersen (a).

6265. Traditional conservatism supports the authority of the monarchy and the church, believing government provides the rule of law and maintains a society that is safe and organized.         Modern conservatism differs from traditional conservatism in assuming elected government will guard individual liberties and provide laws.       Modern conservatives also prefer a smaller government that stays out of the economy, allowing the market and business to determine prices, wages, and supply. 

6274.         A few years later, Thomas Dewey lost the 1948 presidential election to Harry Truman, despite polls showing Dewey far ahead and Truman destined to lose ([link]).       More recently, John Zogby, of Zogby Analytics, went public with his prediction that John Kerry would win the presidency against incumbent president George W. Bush in 2004, only to be proven wrong on election night.
