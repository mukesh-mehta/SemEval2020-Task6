1213. Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand.         Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1Â mm are called silt, and even smaller particles, less than 0.002 mm in diameter, are called clay.       Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand, silt, and humus; these soils are called loams. 
1264. As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza.         Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip.       Upon exposure to light (i.e. 
1321.         Neural Control of ThermoregulationThe nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in [link].       The processes of homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain. 
1336. A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in [link].         The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices.       The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5.
