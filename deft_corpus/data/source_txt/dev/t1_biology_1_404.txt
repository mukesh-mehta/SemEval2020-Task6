1236. The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther.         In a plantâ€™s male reproductive organs, development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium ([link]).       The microsporangia, which are usually bi-lobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains. 

1266. Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings.         Some seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate.       This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring. 

1293. A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions.         A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves.       A frontal plane (also called a coronal plane) separates the front from the back.
