696. Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized.         Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called binomial nomenclature.       Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus. 
726. Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA.         Intermediates of dsRNA, called replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA.       Multiple, full-length RNA strands of negative polarity (complimentary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from these intermediates, which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity, including both full-length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs.
