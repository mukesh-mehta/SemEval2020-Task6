622. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries.         Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet.       In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. 

799. Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of MRSA targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities.         The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that, among MRSA-afflicted persons in healthcare facilities, the average age is 68, whereas people with “community-associated MRSA” (CA-MRSA) have an average age of 23.2This scanning electron micrograph shows methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, commonly known as MRSA.

811. Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off an intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole ([link]).         The vesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a phagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism.       Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis.The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle, the digestion of the particle using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell. 

835.         Fungi are mostly saprobes (saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.       They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter: mainly plant material.
