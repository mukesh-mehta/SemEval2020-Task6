2117.         Europe’s feudal society was a mutually supportive system.       The lords owned the land; knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice; serfs worked the land in return for the protection offered by the lord’s castle or the walls of his city, into which they fled in times of danger from invaders. 
2132. Huge storehouses were filled with food for times of need.         Each peasant also worked for the Inca ruler a number of days per month on public works projects, a requirement known as the mita.       For example, peasants constructed rope bridges made of grass to span the mountains above fast-flowing icy rivers. 
2159. In reality, the encomienda system exploited native workers.         It was eventually replaced by another colonial labor system, the repartimiento, which required Indian towns to supply a pool of labor for Spanish overlords.       
2219. Conservative Whigs believed in government by a patrician class, a ruling group composed of a small number of privileged families.         Radical Whigs favored broadening the popular participation in political life and pushed for democracy.       The great debate after independence was secured centered on this question: Who should rule in the new American republic? 
2246. For $15 million—a bargain price, considering the amount of land involved—the United States doubled in size.         Perhaps the greatest real estate deal in American history, the Louisiana Purchase greatly enhanced the Jeffersonian vision of the United States as an agrarian republic in which yeomen farmers worked the land.       Jefferson also wanted to bolster trade in the West, seeing the port of New Orleans and the Mississippi River (then the western boundary of the United States) as crucial to American agricultural commerce. 
2252. Specialization meant the work was broken down into specific tasks, and workers repeatedly did the one task assigned to them in the course of a day.         As machines took over labor from humans and people increasingly found themselves confined to the same repetitive step, the process of deskilling began.       
2312. In 1855, Tennessee-born William Walker, along with an army of no more than sixty mercenaries, gained control of the Central American nation of Nicaragua.         Previously, Walker had launched a successful invasion of Mexico, dubbing his conquered land the Republic of Sonora.       In a relatively short period of time, Walker was dislodged from Sonora by Mexican authorities and forced to retreat back to the United States. 
2402. State and federal challenges arose, due to the obvious appearance of a monopoly, which implied sole ownership of all enterprises composing an entire industry.         When the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the Standard Oil Company must dissolve, as its monopoly control over all refining operations in the U.S. was in violation of state and federal statutes, Rockefeller shifted to yet another legal entity, called a holding company model.       The holding company model created a central corporate entity that controlled the operations of multiple companies by holding the majority of stock for each enterprise.
