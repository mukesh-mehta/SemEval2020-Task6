2117.         Europe’s feudal society was a mutually supportive system.       The lords owned the land; knights gave military service to a lord and carried out his justice; serfs worked the land in return for the protection offered by the lord’s castle or the walls of his city, into which they fled in times of danger from invaders. 

2120. Near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, a prophet named Muhammad received a revelation that became a cornerstone of the Islamic faith.         The Koran contained his message, affirming monotheism but identifying Christ not as God but as a prophet like Moses, Abraham, David, and Muhammad.       Following Muhammad’s death in 632, Islam spread by both conversion and military conquest across the Middle East and Asia Minor to India and northern Africa, crossing the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain in the year 711 ([link]).In the seventh and eighth centuries, Islam spread quickly across North Africa and into the Middle East. 

2135.         Elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in 1584, when Sir Walter Raleigh, a favorite of the queen’s, attempted to establish a colony at Roanoke, an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina.       The colony was small, consisting of only 117 people, who suffered a poor relationship with the local Indians, the Croatans, and struggled to survive in their new land ([link]). 

2162.         Once sold to traders, all slaves sent to America endured the hellish Middle Passage, the transatlantic crossing, which took one to two months.       By 1625, more than 325,800 Africans had been shipped to the New World, though many thousands perished during the voyage. 

2222. Enlightenment political thought profoundly influenced Adams and other revolutionary leaders seeking to create viable republican governments.         The ideas of the French philosopher Montesquieu, who had advocated the separation of powers in government, guided Adams’s thinking.       Responding to a request for advice on proper government from North Carolina, Adams wrote Thoughts on Government, which influenced many state legislatures. 

2249.         During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, artisans—skilled, experienced craft workers—produced goods by hand.       The production of shoes provides a good example. 

2255. The Land Law of 1800 further encouraged land sales in the Northwest Territory by reducing the minimum parcel size by half and enabling sales on credit, with the goal of stimulating settlement by ordinary farmers.         The government created land offices to handle these sales and established them in the West within easy reach of prospective landowners.       They could thus purchase land directly from the government, at the price the government had set. 

2315.         Missionaries and circuit riders (ministers without a fixed congregation) brought the message of the awakening across the United States, including into the lives of slaves.       The revival spurred many slaveholders to begin encouraging their slaves to become Christians. 

2405.         In one night, however, the KOL’s popularity—and indeed the momentum of the labor movement as a whole—plummeted due to an event known as the Haymarket affair, which occurred on May 4, 1886, in Chicago’s Haymarket Square ([link]).       There, an anarchist group had gathered in response to a death at an earlier nationwide demonstration for the eight-hour workday.
