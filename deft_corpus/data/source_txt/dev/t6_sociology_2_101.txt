5605.          Globalization refers to the process of integrating governments, cultures, and financial markets through international trade into a single world market.       Often, the process begins with a single motive, such as market expansion (on the part of a corporation) or increased access to healthcare (on the part of a nonprofit organization). 
5629. Though family and other societal models help guide a person toward a career, personal choice plays a role.         In class systems, people have the option to form exogamous marriages, unions of spouses from different social categories.       Marriage in these circumstances is based on values such as love and compatibility rather than on social standing or economics. 
5716. These differences are based on cultural attitudes toward aging.         In China, several studies have noted the attitude of filial piety (deference and respect to one’s parents and ancestors in all things) as defining all other virtues (Hsu 1971; Hamilton 1990).       Cultural attitudes in Japan prior to approximately 1986 supported the idea that the elderly deserve assistance (Ogawa and Retherford 1993). 
5728.          The earliest gerontological theory in the functionalist perspective is disengagement theory, which suggests that withdrawing from society and social relationships is a natural part of growing old.       There are several main points to the theory. 
5737. Not even sociologists are able to agree on a single meaning.         For our purposes, we’ll define marriage as a legally recognized social contract between two people, traditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of the union.       In practicing cultural relativism, we should also consider variations, such as whether a legal union is required (think of “common law” marriage and its equivalents), or whether more than two people can be involved (consider polygamy). 
5758. Infants are also often victims of physical abuse, particularly in the form of violent shaking.         This type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken-baby syndrome, which describes a group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal hemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing impact to an infant’s head.       A baby’s cry is the number one trigger for shaking.
