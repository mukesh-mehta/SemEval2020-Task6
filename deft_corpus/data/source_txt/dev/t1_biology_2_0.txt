12. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment.         The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about.       Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor. 
75. To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction.         However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action.       These reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood. 
78.          This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer.       As [link] illustrates, sodium (Na)  only has one electron in its outer electron shell. 
117. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts.         This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.”
