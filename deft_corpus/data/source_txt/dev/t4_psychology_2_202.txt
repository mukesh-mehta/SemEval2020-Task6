3929. Consider, for example, a child’s physical growth: adding inches to her height year by year.         In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuous believe that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages.       With this type of development, the change is more sudden, such as an infant’s ability to conceive object permanence. 
3938.         Jean Piaget (1896–1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development ([link]).       Instead of approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s cognitive growth. 
3965. How did you come to be who you are?         From beginning as a one-cell structure to your birth, your prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence.       
4013. An especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986).         The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitude change approach—that is, features of the source of the persuasive message, contents of the message, and characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur.       According to the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a persuasive message: central and peripheral ([link]). 
4022.         In normative social influence, people conform to the group norm to fit in, to feel good, and to be accepted by the group.       However, with informational social influence, people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information, particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous. 
4046. People often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age.         These judgments and expectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.       Typically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults.
