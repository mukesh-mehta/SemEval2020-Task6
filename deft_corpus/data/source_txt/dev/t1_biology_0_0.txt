182. If you examine  [link]b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall.         The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell.       Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls.
