5. Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics ([link]).         However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences.       Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above. 

41. The evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree ([link]).         A phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both.       A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. 

128.         Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature.       This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds. 

155. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings.         Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure ([link]).       Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. 

185. If you look at  [link]b, you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell.         The central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions.       Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts?
