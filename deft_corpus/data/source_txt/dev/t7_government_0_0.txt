5817. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles.         In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should…almost entirely unregulated.       

5820. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf.         Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority.       If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted. 

5874. Thus, powers given to the central government were severely limited.         The Confederation Congress, formerly the Continental Congress, had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Indian tribes, declare war, coin currency and borrow money, and settle disputes between states.       Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress; these men could be recalled at any time. 

5889.         After debating at length over whether the Virginia Plan or the New Jersey Plan provided the best model for the nation’s legislature, the framers of the Constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the Great Compromise, suggested by Roger Sherman of Connecticut.       Congress, it was decided, would consist of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. 

5919.         The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti-Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government.       Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights. 

5955. 74 Haw.         530. To address this concern, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.       The law declared that “No state (or other political subdivision within the United States) need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex, even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state.” The law also barred federal benefits for same-sex partners. 

6006. The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “devolution revolution” in U.S. federalism, in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution.         In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, congressional leaders together with President Reagan consolidated numerous federal grant programs related to social welfare and reformulated them in order to give state and local administrators greater discretion in using federal funds.Allen Schick.       2007. 

6021. Finally, some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations, whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments.         For example, the Clean Air Act sets air quality regulations but instructs states to design implementation plans to achieve such standards ([link]).Martha Derthick.       1987. 

6027.         Immigration federalism describes the gradual movement of states into the immigration policy domain.Carol M. Swain and Virgina M. Yetter.       (2014).
