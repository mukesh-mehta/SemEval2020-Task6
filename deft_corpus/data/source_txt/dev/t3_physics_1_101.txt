2946. Contact forces, such as between a baseball and a bat, are explained on the small scale by the interaction of the charges in atoms and molecules in close proximity.         They interact through forces that include the Coulomb force.       Action at a distance is a force between objects that are not close enough for their atoms to “touch.” That is, they are separated by more than a few atomic diameters. 
2952. Polarity of Water MoleculesThe best example of this charge screening is the water molecule, represented as H2OH2O.         Water is a strongly polar molecule.       Its 10 electrons (8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms) tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei. 
3075.          Radar is a common application of microwaves that was first developed in World War II.       By detecting and timing microwave echoes, radar systems can determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft. 
3129. Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them.         Such substances are said to be optically active.       Examples include sugar water, insulin, and collagen (see [link]). 
3135. The Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of the Earth about the Sun. 
3162. This can be observed with a microscope for any small particles in a fluid.         The motion is caused by the random thermal motions of fluid molecules colliding with particles in the fluid, and it is now called Brownian motion.       (See [link].) 
3168.          [link] shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states.       In the present discussion, we take these to be the allowed energy levels of the electron.
