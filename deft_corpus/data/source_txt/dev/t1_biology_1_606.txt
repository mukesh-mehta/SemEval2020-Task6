1822.         Malpighian Tubules of InsectsMalpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in [link].       They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. 
1837. PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment.         A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue.       Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. 
1921. A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH.         The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high.       This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. 
1933. The cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells.         This process is called gastrulation.       During gastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells. 
1948. No species exists everywhere; for example, the Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina.         An endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size.       Other species are generalists: species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of North and Central America. 
1981. The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth’s surface.         Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon dioxide rises, global temperature rises.       Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006. 
1984. Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations.         For example, life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates.       In fact, while the term “demographics” is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach. 
2002.         Efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child.       Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child. 
2014.         Foundation species are considered the “base” or “bedrock” of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure.       They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. 
2017. For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin.         Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome.       Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species. 
2074. For these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions.         Experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm.       A major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. 
2083.         Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level.       Assimilation is the biomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste. 
2089. [link] illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth’s major water reservoirs.         Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir.       A large amount of the Earth’s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the ground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate). 
2092. Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth’s ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing climate change.         A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.
