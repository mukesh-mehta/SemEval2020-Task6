1929. To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg.         If this mechanism fails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy.       The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days. 

1980. Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate.         When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth, gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping.       The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and ozone.
