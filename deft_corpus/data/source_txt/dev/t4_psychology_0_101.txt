3622. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window.         As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates hair cells, which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane.       The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea. 

3625.          The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies.       More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. 

3676. Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let’s take a look at some of the general processes involved.         In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus.       During acquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself. 

3817. Or does being happy make you smile?         The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions, meaning that smiling can make you feel happier (Buck, 1980; Soussignan, 2001; Strack, Martin, & Stepper, 1988).       Recent research explored how Botox, which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression, might affect emotion. 

3856. Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage.         Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.       In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages: Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. 

3862. Then, information in short-term memory goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or close a web browser).         This step of rehearsal, the conscious repetition of information to be remembered, to move STM into long-term memory is called memory consolidation.       

3865. (Note: Sometimes, but not always, the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably.         )Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness.       They are memories formed from behaviors. 

3880.          Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories, you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories (procedural memory, motor learning, and classical conditioning), thanks to your cerebellum ([link]).       For example, one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air. 

3886. He disagreed, however, with Skinner’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning.         He presented a social-cognitive theory of personality that emphasizes both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality.       In social-cognitive theory, the concepts of reciprocal determinism, observational learning, and self-efficacy all play a part in personality development. 

3889.         Julian Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control, another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development.       Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities, locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives.
