4918. To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level.         This model is called the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.       This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. 

4969. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run.         Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run       

4975. One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed.         The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them.       In an economy where most people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly. 

5065. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments.         The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP.       

5077. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate.         A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting.       Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion. 

5101. First, PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics.         Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars.       When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. 

5110. Exchange rates would bounce around less, too.         The economist Milton Friedman (1912–2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book Capitalism and Freedom:Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates.       When we support a free price system [for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. 

5158. A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital.         If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital.       When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as crowding out.To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. 

5161.         At this point, you may wonder about the Federal Reserve.       After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising? 

5173. The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries.         Aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.Geographic and Demographic Differences       

5182. Unemployment rates in the nations of Europe have typically been higher than in the United States.         In 2006, before the start of the Great Recession, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6%, compared with 9% in France, 10.4% in Germany, and 7.1% in Sweden.       The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs.Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. 

5194.         In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.       In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. 

5197. Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods.         The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity.       For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, its labor, land and financial resources cannot be used to produce other goods such as corn.
