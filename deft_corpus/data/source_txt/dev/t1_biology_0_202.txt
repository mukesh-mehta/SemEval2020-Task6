656. Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring.         In the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies.       
659. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence.         An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect.       Natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population. 
701. For example, in [link], all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs.         Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a monophyletic group.       Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point. 
764.         Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there was no molecular oxygen.       Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen—anaerobic organisms—were able to live. 
899. Seedless plants have historically played a role in human life through uses as tools, fuel, and medicine.         Dried peat moss, Sphagnum, is commonly used as fuel in some parts of Europe and is considered a renewable resource.       Sphagnum bogs ([link]) are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes.
