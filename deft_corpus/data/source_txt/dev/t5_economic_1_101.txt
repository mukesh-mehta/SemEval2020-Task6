4646.         A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions.       A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively, rather than as individuals. 
4661.         Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination.       Affirmative action, in its limited and not especially controversial form, means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs. 
4679. Driving a certain car, drinking a particular soda, or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically, if at all.         The government rules on advertising, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product.       They, however, also demand that if a claim is presented as a fact, it must be true. 
4727. An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties; for example, a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary.         In financial capital markets, banks are an example of a financial intermediaryâ€”that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank.       When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet.
