6717. In the 1910s, Edith Bolling Wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, afflicted by a stroke, in the last years of his presidency.         However, as the niece of one president and the wife of another, it was Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more.       

6723.         The increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the 1980s with Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” antidrug campaign and in the early 1990s with Barbara Bush’s efforts on behalf of literacy.       The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform, a controversial decision that did not meet with political success. 

6750. In their first case of significance, Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state, and that Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit.Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793). However, their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment, passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795.         In protecting the states, the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating, “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it.In an atmosphere of perceived weakness, the first chief justice, John Jay, an author of The Federalist Papers and appointed by President George Washington, resigned his post to become governor of New York and later declined President John Adams’s offer of a subsequent term.Associated Press.       “What You Should Know About Forgotten Founding Father John Jay,” PBS Newshour. 

6762. The federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights.         For example, when Samantha Elauf, a Muslim woman, was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company’s dress code, the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated, making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages.       

6876. For instance, most states provide governors the power of the line-item veto.         The line-item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law.       In addition, approximately 30 percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto, which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it. 

6879.         As an example of the Frankenstein veto, when an appropriations bill was sent to Wisconsin governor James E. Doyle for signature in 2005, Doyle scrapped over seven hundred words from a passage that would have appropriated millions of dollars to transportation.       The words that remained in the bill redirected those funds to education. 

6906.         In a council-manager system of government, either the members of the city council are elected by voters along with a mayor who presides over the council, or the voters elect members of the city council and the mayor is chosen from among them.       In either case, the city council will then appoint a city manager to carry out the administrative functions of the municipal government. 

6945. The act’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi-juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints, conducts investigations into possible abuses, and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out.Campbell, “Civil Service Reform,” 100. Over time, Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts.         These include the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which further compelled federal agencies to protect whistleblowers who reasonably perceive that an institution or the people in the institution are acting inappropriately ([link]).       

6954. For example, your home or apartment is a private good reserved for your own use because you pay rent or make mortgage payments for the privilege of living there.         Further, private goods are finite and can run out if overused, even if only in the short term.       The fact that private goods are excludable and finite makes them tradable. 

6957. Forests, water, and fisheries, however, are a type of public good called common goods, which are not excludable but may be finite.         The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them, no one has a financial interest in protecting their long-term or future value.       Without government regulation, a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water, since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else (see [link]). 

6972. After completing a minimum number of years of work, American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age.         It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group, and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment.       The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings. 

7002. If the European continent was stable, so too was the world.         During the Cold War era that followed World War II, stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable.       Until approximately 1989–1990, advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers.
