2424. Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control the president.         The first was Roscoe Conkling, Republican senator from New York and leader of the Stalwarts, a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system ([link]).       Long supporting former President Grant, Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes’ early appeals for civil service reform. 

2466. Carranza refused to work with Wilson and the U.S. government, and instead threatened to defend Mexico’s mineral rights against all American oil companies established there.         Wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed Carranza, most notably Pancho Villa ([link]).       However, Villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake Carranza; in 1915, Wilson reluctantly authorized official U.S. recognition of Carranza’s government. 

2562. For Carmichael, Black Power was the power of African Americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white-dominated ones, an idea also espoused in the 1920s by political leader and orator Marcus Garvey.         Like Garvey, Carmichael became an advocate of black separatism, arguing that African Americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves.       In keeping with this philosophy, Carmichael expelled SNCC’s white members.
