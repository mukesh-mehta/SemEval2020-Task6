3252. The division between mesons and baryons is actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with their masses.         Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons, which implies that mesons are not conserved in number.       Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon. 
3261.          What’s Color got to do with it?—A Whiter Shade of PaleAs mentioned and shown in [link], quarks carry another quantum number, which we call color.       Of course, it is not the color we sense with visible light, but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors. 
3276. After this time, the forces become distinct in almost all interactions—they are no longer unified or symmetric.         This transition from GUT to electroweak is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, in which conditions spontaneously evolved to a point where the forces were no longer unified, breaking that symmetry.       This is analogous to a phase transition in the universe, and a clever proposal by American physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980s ties it to the smoothness of the CMBR. 
3282. It is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept, including Einstein, firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects.Black holes are difficult to observe directly, because they are small and no light comes directly from them.         In fact, no light comes from inside the event horizon, which is defined to be at a distance from the object at which the escape velocity is exactly the speed of light.       The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwarzschild radius RSRS size 12{R rSub { size 8{S} } } {} and is given by
