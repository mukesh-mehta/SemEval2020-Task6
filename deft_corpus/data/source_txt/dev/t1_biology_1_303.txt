954. Bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development.         Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids.       Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms. 

1071. One of the oldest known amniotes is Casineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics.         One of the earliest undisputed reptiles was Hylonomus.       Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three groups—synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids—during the Permian period. 

1077. Mammalian integument, or skin, includes secretory glands with various functions.         Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication.       Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body. 

1104. These proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available.         The oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is Plesiadapis (although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a proto-primate).       Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago. 

1113.         There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens.       As discussed earlier, H. erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago. 

1116. Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue.         Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth.       Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant. 

1188.         The aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response.       Like all plant photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore.
