934. Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte, spreading the plant’s genes.         The seed offers the embryo protection, nourishment, and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years, ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal.       Seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time. 
937.         Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary AdaptationAngiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower.       Both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations. 
943. This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage, the gastrula, in which the future digestive cavity is formed.         Different cell layers (called germ layers) are formed during gastrulation.       These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types, organs, and organ systems during a process called organogenesis. 
946. Only a few animal groups display radial symmetry.         All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animal’s lifestyle.Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a drinking glass or pie.       It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, or front or back. 
952. Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes, also known as flatworms.         Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates (or coelomates) ([link]).       A true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane. 
958. The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely, meaning that during development, a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom.         Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely.       Here, the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue. 
961. There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes.         In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage.       This means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined. 
970.         The invertebrates, or invertebrata, are animals that do not contain bony structures, such as the cranium and vertebrae.       The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans, which include only the phylum Porifera: the sponges ([link]).
