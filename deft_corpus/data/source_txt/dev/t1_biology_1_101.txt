312. It is at this step in the reaction center, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron.         All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex.       The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI. 

393. Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell.         This type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission.Binary Fission       

405. The synaptonemal complex, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes.         The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis.       In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other.
