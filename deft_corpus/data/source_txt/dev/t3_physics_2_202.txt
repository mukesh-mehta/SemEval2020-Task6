3254. But baryons have B=+1B=+1 size 12{B"=+"1} {} if they are matter, and B=−1B=−1 size 12{B= - 1} {} if they are antimatter.         The conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics, where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays.       That rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number. 
3257. (Whimsical names are common in particle physics, reflecting the personalities of modern physicists.)         Originally, three quark types—or flavors—were proposed to account for the then-known mesons and baryons.       These quark flavors are named up (u), down (d), and strange (s). 
3263. Color is consistent with all observations and is now widely accepted.         Quark theory including color is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), also named by Gell-Mann.
