3255. Quarks have been mentioned at various points in this text as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive club of truly elementary particles.         Note that an elementary or fundamental particle has no substructure (it is not made of other particles) and has no finite size other than its wavelength.       This does not mean that fundamental particles are stable—some decay, while others do not. 

3264. The analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good—the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances, but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale, and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable.         The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics.       Frontiers of Physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology, on the opposite end of the distance scale.[link] is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0} } } {}, similar to the diagrams in [link] and [link] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces. 

3279. By 1916, he had laid the foundation of general relativity, again almost on his own.         Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations—doing this is to perform a thought experiment.       [link] illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field. 

3285. Gravitational wavesIf a massive object distorts the space around it, like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond, then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond.         Gravitational waves are mass-created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity.       Since gravity is by far the weakest force, extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves.
