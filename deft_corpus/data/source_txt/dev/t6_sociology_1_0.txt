5308. They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior, especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors.         Emergent norm theory asserts that, in this circumstance, people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular (individual) set of norms, which may change as the crowd experience evolves.       This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective.For Turner and Killian, the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation, or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar. 

5455. In the 1850s, as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved, suburbs developed.         Suburbs are the communities surrounding cities, typically close enough for a daily commute in, but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords.       The bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl. 

5479. Societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve from unindustrialized to postindustrial.         Demographic transition theory (Caldwell and Caldwell 2006) suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four-stage model.In Stage 1, birth, death, and infant mortality rates are all high, while life expectancy is short.       An example of this stage is the 1800s in the United States. 

5482.          Moral development is an important part of the socialization process.       The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “good” and “bad,” which is important for a smoothly functioning society. 

5506. A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution.         In contrast, a laissez-faire leader (French for “leave it alone”) is hands-off, allowing group members to self-manage and make their own decisions.       An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard, leaves materials on the shelves, and tells students to help themselves and make some art. 

5512. The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations.         Coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced, or pushed, to join.       These may include prison or a rehabilitation center.
