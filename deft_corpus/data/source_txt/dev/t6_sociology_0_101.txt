5739. Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them.         A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born.       A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage. 
5745. Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time.         The reverse, when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time, is called polyandry.       It is far less common and only occurs in about 1 percent of the world’s cultures (Altman and Ginat 1996). 
5748. This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent.         Note that kinship, or one’s traceable ancestry, can be based on blood or marriage or adoption.       Sixty percent of societies, mostly modernized nations, follow a bilateral descent pattern. 
5754. While sociologists use the family life cycle to study the dynamics of family over time, consumer and marketing researchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as they progress through each stage (Murphy and Staples 1979).As early “stage” theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not accounting for differences in gender, ethnicity, culture, and lifestyle, less rigid models of the family life cycle have been developed.         One example is the family life course, which recognizes the events that occur in the lives of families but views them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages (Strong and DeVault 1992).       This type of model accounts for changes in family development, such as the fact that in today’s society, childbearing does not always occur with marriage. 
5766.         A denomination is a large, mainstream religious organization, but it does not claim to be official or state sponsored.       It is one religion among many. 
5784.          This story illustrates a growing concern referred to as grade inflation—a term used to describe the observation that the correspondence between letter grades and the achievements they reflect has been changing (in a downward direction) over time.       Put simply, what used to be considered C-level, or average, now often earns a student a B, or even an A.
