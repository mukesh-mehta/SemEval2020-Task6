5608. For example, in maquiladoras, mostly found in northern Mexico, workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments.Globalization also brings an international division of labor, in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low-wage labor pool of peripheral and semi-peripheral nations.         This can lead to a sense of xenophobia, which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods.       Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of this risk and attempt to “Americanize” their products, selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were nevertheless made in Mexico. 

5632. Status ConsistencySocial stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income, education, and occupation.         Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency, or lack thereof, of an individual’s rank across these factors.       Caste systems correlate with high status consistency, whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency. 

5719. Each person experiences age-related changes based on many factors.         Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging, while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging (Whitbourne and Whitbourne 2010).       

5731. There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective.         Modernization theory (Cowgill and Holmes 1972) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization.       As societies modernize, the status of elders decreases, and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion. 

5740. A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born.         A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage.       These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage.Drawing on two sociological paradigms, the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism. 

5761. Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “the divine.” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate.         Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true, such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God, or that reincarnation exists.       Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions.
