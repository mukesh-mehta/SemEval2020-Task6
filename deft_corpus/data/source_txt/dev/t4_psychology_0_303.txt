4228. These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions, which involve the (false) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person.         People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions, beliefs that one holds special power, unique knowledge, or is extremely important.       For example, the person who claims to be Jesus Christ, or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years, or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions.
