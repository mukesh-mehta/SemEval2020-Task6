Economists like Tyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University, are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology, and those who do not.       According to Cowen author of the recent book, Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation, this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills, and ultimately, in wages and global standards of living. 

4649.         This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product, but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms.       At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium. 

4664. One disruptive effect, as just noted, is that immigration weighted toward low-skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers.         A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each 10% rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market, high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3%.       The effects on wages of low-skill workers are not large—perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%.

Yet another approach is to require collateral, often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid.

With a CD, as it is commonly called, you agree to deposit a certain amount of money, often measured in thousands of dollars, in the account for a stated period of time, typically ranging from a few months to several years.
