6432. But even stretching the truth can be costly for a publisher.         In 2010, Star magazine published a headline, “Addiction Nightmare: Katie Drug Shocker,” leading readers to believe actress Katie Holmes was taking drugs.       While the article in the magazine focuses on the addictive quality of Scientology sessions rather than drugs, the implication and the headline were different. 
6447.         In his 2008 presidential run, Barack Obama promised to run a transparent White House.Christopher Beam, “The TMI President,” Slate, 12 November 2008. Yet once in office, he found that transparency makes it difficult to get work done, and so he limited access and questions.       In his first year in office, George W. Bush, who was criticized by Obama as having a closed government, gave 147 question-and-answer sessions with journalists, while Obama gave only 46. 
6471. Then, legislative seats are doled out to the parties based on the proportion of support each party receives.         While the Green Party in the United States might not win a single congressional seat in some years thanks to plurality voting, in a proportional system, it stands a chance to get a few seats in the legislature regardless.       For example, assume the Green Party gets 7 percent of the vote. 
6483. By fostering a sense of loyalty, a party can insulate itself from changes in the system and improve its odds of winning elections.         The party-in-the-electorate are those members of the voting public who consider themselves to be part of a political party and/or who consistently prefer the candidates of one party over the other.       
6507.         However, in its one-person-one-vote decision in Reynolds v. Simms (1964), the Supreme Court argued that everyone’s vote should count roughly the same regardless of where they lived.Reynolds v. Simms, 379 U.S. 870 (1964). Districts had to be adjusted so they would have roughly equal populations.       Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles (1970–1972 and 1980–1982). 
6540. Lobbyists representing a variety of organizations employ different techniques to achieve their objectives.         One method is inside lobbying or direct lobbying, which takes the interest group’s message directly to a government official such as a lawmaker.Nownes and Newmark, “Interest Groups in the States.” Inside lobbying tactics include testifying in legislative hearings and helping to draft legislation.       Numerous surveys of lobbyists have confirmed that the vast majority rely on these inside strategies. 
6549. AARP, for example, offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members, while dues are very low, so they can actually save money by joining.         Group leaders may also offer solidary incentives, which provide the benefit of joining with others who have the same concerns or are similar in other ways.       Some scholars suggest that people are naturally drawn to others with similar concerns.
