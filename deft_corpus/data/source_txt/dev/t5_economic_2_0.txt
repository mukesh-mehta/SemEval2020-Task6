4313. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life.         Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available.       Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. 

4316.         First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage.       (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) 

4319. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.         Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.       For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.
