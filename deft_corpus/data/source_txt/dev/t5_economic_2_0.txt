4318. A similar pattern often operates within businesses.         In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.       Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.

4396. Whatever the firm’s quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit.         As explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are often sunk costs that cannot be recouped.       In thinking about what to do next, sunk costs should typically be ignored, since this spending has already been made and cannot be changed. 
4399. Many industries experience economies of scale.         Economies of scale refers to the situation where, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down.       This is the idea behind “warehouse stores” like Costco or Walmart.
