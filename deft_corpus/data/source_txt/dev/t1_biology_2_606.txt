1825. Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water.         Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic.       Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes. 

1840.         The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection.       The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen. 

1924.         The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining.       These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days. 

1936. During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion.         As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms.       This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it. 

1951. The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ([link]).         These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers.       In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. 

1984. Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations.         For example, life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates.       In fact, while the term “demographics” is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach. 

1987.         For mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, a technique called mark and recapture is often used.       This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is collected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked ([link]). 

2005. While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals.         In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one.       Assuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. 

2017. For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin.         Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome.       Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species. 

2020. Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time.         In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain.       

2077. An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics.         A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics.       Ideally, these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers (such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health. 

2086. One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification.         Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the apex consumers.       Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which was published in the 1960s bestseller, Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson. 

2092. Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth’s ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing climate change.         A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.       

2095. As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain.         Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems.       Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings.
