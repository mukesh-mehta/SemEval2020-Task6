5305. Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion, often at funerals, weddings, or the like.         The final type, acting crowds, focuses on a specific goal or action, such as a protest movement or riot.In addition to the different types of crowds, collective groups can also be identified in two other ways.       A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest, though they may not be in close proximity (Lofland 1993), such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville. 
5452.          Urbanization is the study of the social, political, and economic relationships in cities, and someone specializing in urban sociology studies those relationships.       In some ways, cities can be microcosms of universal human behavior, while in others they provide a unique environment that yields its own brand of human behavior. 
5476. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) was an English clergyman who made dire predictions about earth’s ability to sustain its growing population.         According to Malthusian theory, three factors would control human population that exceeded the earth’s carrying capacity, or how many people can live in a given area considering the amount of available resources.       Malthus identified these factors as war, famine, and disease (Malthus 1798). 
5479. Societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve from unindustrialized to postindustrial.         Demographic transition theory (Caldwell and Caldwell 2006) suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four-stage model.In Stage 1, birth, death, and infant mortality rates are all high, while life expectancy is short.       An example of this stage is the 1800s in the United States. 
5503. We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader.         In contrast, expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health, and ensuring that people feel supported.       Social and religious leaders—rabbis, priests, imams, directors of youth homes and social service programs—are often perceived as expressive leaders. 
5509. A complaint of modern life is that society is dominated by large and impersonal secondary organizations.         From schools to businesses to healthcare to government, these organizations, referred to as formal organizations, are highly bureaucratized.       Indeed, all formal organizations are, or likely will become, bureaucracies.
