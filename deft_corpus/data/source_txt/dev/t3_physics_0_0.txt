2755.          Conservation of energy (as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed) is based on experiment.       Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy, conservation of energy has always been found to apply. 
2764. An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system.         Friction, for example, creates thermal energy that dissipates, removing energy from the system.       Furthermore, even if the thermal energy is retained or captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well.The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B, as does the work done against friction.
