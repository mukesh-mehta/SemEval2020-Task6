6433. The line between the people’s right to know and national security is not always clear.         In 1971, the Supreme Court heard the Pentagon Papers case, in which the U.S. government sued the New York Times and the Washington Post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the Vietnam War.       The Supreme Court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media, meaning the government can prevent the publication of information, that right is very limited.

But William Tecumseh Sherman, a Union general, maintained distance between the press and his military.       Following the publication of material Sherman believed to be protected by government censorship, a journalist was arrested and nearly put to death.

In 1972, under the cloak of anonymity, the associate director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mark Felt, became a news source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, political reporters at the Washington Post.       Felt provided information about a number of potential stories and was Woodward’s main source for information about President Richard Nixon’s involvement in a series of illegal activities, including the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington’s Watergate office complex.

Stalsburg, “Running with Strollers: The Impact of Family Life on Political Ambition,” Eagleton Institute of Politics, Spring 2012, Unpublished Paper, http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/research/documents/Stalsburg-FamilyLife-Political-Ambition.pdf (August 28, 2015). In 2008, the nomination of Sarah Palin as Republican candidate John McCain’s running mate validated this concern ([link]).       Some articles focused on her qualifications to be a potential future president or her record on the issues. 
6565. Some view the iron triangle idea as outdated.         Hugh Heclo of George Mason University has sketched a more open pattern he calls an issue network that includes a number of different interests and political actors that work together in support of a single issue or policy.Hugh Heclo.       1984.
