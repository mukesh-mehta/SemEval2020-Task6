1528. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced.         ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus.       If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. 

1567. FSH stimulates egg maturation in females, while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone.         Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova.       In females, the pituitary also produces prolactin, which stimulates milk production after childbirth, and oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let-down during suckling.Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use.
