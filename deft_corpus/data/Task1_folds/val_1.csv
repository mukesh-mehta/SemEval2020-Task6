 Gravitational waves are mass - created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity .	1	physics
 The emerging field of complexity is devoted to the study of complex systems , including those outside the traditional bounds of physics .	1	physics
 A bow wake , such as the one in [ link ] , is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed .	1	physics
 A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people . In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .	1	government
 5830 . According to pluralist theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians .	1	government
 5833 . The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .	1	government
 Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .	1	government
 5854 . People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property .	1	government
 The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .	1	government
 5869 . Drafted by Thomas Jefferson , the Declaration of Independence officially proclaimed the colonies’ separation from Britain .	1	government
 Thus , a confederation was created — an entity in which independent , self - governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense .	1	government
 Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .	1	government
 Later , in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison , the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws , a process called judicial review .	1	government
 5896 . All powers not expressly given to the national government , however , were intended to be exercised by the states .	1	government
 5920 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .	1	government
 5926 . The Supreme Court , for example , has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right .	1	government
 The Tenth Amendment , one of the first submitted to the states for ratification , ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution .	1	government
 The Twenty - Second Amendment , added in 1955 , limits the president to two terms in office , and the Twenty - Seventh Amendment , first submitted for ratification in 1789 , regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress .	1	government
 The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .	1	government
 After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .	1	government
 5935 . The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .	1	government
 The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .	1	government
 Under the Articles of Confederation ( the first constitution of the United States ) , states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak .	1	government
 5962 . In 2009 , President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , which provided immediate economic - crisis management assistance such as helping local and state economies ride out the Great Recession and shoring up the country ’s banking sector .	1	government
 5974 . When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .	1	government
 To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry , Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 , which created the Interstate Commerce Commission .	1	government
 Three years later , national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce ( Figure 03_02_Commerce ) .	1	government

 Until then most scholars had thought of federalism as a layer cake , but according to Grodzins the 1930s ushered in “ marble - cake federalism ” ( [ link ] ) : “ The American form of government is often , but erroneously , symbolized by a three - layer cake .	1	government
 Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .	1	government

 In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .	1	government
 Their long - term solution was to propose two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites ; these rights became the Fourteenth Amendment , which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general , and the Fifteenth Amendment , which protected the right to vote in particular ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram , after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman ( 1918–1988 ) who developed it .	1	physics
 Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force , whereas leptons are particles that do not .	1	physics
 3253 . Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons , which implies that mesons are not conserved in number .	1	physics
 Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon .	1	physics
 There is strong evidence that quarks are the fundamental building blocks of hadrons as seen in [ link ] .	1	physics
 This is part of the theory of quark confinement , which explains how quarks can exist and yet never be isolated or directly observed .	1	physics
 In the 1960s , a gauge theory , called electroweak theory , was developed by Steven Weinberg , Sheldon Glashow , and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies .	1	physics
 It looks as if a gigantic explosion , universally called the Big Bang , threw matter out some billions of years ago .	1	physics
 We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .	1	physics
 3277 . We know from Special Relativity that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event , particularly if they move relative to one another .	1	physics
 Einstein ’s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity .	1	physics
 General relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light .	1	physics
 3280 . Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape .	1	physics
 Neutron stars are literally a star composed of neutrons .	1	physics
 3286 . Introduced earlier in GUTS : The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and , thus , must contain quantum gravity .	1	physics
 This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction .	1	physics
 If such bodies pass between us and a star , they will not block the star ’s light , being too small , but they will form a gravitational lens , as discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity . In a process called microlensing , light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner .	1	physics
 These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation .	1	physics
 One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos .	1	physics
 Chaos is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions .	1	physics
 The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift .	1	physics
 Knowing that power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion , what is the expression for electric power ?	1	physics
 He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations , and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him . A synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated .	1	physics
 4619 . Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .	1	economic
 Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .	1	economic
 The poverty line is based on cash income , which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non - cash form , like Medicaid ( health care for low - income individuals and families ) and food aid .	1	economic
 4628 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .	1	economic
 4634 . The safety net includes a number of other programs : government - subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for children from low - income families ; the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) , which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns ; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , which provides help with home heating bills ; housing assistance , which helps pay the rent ; and Supplemental Security Income , which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor .	1	economic
 4640 . Income is a flow of money received , often measured on a monthly or an annual basis ; wealth is the sum of the value of all assets , including money in bank accounts , financial investments , a pension fund , and the value of a home .	1	economic
 The effective income tax , which is total taxes paid divided by total income ( all sources of income such as wages , profits , interest , rental income , and government transfers such as veterans’ benefits ) , was much lower .	1	economic
 It is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers , including the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) ; the Service Employees International Union ; and the National Education Association .	1	economic
 For example , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same .	1	economic
 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .	1	economic
 The effects on wages of low - skill workers are not large — perhaps in the range of decline of about 1 % .	0	economic
 4667 . Many economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information , where either the buyer , the seller , or both , are less than 100 % certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold .	1	economic
 Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .	1	economic
 4670 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .	1	economic
 By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .	1	economic
 4676 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .	1	economic
 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 4682 . Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4685 . Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs .	0	economic
 Some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund , and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments .	0	economic
 Other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up .	0	economic
 4688 . Deposit insurance : Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $ 250,000 ( the amount was raised from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 ) if the bank should go bankrupt .	1	economic
 4691 . Some drivers are safer than others .	0	economic
 A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring .	1	economic
 4694 . For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 4697 . However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .	0	economic
 A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided .	1	economic
 In this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare provider , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later .	0	economic
 4703 . The profit trend has since continued to increase each year , though at a less steady or consistent rate .	0	economic
 ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPATAX ) 2013 reports showed corporate profits after tax were around $ 1,800 billion .	0	economic
 4706 . Venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size , but that have potential to grow substantially .	1	economic
 These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors , including banks , institutions like college endowments , insurance companies that hold financial reserves , and corporate pension funds .	0	economic
 4712 . A corporation is a business that “ incorporates”—that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits ( and losses ) .	1	economic
 Corporations may be private or public , and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded .	0	economic
 4715 . Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	1	economic
 Corporate giants like IBM , AT&T , Ford , General Electric , Microsoft , Merck , and Exxon all have millions of shares of stock .	0	economic
 4718 . Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .	0	economic
 The increase in the value of the stock ( or of any asset ) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain .	1	economic
 4721 . A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners .	0	economic
 Most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales , that do not have publicly issued stock , such as farm products dealer Cargill , the Mars candy company , and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm . When a firm decides to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company .	1	economic
 Shareholders own a public company .	0	economic
 4724 . The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased profitability .	1	economic
 It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .	0	economic
 4730 . Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .	0	economic
 With a CD , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically ranging from a few months to several years .	1	economic
 4733 . A bond is basically an “ I owe you ” note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital ( money ) .	0	economic
 The bond has a face value .	0	economic
 This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .	1	economic
 4736 . The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	1	economic
 This may or may not be the same as the face value .	0	economic
 4739 . The trend in the stock market is generally up over time , but with some large dips along the way .	0	economic

 Broad measures of the stock market , like the ones listed here , tend to move together .	0	economic
 4742 . At the other end of the spectrum , a mutual fund might be quite broad ; at the extreme , some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market .	0	economic
 A mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an index fund .	1	economic
 4745 . Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount .	1	economic
 4748 . A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference .	1	economic
 This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election . In a 1957 work , An Economic Theory of Democracy , the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way : “ It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se .	1	economic
 No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information , or how uncertain he is about which party to support , he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome … He will not even utilize all the free information available , since assimilating it takes time . ” In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two , the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters , who states : “ The chance that one man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election … is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ” The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process : spending .	0	economic
 4751 . ( See the closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire tariff .	0	economic
 ) Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation , but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue .	1	economic
 A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit society as a whole .	0	economic
 4754 . In the early 2000s , about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare , a government program that provides health insurance for those 65 and older .	1	economic
 On some issues , the elderly are a powerful interest group .	0	economic
 4757 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .	0	economic
 However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .	0	economic
 HCAN , spending $ 60 million dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014 .	0	economic
 4760 . A nonprofit watchdog organization , called Citizens against Government Waste , produces an annual report , the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork - barrel spending , focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress , that were passed into law without any public hearings , or that serve only a local purpose .	1	economic
 Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , pork - barrel spending totaled $ 2.7 billion in 2014.Pork - barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor .	1	economic
 For example , if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district , the other members might oppose it .	0	economic
 4763 . This case goes against the theory of the “ median ” voter in a democracy .	0	economic
 The median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences .	1	economic
 If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum .	0	economic
 4766 . These three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions .	0	economic
 As the famous British economist Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago : “ [ E]conomic theory , in itself , preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws .	0	economic
 It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions . ” The study of economics is neither politically conservative , nor moderate , nor liberal .	0	economic
 4769 . How large is the U.S. economy ?	0	economic
 The size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year .	1	economic
 The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services — smart phones , cars , music downloads , computers , steel , bananas , college educations , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and summing them into a total dollar value .	0	economic
 4772 . If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .	0	economic
 Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about 15–18 % of GDP , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created .	0	economic
 However , it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption .	0	economic
 4775 . Since the early 1980s , imports have typically exceeded exports , and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years .	0	economic
 Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 4778 . They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year .	0	economic
 Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting , in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production .	1	economic
 For example , imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer , and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires .	0	economic
 4781 . One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product ( GNP ) .	0	economic
 GDP includes only what is produced within a country ’s borders .	0	economic
 4787 . GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy .	1	economic
 We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter .	0	economic
 4790 . The generally upward long - term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short - term declines .	0	economic
 A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 4793 . [ link ] lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900 .	0	economic
 The highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the trough .	1	economic
 Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 4796 . To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies , it is necessary to convert to a “ common denominator ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency .	1	economic
 Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	0	economic
 4802 . Let ’s begin with a brief overview of the spectacular patterns of economic growth around the world in the last two centuries , commonly referred to as the period of modern economic growth .	1	economic
 ( Later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress . )	0	economic
 4805 . Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition .	0	economic
 Richard Easterlin , an economist at the University of Southern California , wrote in 2000 :	0	economic
 4811 . A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .	1	economic
 In macroeconomics , the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function .	1	economic
 4814 . The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads ( also called infrastructure ) .	1	economic
 Again , greater physical capital implies more output .	0	economic
 4817 . To obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link](a ) by the population .	0	economic
 This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita ( that is , GDP divided by population ) .	1	economic
 The inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link](b ) .	0	economic
 4820 . The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research .	0	economic
 The researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales .	0	economic
 Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies .	0	economic
 4823 . High - income countries must continually invent new technologies , whereas low - income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood .	0	economic
 The economist Alexander Gerschenkron ( 1904–1978 ) gave this phenomenon a memorable name : “ the advantages of backwardness . ” Of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living .	0	economic
 He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up .	0	economic
 4826 . It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking , often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment .	0	economic
 Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force .	0	economic
 4829 . Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate .	0	economic
 This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job .	1	economic
 4832 . One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census .	0	economic
 But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly .	0	economic
 Instead , workers in these countries are engaged in short - term work , subsistence activities , and barter .	0	economic
 4835 . From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle .	0	economic
 In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity .	1	economic
 At the equilibrium wage ( We ) , the equilibrium quantity ( Qe ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers .	0	economic
 4838 . Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few .	0	economic
 A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone .	0	economic
 4841 . The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave .	1	economic
 The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay .	0	economic
 4844 . Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?	0	economic
 Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment .	1	economic
 4847 . Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment .	0	economic
 The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills .	1	economic
 4850 . Moreover , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too .	0	economic
 The second - to - last row of [ link ] shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six - fold from 1970 to 2014 .	0	economic

 4856 . The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .	0	economic
 The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	1	economic
 4859 . If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether .	0	economic
 Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living .	1	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature is a must - read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated .	0	economic
 4862 . It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	0	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 4865 . The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms : they are right after World War I and World War II .	0	economic
 However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s .	1	economic
 ( Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . )	0	economic
 4868 . Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists .	0	economic
 Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation .	0	economic
 One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ” Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree.”The Land of Funny Money	0	economic
 4871 . If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning .	0	economic
 4874 . One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension .	0	economic
 Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement .	1	economic
 For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans .	0	economic
 4877 . High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker .	1	economic
 Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages .	0	economic
 4880 . When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed .	1	economic
 An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 4883 . Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well .	0	economic
 An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 Often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM , compared to a fixed - rate loan .	0	economic
 4886 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 4889 . At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries .	0	economic
 The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year .	0	economic
 This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % .	0	economic
 4892 . Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers .	0	economic
 4895 . Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .	0	economic
 For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) .	1	economic
 The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market .	0	economic
 4898 . As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too .	0	economic
 The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital .	0	economic
 In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments .	0	economic
 4901 . Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country .	0	economic
 Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world .	0	economic
 The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account .	0	economic
 4904 . The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true .	0	economic
 Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital .	0	economic
 4907 . When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health .	0	economic
 But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher .	0	economic
 Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health .	0	economic
 4910 . How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?	0	economic
 Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?	0	economic
 Why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in 2009 ?	0	economic
 4913 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic
 The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall .	0	economic
 4224 . Schizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought , perception , emotion , and behavior .	1	psychology
 About 1 % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood ( early to mid-20s ) .	0	psychology
 4230 . Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes — usually detected by what a person says .	1	psychology
 The person might ramble , exhibit loose associations ( jump from topic to topic ) , or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words .	0	psychology
 4233 . Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors , emotions , or drives ( Green , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions , speech , or movements , even when such expressions are normal or expected .	1	psychology
 4236 . Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use .	0	psychology
 Although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( Thornicroft , 1990 ) , such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice versa .	0	psychology
 4239 . These experiences can include such events as combat , threatened or actual physical attack , sexual assault , natural disasters , terrorist attacks , and automobile accidents .	0	psychology
 This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in which a cause ( extreme trauma ) is explicitly specified . Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event , flashbacks ( states that can last from a few seconds to several days , during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment [ APA , 2013 ] ) , avoidance of stimuli connected to the event , persistently negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , guilt , and shame ) , feelings of detachment from others , irritability , proneness toward outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response ( jumpiness ) .	1	psychology
 For PTSD to be diagnosed , these symptoms must occur for at least one month .	0	psychology
 4248 . Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .	1	psychology
 Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .	1	psychology
 4251 . suicidal ideation : thoughts of death ( not just fear of dying ) , thinking about or planning suicide , or making an actual suicide attempt .	1	psychology
 4254 . People with persistent depressive disorder ( previously known as dysthymia ) experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years , as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder .	1	psychology
 People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy , but do not meet all the criteria for major depression .	0	psychology
 4257 . During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .	1	psychology
 The person may talk loudly and rapidly , exhibiting flight of ideas , abruptly switching from one topic to another .	0	psychology
 These individuals are easily distracted , which can make a conversation very difficult .	0	psychology
 4260 . Another cognitive theory of depression , hopelessness theory , postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness , which then leads to depression ( Abramson , Metalsky , & Alloy , 1989 ) .	1	psychology
 According to this theory , hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes .	1	psychology
 4263 . One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry .	0	psychology
 Contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior ( Pompili et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 Low levels of serotonin predict future suicide attempts and suicide completions , and low levels have been observed post - mortem among suicide victims ( Mann , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 4269 . Although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD , considerable evidence suggests that hoarding represents an entirely different disorder ( Mataix - Cols et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 People with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions , regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are .	1	psychology
 As a result , these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their living areas ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4272 . This woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and duration than would a 21-year - old college junior who is having trouble finding a date for the annual social .	0	psychology
 Some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , persistent , and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one ’s life , this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder . Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Although anxiety is universally experienced , anxiety disorders cause considerable distress .	0	psychology
 4275 . Rachman ( 1977 ) proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways .	0	psychology
 The first pathway is through classical conditioning .	0	psychology
 As you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response ( UCR ) , eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 4278 . When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes .	1	psychology
 Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact , rehearsing sentences before speaking , talking only briefly , and not talking about oneself ( Alden & Bieling , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 4281 . The exact genes and gene functions involved in this disorder , however , are not well - understood ( APA , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 Neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder .	1	psychology
 Located in the brainstem , the locus coeruleus is the brain ’s major source of norepinephrine , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response .	1	psychology
 4284 . For example , an individual may worry about her health and finances , the health of family members , the safety of her children , or minor matters ( e.g. , being late for an appointment ) without having any legitimate reason for doing so ( APA , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 A diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder — what Sigmund Freud referred to as free - floating anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least six months , and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms : restlessness , difficulty concentrating , being easily fatigued , muscle tension , irritability , and sleep difficulties .	1	psychology
 4287 . Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component ; in fact , there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors .	0	psychology
 The graph in [ link ] shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 4290 . A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .	1	psychology
 Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .	1	psychology
 The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 4293 . No universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present ( Zachar & Kendler , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 However , one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield ( 1992 ) , who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction .	0	psychology
 Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms — that is , psychological processes honed by evolution , such as cognition , perception , and learning — have important functions , such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought , problem solving , and communication .	1	psychology
 4296 . THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS ( DSM)Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time , the one that is used by most mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , published by the American Psychiatric Association ( 2013 ) .	0	psychology

 Do you tend to be sociable or shy ?	0	psychology
 4302 . As you have learned in this chapter , personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors .	0	psychology
 The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .	1	psychology
 4305 . One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) , first published in 1943 , with 504 true / false questions , and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989 , with 567 questions .	0	psychology
 The original MMPI was based on a small , limited sample , composed mostly of Minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients ; the revised inventory was based on a more representative , national sample to allow for better standardization .	0	psychology

 A person taking the TAT is shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture .	1	psychology
 2641 . Although displacement is described in terms of direction , distance is not .	0	physics
 Distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions .	1	physics
 Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them .	0	physics
 2644 . Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity .	1	physics
 The object is called a projectile , and its path is called its trajectory . The motion of falling objects , as covered in Problem - Solving Basics for One - Dimensional Kinematics , is a simple one - dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement .	0	physics
 2650 . Dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move .	1	physics
 To understand this , we need a working definition of force .	0	physics

 A free - body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body .	1	physics
 2659 . What do we mean by an external force ?	0	physics
 An intuitive notion of external is correct — an external force acts from outside the system of interest .	1	physics
 For example , in [ link](a ) the system of interest is the wagon plus the child in it .	0	physics

 Rockets , airplanes , and cars are pushed forward by a thrust reaction force .	0	physics
 2668 . In Earth ’s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite , or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newton ’s first law ( the law of inertia ) .	1	physics
 An inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and , equivalently , one in which Newton ’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter . Earth ’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame .	0	physics
 You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newton ’s laws , such as the effect just described .	0	physics
 2671 . If a bulldozer pushes a car into a wall , the car will not move but it will noticeably change shape .	0	physics
 A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation .	1	physics

 For example , the length of a race , which is a physical quantity , can be expressed in units of meters ( for sprinters ) or kilometers ( for distance runners ) .	0	physics
 2683 . ( Note that electric current will not be introduced until much later in this text . )	0	physics
 All other physical quantities , such as force and electric charge , can be expressed as algebraic combinations of length , mass , time , and current ( for example , speed is length divided by time ) ; these units are called derived units .	1	physics
 2686 . The SI unit for mass is the kilogram ( abbreviated kg ) ; it is defined to be the mass of a platinum - iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris .	1	physics
 Exact replicas of the standard kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology , or NIST , located in Gaithersburg , Maryland outside of Washington D.C. , and at other locations around the world .	0	physics

 Physics as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century is called classical physics .	1	physics
 It was transformed into modern physics by revolutionary discoveries made starting at the beginning of the 20th century .	0	physics
 2698 . Relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about 1 % of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the Sun .	1	physics
 Quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope .	1	physics
 The combination of these two theories is relativistic quantum mechanics , and it describes the behavior of small objects traveling at high speeds or experiencing a strong gravitational field .	1	physics
 2701 . Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity .	1	physics
 For example , suppose the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of −3.0 m / s ( the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane ) .	0	physics
 2704 . The accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up .	0	physics
 The greater the acceleration , the greater the change in velocity over a given time .	0	physics
 The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions , but more inclusive .	0	physics
 2707 . Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air , while friction between objects — such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped — also opposes motion between them .	1	physics
 For the ideal situations of these first few chapters , an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free - fall .	1	physics

 Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected value .	1	physics
 2716 . On many occasions , physicists , other scientists , and engineers need to make approximations or “ guesstimates ” for a particular quantity .	0	physics
 What is the distance to a certain destination ?	0	physics
 2719 . An arrow used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector ’s magnitude ( e.g. , the larger the magnitude , the longer the length of the vector ) and points in the same direction as the vector . Some physical quantities , like distance , either have no direction or none is specified .	1	physics
 A scalar is any quantity that has a magnitude , but no direction .	1	physics
 For example , a 20ºC20ºC temperature , the 250 kilocalories ( 250 Calories ) of energy in a candy bar , a 90 km / h speed limit , a person ’s 1.8 m height , and a distance of 2.0 m are all scalars — quantities with no specified direction .	0	physics
 2722 . The head - to - tail method is a graphical way to add vectors , described in [ link ] below and in the steps following .	1	physics
 The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector , and the head ( or tip ) of a vector is the final , pointed end of the arrow .

 In most cases , this involves determining the perpendicular components of a single vector , for example the x- and y - components , or the north - south and east - west components .	0	physics
 2731 . The study of motion is kinematics , but kinematics only describes the way objects move — their velocity and their acceleration .	1	physics
 Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems .	1	physics
 Newton ’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics .	0	physics
 2734 . The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia .	1	physics
 Newton ’s first law is often called the law of inertia .	0	physics
 2737 . A kilogram of one substance is equal in mass to a kilogram of another substance .	0	physics
 The quantities that might differ between them are volume and density . Section SummaryNewton ’s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest , or , if in motion , remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force .	1	physics

 2767 . Electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations .	1	physics
 Fuels , such as gasoline and food , carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation .	1	physics
 Chemical fuel can also produce electrical energy , such as in batteries .	0	physics
 2770 . Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion .	0	physics
 This internal mechanical energy from the random motions is called thermal energy , because it is related to the temperature of the object .	1	physics
 These and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work .	0	physics
 2773 . Work done by a person is sometimes called useful work , which is work done on the outside world , such as lifting weights .	1	physics

 1527 . The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys .	0	biology
 1530 . In contrast to ADH , which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance , aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules .	1	biology

 1659 . Short bones , or cuboidal bones , are bones that are the same width and length , giving them a cube - like shape .	1	biology
 For example , the bones of the wrist ( carpals ) and ankle ( tarsals ) are short bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1662 . Sesamoid bones are small , flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed .	1	biology
 The patellae are sesamoid bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1665 . Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems .	0	biology
 Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi , which transport blood . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .	1	biology
 1668 . Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones , spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones .	0	biology
 Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .	1	biology
 1671 . Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes .	0	biology
 Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei .	1	biology
 They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix .	0	biology
 1674 . Ossification , or osteogenesis , is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts .	1	biology
 Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification ; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones , it can also occur in other tissues .	0	biology
 1677 . Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone .	0	biology
 Until adolescence , hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate ( growth plate ) , which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1680 . In mammals , pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation ( breathing ) .	0	biology
 During inhalation , air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 As air passes through the nasal cavity , the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified .	0	biology
 1683 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 1686 . Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction ( parasympathetic ) or relaxation ( sympathetic ) in the bronchi and bronchioles , depending on the nervous system ’s cues .	0	biology
 In humans , bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles .	1	biology
 They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 1689 . In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .	0	biology
 At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .	1	biology
 Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli .	0	biology
 1692 . Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases .	1	biology
 The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture .	0	biology
 1695 . On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .	0	biology
 The expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 1698 . Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes .	0	biology
 The vital capacity ( VC ) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1701 . The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 Lastly , the total lung capacity ( TLC ) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the residual volume , expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1704 . In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .	1	biology
 The ratio of these values ( FEV1/FVC ratio ) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma , emphysema , and fibrosis .	0	biology
 If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high , the lungs are not compliant ( meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly ) , and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis .	0	biology
 1707 . The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs .	0	biology
 The lungs are elastic ; therefore , when air fills the lungs , the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs .	0	biology
 These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath .	0	biology
 1710 . The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .	1	biology
 Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .	1	biology
 1713 . There are two types of work conducted during respiration , flow - resistive and elastic work .	0	biology
 Flow - resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung , whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles , chest wall , and diaphragm .	1	biology
 Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow - resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles .	0	biology
 1716 . Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs .	0	biology
 Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance ( how elastic the lung is ) and resistance ( how much obstruction exists in the airways ) .	1	biology
 A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 1719 . Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema , asthma , and pulmonary edema .	0	biology
 In emphysema , which mostly arises from smoking tobacco , the walls of the alveoli are destroyed , decreasing the surface area for gas exchange .	1	biology
 1722 . There are two types of V / Q mismatch .	0	biology
 Both produce dead space , regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue .	1	biology
 Dead spaces can severely impact breathing , because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion .	0	biology
 1725 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .	0	biology
 Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red .	0	biology
 1728 . Increased temperature , such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle , causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced . Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood ’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen - carrying capacity .	0	biology
 In sickle cell anemia , the shape of the red blood cell is crescent - shaped , elongated , and stiffened , reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In this form , red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries .	0	biology
 1731 . Third , the majority of carbon dioxide molecules ( 85 percent ) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system .	0	biology
 In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	1	biology
 1734 . In all vertebrate organisms , as well as some invertebrates , this is a closed - loop system , in which the blood is not free in a cavity .	0	biology
 In a closed circulatory system , blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route , then returns to the heart again , as illustrated in [ link]a .	1	biology
 As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 1737 . As illustrated in [ link]a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two - chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle .	0	biology
 The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	0	biology
 1740 . The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .	1	biology
 In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .	0	biology
 1743 . The blood is more than the proteins , though .	0	biology
 Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma ( the liquid portion , which contains water , proteins , salts , lipids , and glucose ) and the cells ( red and white cells ) and cell fragments called platelets .	1	biology
 Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water , proteins , electrolytes , lipids , and glucose .	0	biology
 1746 . The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum .	1	biology
 Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves .	0	biology
 1749 . The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .	1	biology
 After it is filled , the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries , by - passing the semilunar valve ( or pulmonic valve ) to the lungs for re - oxygenation .	0	biology
 After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries , the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle .	0	biology
 1752 . The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .	0	biology
 The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1755 . The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .	1	biology
 They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .	0	biology
 The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 1758 . The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body ; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle .	0	biology
 The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax .	1	biology
 The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 1761 . The electrical signals and mechanical actions , illustrated in [ link ] , are intimately intertwined .	0	biology
 The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , which is located near the wall of the right atrium .	0	biology
 Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison .	0	biology
 1764 . The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs .	1	biology
 The major arteries diverge into minor arteries , and then smaller vessels called arterioles , to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body .	0	biology
 1767 . The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .	0	biology
 Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .	1	biology
 The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply .	0	biology
 1770 . The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava .	0	biology
 Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells .	1	biology
 The white blood cells remove infectious agents , such as bacteria and viruses , to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream .	0	biology
 1773 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 1776 . An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .	0	biology
 Both electrolytes and non - electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance .	0	biology
 1779 . Thus , one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams .	0	biology
 The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 1782 . When they move to a hypertonic marine environment , these fish start drinking sea water ; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 Most marine invertebrates , on the other hand , may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers ) .	0	biology
 Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration .	0	biology
 1785 . Externally , the kidneys are surrounded by three layers , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 1788 . The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	0	biology
 Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .	0	biology
 The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 1791 . The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .	0	biology
 The tips of the pyramids , called renal papillae , point toward the renal pelvis .	0	biology
 1794 . The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	0	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1797 . Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .	0	biology
 The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 1800 . The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .	0	biology
 Cortical radiate arteries , as the name suggests , radiate out from the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles , and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons .	1	biology
 1803 . The renal corpuscle , located in the renal cortex , is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule , a cup - shaped chamber that surrounds it , called the glomerular or Bowman 's capsule .	1	biology
 1806 . The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	1	biology
 The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids .	1	biology
 1809 . Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .	1	biology
 Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule .	0	biology
 In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	0	biology
 1812 . Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .	0	biology
 Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption .	1	biology
 In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network .	0	biology
 6717 . In the 1910s , Edith Bolling Wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband , President Woodrow Wilson , afflicted by a stroke , in the last years of his presidency .	0	government
 However , as the niece of one president and the wife of another , it was Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more .	0	government
 6726 . While running for the presidency for the first time in 1992 , Bill Clinton frequently touted the experience and capabilities of his wife .	0	government
 There was a lot to brag about .	0	government
 6729 . The president also exercises the power of pardon without conditions .	0	government
 Once used fairly sparingly — apart from Andrew Johnson ’s wholesale pardons of former Confederates during the Reconstruction period — the pardon power has become more visible in recent decades .	0	government
 6732 . These fears mingled with existing anti - Japanese sentiment across the country and created a paranoia that washed over the West Coast like a large wave .	0	government
 In an attempt to calm fears and prevent any real fifth - column actions , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 , which authorized the removal of people from military areas as necessary .	1	government
 When the military dubbed the entire West Coast a military area , it effectively allowed for the removal of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans from their homes .	0	government
 6735 . On the other hand , signing statements are statements issued by a president when agreeing to legislation that indicate how the chief executive will interpret and enforce the legislation in question .	1	government
 Signing statements are less powerful than vetoes , though congressional opponents have complained that they derail legislative intent .	0	government
 6744 . The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .	0	government
 So , for the most part , the Supreme Court is an appeals court , operating under appellate jurisdiction and hearing appeals from the lower courts .	1	government
 The rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of Congress .	0	government
 6750 . In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit . Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .	1	government
 However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .	0	government
 In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it . In an atmosphere of perceived weakness , the first chief justice , John Jay , an author of The Federalist Papers and appointed by President George Washington , resigned his post to become governor of New York and later declined President John Adams ’s offer of a subsequent term .

 6753 . If the courts find an action to be unconstitutional , it becomes null and void .	0	government
 Judicial review was established in the Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison , when , for the first time , the Court declared an act of Congress to be unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) . Wielding this power is a role Marshall defined as the “ very essence of judicial duty , ” and it continues today as one of the most significant aspects of judicial power .	1	government
 Judicial review lies at the core of the court ’s ability to check the other branches of government — and the states .	0	government
 6756 . President Adams had appointed William Marbury to a position in Washington , DC , but his commission was not delivered before Adams left office .	0	government
 So Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to use its power under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president ’s secretary of state , James Madison , to deliver the commission documents .	0	government
 It was a task Madison refused to do .	0	government
 6762 . The federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights .	0	government
 For example , when Samantha Elauf , a Muslim woman , was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company ’s dress code , the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated , making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages .	0	government
 6768 . In a number of cases , they have expressed reluctance to expand rights without limit , and they still balance that expansion with the government ’s need to govern , provide for the common good , and serve a broader societal purpose .	0	government
 For example , the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty , ruling that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider “ retribution and the possibility of deterrence ” when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it . Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153 ( 1976 ) .	1	government
 In other words , there is a greater good — more safety and security — that may be more important than sparing the life of an individual who has committed a heinous crime .	0	government
 6771 . Courts hear two different types of disputes : criminal and civil .	0	government
 Under criminal law , governments establish rules and punishments ; laws define conduct that is prohibited because it can harm others and impose punishment for committing such an act .	0	government
 Crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness ; felonies are the more serious crimes .	1	government
 6774 . The federal courts , on the other hand , will hear any case that involves a foreign government , patent or copyright infringement , Native American rights , maritime law , bankruptcy , or a controversy between two or more states .	1	government
 Cases arising from activities across state lines ( interstate commerce ) are also subject to federal court jurisdiction , as are cases in which the United States is a party .	0	government
 6780 . There are ninety - four U.S. district courts in the fifty states and U.S. territories , of which eighty - nine are in the states ( at least one in each state ) .	0	government
 The others are in Washington , DC ; Puerto Rico ; Guam ; the U.S. Virgin Islands ; and the Northern Mariana Islands .	0	government
 6783 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .	0	government
 Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .	1	government
 Beginning in 1789 when there were just thirteen , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system .	0	government
 6786 . The U.S. court system operates on the principle of stare decisis ( Latin for stand by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and tomorrow ’s rulings rely on what is decided today .	1	government
 Stare decisis is especially important in the U.S. common law system , in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself .	0	government
 6789 . At the federal level , the president nominates a candidate to a judgeship or justice position , and the nominee must be confirmed by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate , a function of the Senate ’s “ advice and consent ” role .	0	government
 All judges and justices in the national courts serve lifetime terms of office .	0	government
 6795 . Since their appointments , both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology .	0	government
 The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 has prompted the most recent discussion of appointing a new justice , with Obama nominating Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat .	0	government
 However , action on this nominee is unlikely given the election of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency .	0	government
 6798 . Sandra Day O’Connor , nominated by Republican president Ronald Reagan , often became a champion for women ’s rights .	0	government
 David Souter , nominated by Republican George H. W. Bush , more often than not sided with the Court ’s liberal wing .	0	government
 And even on the present - day court , Anthony Kennedy , a Reagan appointee , has become notorious as the Court ’s swing vote , sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not .	0	government
 6801 . For better or worse , sometimes it is only a controversial nominee who leaves a president ’s legacy behind .	0	government
 For example , the Reagan presidency is often remembered for two controversial nominees to the Supreme Court — Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg , the former accused of taking an overly conservative and “ extremist view of the Constitution”John M. Broder .	0	government

 While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves , they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators , lawyers , and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system .	0	government
 6810 . With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .	0	government
 Had the Democrats retained the presidency in 2016 , the replacement for Scalia ’s spot on the court could have swung many key votes in a moderate or liberal direction .	0	government
 6813 . The Supreme Court begins its annual session on the first Monday in October and ends late the following June .	0	government

 These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ” This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .	1	government
 Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level .	1	government

 Upon taking office in 1933 during the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) , President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a series of legislative proposals to boost the economy and put people back to work .	0	government
 The enacted programs allowed the federal government to play a broader role in revitalizing the economy while greatly expanding its power .	0	government
 6855 . Johnson declared a “ War on Poverty , ” instituting a package of Great Society programs designed to improve circumstances for lower - income Americans across the nation .	1	government
 The new programs included Medicare and Medicaid , which are health insurance programs for seniors and low - income citizens respectively , and the food stamp program , which provides food assistance to low - income families .	0	government
 These initiatives greatly expanded the role of the federal government in providing a social safety net .

 She signed a bill into law that makes voter registration automatic for all citizens in the state with a driver ’s license .	0	government
 6867 . Given their focus on pursuing individual objectives , states with an individualistic mindset will tend to advance tax breaks as a way of trying to boost a state ’s economy or as a mechanism for promoting individual initiative and entrepreneurship .	0	government
 For instance , New Jersey governor Chris Christie made headlines in 2015 when discussing the incentives he used to attract businesses to the state .	0	government
 Christie encouraged a number of businesses to move to Camden , where unemployment has risen to almost 14 percent , by providing them with hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks .

 The original theory rested on the assumption that new cultures could arise with the influx of settlers from different parts of the world ; however , since immigration patterns have changed over time , it could be argued that the three cultures no longer match the country ’s current reality .	1	government
 6879 . As an example of the Frankenstein veto , when an appropriations bill was sent to Wisconsin governor James E. Doyle for signature in 2005 , Doyle scrapped over seven hundred words from a passage that would have appropriated millions of dollars to transportation .	0	government
 The words that remained in the bill redirected those funds to education .	0	government
 6882 . For example , Texas governor Greg Abbott made headlines in 2015 for writing to the CEO of General Electric ( GE ) , urging the company to relocate its corporate headquarters from Connecticut , which had just raised its corporate tax rate , to Texas .

 A delegate legislator represents the will of those who elected him or her to office and acts in their expressed interest , even when it goes against personal belief about what is ultimately in the constituency ’s best interest .	1	government
 On the other hand , trustees believe they were elected to exercise their own judgment and know best because they have the time and expertise to study and understand an issue .	0	government

 Thus , increased diversity in state legislatures can have consequences for voter engagement and for the type of legislation pursued and passed within these bodies .	0	government
 6897 . Under consecutive term limits , a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate , most commonly eight years .	0	government
 To try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met , the member will have to wait to run for office again .	0	government
 6900 . Interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization .	0	government
 This same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials . See note above .	0	government
 This presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature ’s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions , such as oversight .	0	government
 6909 . The activities by which government achieves these functions include — but are not limited to — taxation , homeland security , immigration , foreign affairs , and education .	0	government
 The more society grows and the need for government services expands , the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes .	0	government
 Public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations .	0	government
 6912 . Under President George Washington , the bureaucracy remained small enough to accomplish only the necessary tasks at hand . For the early origins of the U.S. bureaucracy see Michael Nelson .	0	government
 1982 . 6918 .	0	government
 With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 , the United States faced record levels of unemployment and the associated fall into poverty , food shortages , and general desperation .	0	government
 When the Republican president and Congress were not seen as moving aggressively enough to fix the situation , the Democrats won the 1932 election in overwhelming fashion .	0	government
 6924 . While the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century , it also underwent a very different evolution .	0	government
 Beginning with the Pendleton Act in the 1880s , the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system .	0	government
 The distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial .	0	government
 6930 . The classic model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal Weberian model , and it was developed by Max Weber , an early German sociologist .	0	government
 Weber argued that the increasing complexity of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services .	0	government
 6936 . Elected officials are regularly frustrated when bureaucrats seem not follow the path they intended .	0	government
 As a result , the bureaucratic process becomes inundated with red tape .	0	government
 This is the name for the procedures and rules that must be followed to get something done .	1	government
 6939 . In this photograph , Lois Lerner , the former director of the Internal Revenue Service ’s Exempt Organizations Unit , sits before an oversight committee in Congress following a 2013 investigation .	0	government
 On the advice of her attorney , Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself and refused to answer questions .	0	government
 6945 . The act ’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi - juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints , conducts investigations into possible abuses , and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out . Campbell , “ Civil Service Reform , ” 100 .	1	government
 Over time , Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts .	0	government
 These include the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 , which further compelled federal agencies to protect whistleblowers who reasonably perceive that an institution or the people in the institution are acting inappropriately ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6948 . One approach to thinking about public policy is to see it as the broad strategy government uses to do its job .	1	government
 More formally , it is the relatively stable set of purposive governmental actions that address matters of concern to some part of society . James E. Anderson .	0	government
 6957 . Forests , water , and fisheries , however , are a type of public good called common goods , which are not excludable but may be finite .	1	government
 The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them , no one has a financial interest in protecting their long - term or future value .	0	government
 Without government regulation , a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water , since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else ( see [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6960 . In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .	0	government
 One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .	1	government
 6963 . While distributive policy , according to Lowi , has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits .	1	government
 A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society .	0	government
 6966 . A final type of policy is redistributive policy , so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another .	1	government
 That is , according to Lowi , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits .	0	government
 6972 . After completing a minimum number of years of work , American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age .	0	government
 It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group , and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment .	1	government
 The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings .	0	government
 6975 . Medicaid is a formula - based , health insurance program , which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category .	1	government
 Individuals in the Medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits , although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program ( it pays them less for services than does Medicare ) .	0	government
 6978 . A lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is AARP ( formerly the American Association of Retired Persons ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 AARP ’s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens , often through regulatory or redistributive politics .	1	government
 6981 . The policy process contains four sequential stages : ( 1 ) agenda setting , ( 2 ) policy enactment , ( 3 ) policy implementation , and ( 4 ) evaluation .	1	government
 Given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government , called the continuing agenda , and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time , it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process . Agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process .	0	government
 1989 . 6987 .	0	government
 Roosevelt sought to implement a new approach to economic regulation known as Keynesianism .	0	government
 Named for its developer , the economist John Maynard Keynes , Keynesian economics argues that it is possible for a recession to become so deep , and last for so long , that the typical models of economic collapse and recovery may not work .	1	government
 Keynes suggested that economic growth was closely tied to the ability of individuals to consume goods .	0	government
 6990 . Portions of the budget not devoted to mandatory spending are categorized as discretionary spending because Congress must pass legislation to authorize money to be spent each year .	0	government
 About 50 percent of the approximately $ 1.2 trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government , including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings .	0	government
 6993 . As you would expect , Keynesians and supply - siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best .	0	government
 Keynesians , with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand , prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer ’s income increases .	0	government
 This policy leaves those most likely to spend their money with more money to spend .	0	government
 6996 . Financial panics arise when too many people , worried about the solvency of their investments , try to withdraw their money at the same time .	0	government
 Such panics plagued U.S. banks until 1913 ( [ link ] ) , when Congress enacted the Federal Reserve Act .	0	government
 The act established the Federal Reserve System , also known as the Fed , as the central bank of the United States .	1	government
 7002 . If the European continent was stable , so too was the world .	0	government
 During the Cold War era that followed World War II , stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable .	0	government
 Until approximately 1989–1990 , advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers .	0	government
 7005 . One of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world - level authority exists to mandate when and how the world ’s nations interact .	0	government
 After the failed attempt by President Woodrow Wilson and others to formalize a “ League of Nations ” in the wake of World War I in the 1920s , and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in 1929 , came World War II , history ’s deadliest military conflict .	0	government
 Now , in the early decades of the twenty - first century , it is common to think of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as the big game - changer .	0	government
 7011 . The balance of trade is the relationship between a country ’s inflow and outflow of goods .	1	government
 The United States sells many goods and services around the world , but overall it maintains a trade deficit , in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas .	1	government
 7014 . At the more serious end of the foreign policy decision - making spectrum , and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails , the U.S. military and defense establishment exists to provide the United States the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors .	0	government
 Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .	0	government
 Or it can be defensive , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , also known as Operation Desert Storm ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 7018 . The European Union is the single supranational entity with some real and significant authority over its member nations .	1	government
 Adoption of its common currency , the euro , brings with it concessions from countries on a variety of matters , and the EU ’s economic and environmental regulations are the strictest in the world .	0	government
 7021 . Many statutes affect what the government can do in the foreign policy realm , including the National Security Act , the Patriot Act , the Homeland Security Act , and the War Powers Resolution .	0	government
 The National Security Act governs the way the government shares and stores information , while the Patriot Act ( passed immediately after 9/11 ) clarifies what the government may do in collecting information about people in the name of protecting the country .	1	government

 Executive agreements are negotiated by the president , and in the case of sole executive agreements , they are simultaneously approved by the president as well .	1	government
 On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .	1	government

 This dual domestic and international role has been described by the two presidencies thesis .	0	government
 This theory originated with University of California – Berkeley professor Aaron Wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies , one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy , and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy .	0	government

 A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches .	0	biology
 44 . Another field of biological study , neurobiology , studies the biology of the nervous system , and although it is considered a branch of biology , it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience .	1	biology
 Because of its interdisciplinary nature , this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular , cellular , developmental , medical , and computational approaches .	0	biology
 50 . An atom is composed of two regions : the nucleus , which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons , and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Atoms contain protons , electrons , and neutrons , among other subatomic particles .	0	biology
 53 . Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons .	0	biology
 The number of protons determines an element ’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .	1	biology
 The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .	0	biology
 56 . IsotopesIsotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons .	1	biology

 Elements also have specific chemical reactivity , the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other .	1	biology
 62 . The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons .	0	biology
 This is known as the octet rule , which states , with the exception of the innermost shell , that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell , the outermost electron shell .	1	biology
 Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 68 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	1	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	0	biology
 71 . Even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules ( each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom ) , in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds : they contain atoms of more than one type of element .	1	biology
 Molecular oxygen , on the other hand , as shown in [ link],consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule . The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond .	0	biology
 74 . In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .	1	biology
 This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs — a state called equilibrium .	1	biology
 These situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products .	0	biology
 77 . Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .	1	biology
 Anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in “ -ide ” : the anion of chlorine is called chloride , and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide , for example .	0	biology
 80 . Certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes ( including sodium , potassium , and calcium ) , ions necessary for nerve impulse conduction , muscle contractions and water balance .	1	biology
 Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise .	0	biology
 83 . This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’s electrons .	0	biology
 Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively .	0	biology
 Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus .	0	biology
 86 . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination .	0	biology
 Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules .	1	biology

 Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids .	0	biology
 Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 92 . Eventually , as water reaches its boiling point of 100 ° Celsius ( 212 ° Fahrenheit ) , the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules , and the kinetic energy ( motion ) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas .	0	biology
 Even when below its boiling point , water ’s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize : this process is known as evaporation .	1	biology
 95 . Before it overflows , the water forms a dome - like shape above the rim of the glass .	0	biology
 This water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion .	0	biology
 In cohesion , water molecules are attracted to each other ( because of hydrogen bonding ) , keeping the molecules together at the liquid - gas ( water - air ) interface , although there is no more room in the glass .	1	biology
 98 . This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it .	1	biology
 This type of adhesion is called capillary action , and is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology

 The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .	1	biology
 The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .	0	biology
 1916 . In both sexes , the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland .	1	biology
 When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .	0	biology
 1922 . In addition , estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles .	0	biology
 Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth , ovulation , and calcium absorption ; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females .	1	biology
 These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .	0	biology
 1925 . Just prior to the middle of the cycle ( approximately day 14 ) , the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly , then fall .	0	biology
 The spike in LH causes ovulation : the most mature follicle , like that shown in [ link ] , ruptures and releases its egg .	1	biology
 The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost .	0	biology
 1928 . In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 In placental mammals , the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane , as illustrated in [ link]b .	1	biology
 1931 . In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .	0	biology
 Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .	0	biology
 1934 . Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual .	1	biology
 The length of time of gestation varies among animals , but is very similar among the great apes : human gestation is 266 days , while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days , a gorilla ’s is 257 days , and orangutan gestation is 260 days long .	0	biology
 The fox has a 57-day gestation .	0	biology
 1937 . The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control .	1	biology
 Strictly speaking , contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining .	0	biology
 Both terms are , however , frequently used interchangeably .	0	biology
 1940 . The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 In further development , the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord .	0	biology
 1943 . A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time .	1	biology
 ( Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics . )	1	biology
 A population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries : natural boundaries might be rivers , mountains , or deserts , while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass , manmade structures , or roads .	0	biology
 1946 . Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere .	0	biology
 The abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes : large areas of land with similar climate , flora , and fauna .	0	biology
 1955 . There is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low aboveground biomass .	0	biology
 The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost .	1	biology
 The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter , which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter .	0	biology
 1958 . The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .	1	biology
 1961 . The neritic zone ( [ link ] ) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m ( or 650 ft ) at the edge of the continental shelf .	1	biology
 Since light can penetrate this depth , photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone .	0	biology
 1964 . The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone , which is at depths of 4000 m or greater .	1	biology
 The abyssal zone ( [ link ] ) is very cold and has very high pressure , high oxygen content , and low nutrient content .	0	biology
 1970 . Because of this , they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds .	0	biology
 When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus ( from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms , for example ) , the growth of algae skyrockets , resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom .	1	biology
 Algal blooms ( [ link ] ) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water .	0	biology
 1973 . Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth .	1	biology
 Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves , stems , and flowers extending above the water ’s surface .	1	biology
 There are several types of wetlands including marshes , swamps , bogs , mudflats , and salt marshes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1976 . Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder - than - average temperatures that occurred on one day .	0	biology
 In contrast , weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time .	1	biology
 Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles .	0	biology
 1979 . This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide .	0	biology
 This led to haze - effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze - effect cooling usually extends for one or more years .	1	biology
 In Europe and North America , haze - effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784 .	0	biology
 1982 . Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates .	0	biology
 Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean .	1	biology
 When water warms , these chunks of ice melt and methane is released .	0	biology
 1985 . The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist , and how closely associated they are with each other .	0	biology
 Within a particular habitat , a population can be characterized by its population size ( N ) , the total number of individuals , and its population density , the number of individuals within a specific area or volume .	0	biology
 Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations .	0	biology
 1988 . In addition to measuring simple density , further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals .	0	biology
 Species dispersion patterns ( or distribution patterns ) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time .	1	biology
 In other words , they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart , and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart .	0	biology
 1994 . Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 Therefore , when calculating the growth rate of a population , the death rate ( D ) ( number organisms that die during a particular time interval ) is subtracted from the birth rate ( B ) ( number organisms that are born during that interval ) .	1	biology
 This is shown in the following formula :	0	biology
 1997 . The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits ( which we know now are transferred by genes ) to the next generation at a greater rate ( natural selection ) .	1	biology
 To model the reality of limited resources , population ecologists developed the logistic growth model .	0	biology
 2000 . In the real world , phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others .	0	biology
 The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition ( intra- = “ within ” ; -specific = “ species ” ) .	1	biology
 Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity — resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need .	0	biology
 2006 . In Müllerian mimicry , multiple species share the same warning coloration , but all of them actually have defenses .	1	biology
 [ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .	0	biology
 2009 . SymbiosisSymbiotic relationships , or symbioses ( plural ) , are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations .	1	biology
 Most scientists accept this definition , but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic , where both individuals benefit from the interaction .	0	biology
 2012 . A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .	1	biology
 In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .	0	biology
 2015 . The area in question could be a habitat , a biome , or the entire biosphere .	0	biology
 Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome .	1	biology
 Species richness varies across the globe ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2018 . Keystone SpeciesA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community ’s structure .	1	biology
 The intertidal sea star , Pisaster ochraceus , of the northwestern United States is a keystone species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2021 . On the Big Island , approximately 32 acres of land is added each year .	0	biology
 First , weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements , known as pioneer species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other , less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species .	0	biology
 2024 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .	0	biology
 2027 . Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli .	0	biology
 The simplest example of this is a reflex action , an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus .	1	biology
 To test the “ knee - jerk ” reflex , a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer .	0	biology
 2030 . A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed , the pattern goes on to completion .	1	biology
 An example of such a behavior occurs in the three - spined stickleback , a small freshwater fish ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2033 . Communication within a SpeciesAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals .	1	biology
 An example of this is seen in the three - spined stickleback , where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate .	0	biology
 2036 . Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish .	0	biology
 They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young .	1	biology
 2039 . In monogamous systems , one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season .	1	biology
 In some animals , such as the gray wolf , these associations can last much longer , even a lifetime .	0	biology
 2042 . Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure .	1	biology
 This is a form of non - associative learning , as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward .	0	biology
 2045 . In classical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with , the conditioned stimulus .	1	biology
 The response to the original , unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response .	1	biology
 2048 . A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime , such as how resources are allocated for growth , maintenance , and reproduction .	1	biology
 Life history traits affect the life table of an organism .	0	biology
 2051 . Single versus Multiple Reproductive EventsSome life history traits , such as fecundity , timing of reproduction , and parental care , can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species .	0	biology
 Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies .	1	biology
 Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event , sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive .	0	biology
 2054 . Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways .	0	biology
 These are grouped into density - dependent factors , in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality , and density - independent factors , which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density .	1	biology
 Note that in the former , the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset .	0	biology
 2057 . Furthermore , the theory ignored the age - specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important .	0	biology
 New demographic - based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and K - selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors .	0	biology
 2060 . In ecology , two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and resilience .	0	biology
 The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .	1	biology
 The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .	1	biology
 2063 . There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level .	1	biology
 Depending on their role as producers or consumers , species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels .	0	biology
 2066 . The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 2069 . A holistic model — which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment — is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems .	1	biology
 A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic , non - linear web of primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2072 . The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment ( disturbances ) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics .	1	biology
 Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies .	0	biology
 2075 . Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management : a conceptual model , an analytical model , and a simulation model .	0	biology
 A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem .	1	biology
 A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem ; however , its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited .	0	biology
 2078 . Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available , such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy .	0	biology
 2081 . In this ecosystem , the total energy accumulated by the primary producers ( gross primary productivity ) was shown to be 20,810 kcal / m2/yr . Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions ( like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss ) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem .	0	biology
 Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss .	1	biology
 The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level .	0	biology
 2084 . Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level .	1	biology
 Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .	1	biology
 Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food .	1	biology
 2087 . Geologic processes , such as weathering , erosion , water drainage , and the subduction of the continental plates , all play a role in this recycling of materials .	0	biology
 Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process , the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle .	1	biology
 2090 . Fossil fuels are considered a non - renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation .	0	biology
 A non - renewable resource , such as fossil fuel , is either regenerated very slowly or not at all .	1	biology
 Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .	0	biology
 2093 . A dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna ; these zones can be caused by eutrophication , oil spills , dumping of toxic chemicals , and other human activities .	1	biology
 The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years , and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008 .	0	biology
 2096 . Traditionally , ecologists have measured biodiversity , a general term for the variety present in the biosphere , by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness .	1	biology
 Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things .	0	biology
 2099 . Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts .	0	biology
 Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species .	1	biology
 2102 . All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria ; therefore , the 500 species of cichlids were endemic .	0	biology
 Endemic species are found in only one location .	1	biology
 Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction .	0	biology
 2105 . The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions , and a recent one .	0	biology
 It is well known that the North American , and to some degree Eurasian , megafauna , or large animals , disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period .	0	biology
 The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000–12,000 years ago .	0	biology
 2108 . Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area .	0	biology
 Most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as medication .	1	biology
 For centuries in Europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals — books that identified plants and their uses .	0	biology
 2111 . Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve .	1	biology
 Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena .	0	biology
 6110 . Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .	0	government
 In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .	1	government
 However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .	0	government
 In particular , the concept of “ contemporary community standards ” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place ; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive .	0	government
 6113 . Free expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials .	0	government
 This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent , such as American Nazis and the vehemently anti - gay Westboro Baptist Church , whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror ( [ link]).National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie , 432 U.S. 43 ( 1977 ) ; Snyder v. Phelps , 562 U.S. 443 ( 2011 ) .	0	government
 Free expression — although a broad right — is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order .	0	government
 In particular , the nature , place , and timing of protests — but not their substantive content — are subject to reasonable limits .	0	government
 6116 . In the meantime , as part of their black codes designed to reintroduce most of the trappings of slavery , several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves .	0	government
 Despite acknowledging a common - law individual right to keep and bear arms , in 1876 the Supreme Court declined , in United States v. Cruickshank , to intervene to ensure the states would respect it . United States v. Cruickshank , 92 U.S. 542 ( 1876 ) .	0	government
 6119 . v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .	0	government
 Because the District of Columbia is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments .	0	government
 Two years later , in McDonald v. Chicago , the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision ( 5–4 ) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states , meaning that state regulation of firearms might , in some circumstances , be unconstitutional .	1	government
 In 2015 , however , the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco ’s strict gun control laws to remain in place , suggesting that — as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment — the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute ( [ link]).Richard Gonzales , “ Supreme Court Rejects NRA Challenge to San Francisco Gun Rules , ” National Public Radio , 8 June 2015 . http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412917394/supreme-court-rejects-nra-challenge-to-s-f-gun-rules ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6122 . In either case , the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure ; this warrant is a legal document , signed by a judge , allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property .	0	government
 Since the 1960s , however , the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person can be said to lack a “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” outside the home .	0	government
 6125 . In addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals , the Bill of Rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment .	0	government
 The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising .	0	government
 6128 . The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for violating federal law , even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action .	0	government
 For example , in the early 1990s , several Los Angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist Rodney King during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court , but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating King ’s civil rights .	0	government
 6131 . The final provision of the Fifth Amendment has little to do with crime at all .	0	government
 The takings clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation . ” This provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit .	0	government
 For example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as clothing , housing , education , or food .	0	government
 6134 . Once someone has been charged with a crime and indicted , the next stage in a criminal case is typically the trial itself , unless a plea bargain is reached .	0	government
 The Sixth Amendment contains the provisions that govern criminal trials ; in full , it states :	1	government
 6137 . The Seventh Amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes ; as noted earlier , these are disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused .	1	government
 For example , in an automobile accident , the person responsible is compelled to compensate any others ( either directly or through his or her insurance company ) .	0	government
 6140 . At the same time , however , it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty , perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime .	0	government
 The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed . Elizabeth Lopatto , “ How Many Innocent People Are Sentenced To Death ? , ” Forbes , 29 April 2014 . http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethlopatto/2014/04/29/how-many-innocent-people-are-sentenced-to-death/#6e9ae5175cc1 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 For example , Claude Jones was executed for murder based on 1990-era DNA testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his ; however , with better DNA testing technology , it was later found to be that of the victim . Dave Mann , “ DNA Tests Undermine Evidence in Texas Execution : New Results Show Claude Jones was Put to Death on Flawed Evidence , ” Texas Observer , 11 November 2010 . http://www.texasobserver.org/texas-observer-exclusive-dna-tests-undermine-evidence-in-texas-execution/ ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .	0	government
 As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death . See , for example , “ States With and Without the Death Penalty , ” Death Penalty Information Center , http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .	0	government
 6143 . We saw above that James Madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the Constitution and omitted others .	0	government
 To ensure that those interpreting the Constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the Bill of Rights was not exhaustive , the Ninth Amendment states :	0	government
 6146 . Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights , scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common - law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century : a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life , particularly within the bounds of the home .	1	government
 For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) .	0	government
 6149 . Starting in the 1980s , Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents began to roll back the Roe decision .	0	government
 A key turning point was the court ’s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 , in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe ’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test , which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “ substantial obstacle[s ] ” ( undue burdens ) to women seeking an abortion . Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 ( 1992 ) .	1	government
 Thus , the court upheld some state restrictions , including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion , parental consent ( or , if not possible for some reason such as incest , authorization of a judge ) for minors , and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion .	0	government
 Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden .	0	government
 6152 . In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .	0	government
 Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .	0	government
 Most European countries , at least on paper , have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance , perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes .	0	government
 6155 . Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise , the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed .	0	government
 In these cases , the courts are applying the rational basis test .	0	government
 That is , as long as there ’s a reason for treating some people differently that is “ rationally related to a legitimate government interest , ” the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable . Cornell University Law School : Legal Information Institute .	1	government

 Under strict scrutiny , the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group — the law or action can be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve the goal in question , and that it is the “ least restrictive means ” available to achieve that goal .

 In 1962 , Congress proposed what later became the Twenty - Fourth Amendment , which banned the poll tax in elections to federal ( but not state or local ) office ; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964 .	1	government
 Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when , in the case of Harper v.

Newer , grassroots organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , and Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) challenged the NAACP ’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal - focused strategy .	0	government
 These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .	0	government
 The strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , or the refusal to obey an unjust law , had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma Gandhi to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s .	0	government

Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v. Virginia).Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) .	1	government
 While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated .	0	government
 In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E.

 Shortly after , the Tillman Act ( 1907 ) was passed by Congress , which prohibited corporations from contributing money to candidates running in federal elections .	1	government
 Other congressional acts followed , limiting how much money individuals could contribute to candidates , how candidates could spend contributions , and what information would be disclosed to the public . Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 ; Hatch Act of 1939 ; Taft - Hartley Act of 1947	0	government
 6362 . By using loopholes in the laws , political parties and political action committees donated large sums of money to candidates , and new reforms were soon needed .	0	government
 Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russ Feingold ( former D - WI ) cosponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain – Feingold Act .	0	government
 McCain – Feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties , which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence .	1	government
 6365 . The court ruling also allowed corporations to place unlimited money into super PACs , or Independent Expenditure - Only Committees .	0	government
 These organizations can not contribute directly to a candidate , nor can they strategize with a candidate ’s campaign .	0	government
 6368 . Senator or House member , some states use the top - two primary method .	0	government
 A top - two primary , sometimes called a jungle primary , pits all candidates against each other , regardless of party affiliation .	1	government
 The two candidates with the most votes become the final candidates for the general election .	0	government
 6371 . It was , however , one of the worst occurrences .	0	government
 States have been frontloading since the 1976 presidential election , with the problem becoming more severe in the 1992 election and later . Josh Putnam , “ Presidential Primaries and Caucuses by Month ( 1976 ) , ” Frontloading HQ ( blog ) , February 3 , 2009 , http://frontloading.blogspot.com/2009/02/1976-presidential-primary-calendar.html .	0	government
 6374 . The general election campaign period occurs between mid - August and early November .	0	government
 These elections are simpler than primaries and conventions , because there are only two major party candidates and a few minor party candidates .	0	government
 6377 . In forty - eight states and the District of Columbia , the candidate who wins the most votes in November receives all the state ’s electoral votes , and only the electors from that party will vote .	1	government
 This is often called the winner - take - all system .	0	government
 In two states , Nebraska and Maine , the electoral votes are divided .	0	government
 6380 . During a presidential election year , members of Congress often experience the coattail effect , which gives members of a popular presidential candidate ’s party an increase in popularity and raises their odds of retaining office .	1	government
 During a midterm election year , however , the president ’s party often is blamed for the president ’s actions or inaction .	0	government
 6383 . There are more candidates vying to become their party ’s nominee , and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one .	0	government
 In the 2016 presidential election , Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options , including Mike Huckabee , Donald Trump , Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , John Kasich , Chris Christie , Carly Fiorina , Ben Carson , and more .	0	government
 ( Huckabee , Christie , and Fiorina dropped out relatively early . )	0	government
 6386 . Another source of negative ads is from groups outside the campaigns .	0	government
 Sometimes , shadow campaigns , run by political action committees and other organizations without the coordination or guidance of candidates , also use negative ads to reach voters .	0	government
 Even before the Citizens United decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates , shadow campaigns existed .	0	government
 6389 . Over time , however , ads became more negative and manipulative .	0	government
 In reaction , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , or McCain – Feingold , included a requirement that candidates stand by their ad and include a recorded statement within the ad stating that they approved the message .	0	government
 Although ads , especially those run by super PACs , continue to be negative , candidates can no longer dodge responsibility for them .	0	government
 6392 . In essence , this is retrospective voting , but it requires little of the voter .	0	government
 In congressional and local elections , incumbents win reelection up to 90 percent of the time , a result called the incumbency advantage .	1	government
 What contributes to this advantage and often persuades competent challengers not to run ?	0	government
 6395 . Finally , the recall is one of the more unusual forms of direct democracy ; it allows voters to decide whether to remove a government official from office .	1	government
 All states have ways to remove officials , but removal by voters is less common .	0	government
 6398 . First , while citizens of these states believe smoking or consuming marijuana should be legal , the U.S. government does not .	0	government
 The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , passed by Congress in 1970 , declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act .	1	government

 Public relations is not a neutral information form .	0	government
 6407 . Walter Cronkite , reporting from Vietnam , had a loyal following .	0	government
 In a broadcast following the Tet Offensive in 1968 , Cronkite expressed concern that the United States was mired in a conflict that would end in a stalemate.“Walter Cronkite ’s ‘ We Are Mired in Stalemate’ Broadcast , February 27 , 1968 ” Digital History , http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/vietnam/cronkite.cfm ( November 29 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 His coverage was based on opinion after viewing the war from the ground . Joel Achenbach , “ Cronkite and Vietnam , ” Washington Post , 18 May 2012 .	0	government
 Although the number of people supporting the war had dwindled by this time , Cronkite ’s commentary bolstered opposition .	0	government
 5224 . Now , let ’s look at what happens with protectionism .	0	economic
 U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that , if only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil , the United States would have higher domestic sugar production , more jobs in the sugar industry , and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price .	0	economic
 5227 . While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , from spring 2008 to late 2009 , the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % to 10 % ; it has since fallen back to 5.5 % in spring 2015—the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time .	0	economic
 The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for two reasons , it costs jobs in other unprotected industries .	0	economic
 First , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries .	0	economic
 5230 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .	0	economic
 After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .	0	economic
 Meanwhile , low - skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing .	0	economic
 5233 . Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .	1	economic
 Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .	1	economic
 5236 . If free trade meant the destruction of life itself , then even economists would convert to protectionism !	0	economic
 While globalization — and economic activity of all kinds — can pose environmental dangers , it seems quite possible that , with the appropriate safeguards in place , the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized .	0	economic
 5239 . The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this .	0	economic
 Profit - seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards , thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits .	0	economic
 5242 . The United Nations was unable to agree to this .	0	economic
 Instead , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade .	1	economic
 In 1995 , the GATT was transformed into the WTO .	0	economic
 5245 . For the United States , perhaps the best - known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .	0	economic
 The United States also participates in some less - prominent regional trading agreements , like the Caribbean Basin Initiative , which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries , and a free trade agreement with Israel .	1	economic
 5248 . What is a function ?	0	economic
 A function describes a relationship .	1	economic
 Sometimes the relationship is a definition .	0	economic
 5251 . The concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between two variables .	1	economic
 A positive slope means that two variables are positively related ; that is , when x increases , so does y , or when x decreases , y decreases also .	1	economic
 Graphically , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises .	0	economic
 5254 . The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs , because they show a relationship between two variables : one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 5257 . A pie graph ( sometimes called a pie chart ) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts .	1	economic
 A circle represents a group as a whole .	0	economic
 5260 . This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .	1	economic
 By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic — the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model . What Is an Indifference Curve ?	0	economic
 5263 . From this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high — so on the margin , it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book .	0	economic
 In short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution — that is , the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods .	1	economic
 5266 . Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations : a substitution effect and an income effect .	0	economic
 The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out substitutes .	1	economic
 If oranges become more expensive , fruit - lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples , grapefruit , or raisins .	0	economic
 5269 . The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen , so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility .	0	economic
 The slope of the budget constraint in a labor - leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate .	0	economic
 Thus , the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set , reflecting the labor - leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate , but tangent to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ” The shift from original choice A to point C , which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line , shows that because of the higher wage , Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income .	0	economic
 5272 . The expenditure - output model , sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram , determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced .	1	economic
 The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending .	0	economic
 5275 . When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium , it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP — because by definition , GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy .	1	economic
 Thus , the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the 45-degree line .	0	economic
 5278 . The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures .	1	economic
 The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .	1	economic
 It must always hold true that :	0	economic
 5281 . Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward - sloping line , with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import ( MPI ) , out of national income .	0	economic
 In [ link ] ( b ) , the marginal propensity to import is 0.1 .	0	economic
 5284 . The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function ( after taxes ) , the investment function , the government spending function , the export function , and the import function .	1	economic
 The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and export expenditures — which do not vary with national income .	0	economic
 5287 . Conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( AE0 ) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP .	0	economic
 The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap .	1	economic
 The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting .	0	economic
 5290 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .	0	economic
 One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .	1	economic
 Conversely , if a situation is inefficient , it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others . Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved .	1	economic
 5293 . Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $ 45 , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ 80 , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product .	0	economic
 The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .	1	economic
 In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .	1	economic
 7019 . So the domestic and foreign policy realms are intertwined in terms of what we view as national priorities — whether they consist of nation building abroad or infrastructure building here at home , for example .	0	government

 Executive agreements are negotiated by the president , and in the case of sole executive agreements , they are simultaneously approved by the president as well .	1	government
 On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .	1	government
 In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law . United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .	1	government
 Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .	0	government
 7028 . Should new international agreements into which the United States enters be forged through the Article II treaty process of the U.S. Constitution , or through executive agreements ?	0	government
 This question arose again in 2015 as the Iran Nuclear Agreement was being completed .	0	government
 That pact required Iran to halt further nuclear development and agree to nuclear inspections , while the United States and five other signatories lifted long - standing economic sanctions on Iran .	1	government

 As discussed above , the War Powers Resolution clarified that the first step in the use of force was the president ’s , for the first sixty days .	0	government
 A recent example of the military use of force was the U.S. role in enforcing a no - fly zone over Libya in 2011 , which included kinetic strikes — or active engagement of the enemy — to protect anti - government forces on the ground .	1	government
 7040 . This dual domestic and international role has been described by the two presidencies thesis .	0	government
 This theory originated with University of California – Berkeley professor Aaron Wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies , one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy , and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy .	0	government
 Let ’s look at the reasoning behind this thesis .	0	government
 7043 . While the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers , the governing context has changed in two key ways .	0	government
 First , the Cold War ended in 1989 with the demolition of the Berlin Wall , the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union , and the eventual opening up of Eastern European territories to independence and democracy .	0	government
 These dramatic changes removed the competitive superpower aspect of the Cold War , in which the United States and the USSR were dueling rivals on the world stage .	0	government
 7046 . The White House staff members engaged in foreign policy are likely to have very regular contact with the president about their work .	0	government
 The national security advisor heads the president ’s National Security Council , a group of senior - level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy advisor . Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .	1	government

 Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement , including a vocal senator , Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , who was against the United States continuing to be the military “ policeman ” of the world .	0	government
 7058 . At the other end of the spectrum is liberal internationalism .	0	government
 Liberal internationalism advocates a foreign policy approach in which the United States becomes proactively engaged in world affairs .	1	government
 7061 . Two particular events in foreign policy caused many to change their views about the proper approach to U.S. involvement in world affairs .	0	government
 First , the debacle of U.S. involvement in the civil war in Vietnam in the years leading up to 1973 caused many to rethink the country ’s traditional containment approach to the Cold War .	0	government
 Containment was the U.S. foreign policy goal of limiting the spread of communism .	0	government
 7064 . Foreign markets beckon , tourism helps spur economic development at home and abroad , and global environmental challenges require cross - national conversation .	0	government
 In the twenty - first century , neo - isolationism means distancing the United States from the United Nations and other international organizations that get in the way .	1	government
 The strategy of selective engagement — retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations — is used to protect the national security interests of the United States .	1	government

 1819 . Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system .	0	biology
 The cells in the tubules are called flame cells ( or protonephridia ) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope , as illustrated in [ link]a .	1	biology
 The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface ; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid , allowing for filtration .	0	biology
 1825 . Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water .	0	biology
 Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic .	1	biology

 Urea concentration in the blood , called blood urea nitrogen or BUN , is used as an indicator of kidney function .	1	biology
 1831 . The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts .	1	biology
 A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen .	1	biology
 1834 . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected .	0	biology
 When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’s surface .	0	biology
 PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells .	1	biology
 1840 . The first cytokines to be produced are pro - inflammatory ; that is , they encourage inflammation , the localized redness , swelling , heat , and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection . The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen .	1	biology
 1843 . Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi .	0	biology
 A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens .	1	biology
 A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1846 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .	1	biology
 T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .	0	biology
 1849 . MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens ( “ non - self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes .	0	biology
 MHC II molecules interact with helper T - cells to trigger the appropriate immune response , which may include the inflammatory response . Lymphocytes , such as NK cells , are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope .	1	biology

 1852 . An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins , called a complement system , functions to destroy extracellular pathogens .	1	biology
 Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously ; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms .	0	biology
 1855 . In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized .	0	biology
 There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell - mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies .	0	biology
 Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen .	0	biology
 1858 . Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells .	0	biology
 Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines .	1	biology
 Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen - presenting cell .	0	biology
 1861 . Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .	0	biology
 In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .	0	biology
 The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) .	0	biology
 1864 . Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells : they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts , and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells .	1	biology
 1867 . Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .	0	biology
 Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors .	1	biology
 The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .	0	biology
 1870 . The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) .	1	biology
 Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes .	1	biology
 Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems , which are separated by interstitial space , by a process called extravasation ( passing through to surrounding tissue ) .	0	biology
 1873 . Not all antibodies bind with the same strength , specificity , and stability .	0	biology
 In fact , antibodies exhibit different affinities ( attraction ) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably , and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen .	0	biology
 1876 . Once the afferent arterioles are constricted , blood flow into the nephrons stops .	0	biology
 These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system .	0	biology
 1879 . Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .	1	biology
 Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels .	0	biology
 1882 . The atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator .	1	biology
 It is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea .	0	biology
 1885 . The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody - mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy .	1	biology
 In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens .	0	biology
 1888 . Both methods have advantages and disadvantages .	0	biology
 Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent .	1	biology
 A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly .	0	biology
 1891 . BuddingBudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals .	1	biology
 Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras .	0	biology
 1894 . Hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts .	1	biology
 Invertebrates such as earthworms , slugs , tapeworms and snails , shown in [ link ] , are often hermaphroditic .	0	biology
 1897 . In ovoviparity , fertilized eggs are retained in the female , but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg ’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched .	1	biology
 This occurs in some bony fish ( like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus ) , some sharks , some lizards , some snakes ( such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis ) , some vipers , and some invertebrate animals ( like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa ) .	0	biology
 1900 . Vertebrates have similar structures , with a few differences .	0	biology
 Non - mammals , such as birds and reptiles , have a common body opening , called a cloaca , for the digestive , excretory and reproductive systems .	1	biology
 Coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm .	0	biology
 1903 . Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells , with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen .	0	biology
 1906 . The penis , illustrated in [ link ] , is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse .	1	biology
 The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ .	0	biology
 1909 . The mons pubis is a round , fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis .	1	biology
 The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .	1	biology
 The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .	1	biology
 1912 . Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries , oviducts , the uterus , and the vagina , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments .	0	biology
 1915 . Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells .	1	biology
 The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis .	1	biology
 1918 . At the onset of puberty , the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time .	0	biology
 FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood .	0	biology
 1924 . The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs , while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining .	1	biology
 These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle , with an average length of 28 days .	0	biology
 1927 . To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes , only one sperm must fuse with one egg .	0	biology
 In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 1930 . Cleavage can take place in two ways : holoblastic ( total ) cleavage or meroblastic ( partial ) cleavage .	0	biology
 The type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs .	0	biology
 1936 . During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester , nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion .	0	biology
 As the trimester progresses , the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium , and the placenta forms .	0	biology
 This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus , with the mother ’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it .	1	biology
 1939 . Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise , during further development , to the different organs in the animal body .	1	biology
 This process is called organogenesis .	0	biology
 Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo .	0	biology
 1942 . Ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment .	1	biology
 One core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment .	0	biology
 1945 . Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal , population , and community ecology .	0	biology
 The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components ( living things ) in an area along with the abiotic components ( non - living things ) of that area .	1	biology
 Some of the abiotic components include air , water , and soil .	0	biology
 1954 . Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage .	0	biology
 A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy — the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves .	1	biology
 Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy .	0	biology
 1957 . All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .	1	biology
 The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 1960 . The intertidal zone , which is the zone between high and low tide , is the oceanic region that is closest to land ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Generally , most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach .	0	biology
 1963 . Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .	1	biology
 Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents .	0	biology
 1966 . Watch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) video to see marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms . It is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs .	0	biology
 These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral .	1	biology
 In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores .	0	biology
 1969 . Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water , crop irrigation , sanitation , and industry .	1	biology
 These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services .	0	biology
 Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are , therefore , connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes .	0	biology
 1972 . The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .	0	biology
 The channel ( the width of the river or stream ) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream .	1	biology
 Because of this , the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream .	0	biology
 1975 . Climate refers to the long - term , predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area .	1	biology
 The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges .	0	biology
 1978 . The variation in the sun ’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change .	0	biology
 Solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time .	1	biology
 There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature .	0	biology
 1987 . For mobile organisms , such as mammals , birds , or fish , a technique called mark and recapture is often used .	0	biology
 This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way ( such as tags , bands , paint , or other body markings ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( recaptures ) and some individuals that are unmarked ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1990 . Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time ( usually with data compiled from a life table ) .	1	biology
 These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1993 . After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .	0	biology
 When the population size , N , is plotted over time , a J - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link]).The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited .	0	biology
 Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 1996 . Obviously , a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human .	0	biology
 The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential , or rmax , thus changing the equation to :	0	biology
 2005 . While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration , other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten , even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals .	0	biology
 In Batesian mimicry , a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one .	1	biology
 Assuming they share the same predators , this coloration then protects the harmless ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic .	0	biology
 2008 . All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem , which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community .	1	biology
 The competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat .	1	biology
 In other words , different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources .	0	biology
 2011 . A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism , where two species benefit from their interaction .	1	biology
 Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis .	0	biology
 2020 . Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time .	1	biology
 In primary succession , newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things ; in secondary succession , part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain .	1	biology
 2023 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 2026 . One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning .	1	biology
 Innate behavior , or instinct , is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned .	0	biology
 2029 . A similar , but more directed version of kinesis is taxis : the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus .	1	biology
 This movement can be in response to light ( phototaxis ) , chemical signals ( chemotaxis ) , or gravity ( geotaxis ) and can be directed toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus .	0	biology
 2032 . Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources .	1	biology
 Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors , and these are favored by natural section .	1	biology
 2038 . Significant energy is spent in the process of locating , attracting , and mating with the sex partner .	0	biology
 Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics : intersexual selection , the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex , and intrasexual selection , the competition for mates between species members of the same sex .	1	biology
 Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual , aural , tactile , and chemical cues .	0	biology
 2041 . In polyandrous mating systems , one female mates with many males .	1	biology
 These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems .	0	biology
 2044 . Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning , where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence .	1	biology
 During operant conditioning , the behavioral response is modified by its consequences , with regards to its form , strength , or frequency .	1	biology
 2047 . Some primates , including humans , are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions .	0	biology
 The development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning , the manipulation of information using the mind , the most prominent method of human learning .	1	biology
 In fact , that is how students are learning right now by reading this book .	0	biology
 2050 . Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population .	1	biology
 In other words , fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring .	0	biology
 2053 . Additionally , populations do not usually exist in isolation .	0	biology
 They engage in interspecific competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources .	1	biology
 These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow .	0	biology
 2056 . In contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r designation ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments .	0	biology
 2062 . The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage .	0	biology
 In ecology , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 2068 . Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .	1	biology
 In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in [ link ] , the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain .	0	biology
 2071 . A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .	1	biology
 A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .	1	biology
 These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms .	0	biology
 2077 . An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 Ideally , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers ( such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health .	0	biology
 2086 . One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification .	0	biology
 Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent , toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level , from the primary producers to the apex consumers .	1	biology
 Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate , including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , which was published in the 1960s bestseller , Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson .	0	biology
 2095 . As rain falls through this gas , it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain .	0	biology
 Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas , turning it into weak sulfuric acid , which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems .	1	biology
 Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes , which kills many of the resident fauna ; it also affects the man - made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings .	0	biology
 2098 . The Nile perch was introduced in 1963 , but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge .	0	biology
 The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the disappearance of a species ) .	0	biology
 In fact , there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria : the Nile perch , declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria , and increased fishing pressure .	0	biology
 2101 . It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems .	0	biology
 2104 . In 1988 , British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss : biodiversity hotspots .	0	biology
 Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species .	1	biology
 The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation triage .	0	biology
 2107 . A second approach to estimating present - time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest - area loss and understanding species - area relationships .	0	biology
 The species - area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased .	1	biology
 Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases .	0	biology
 2110 . View a brief video discussing the role of marine ecosystems in supporting human welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems . Bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food .	1	biology
 Hunting is practiced throughout the world , but hunting practices , particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia , are believed to threaten several species with extinction .	0	biology
 4615 . Goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called common resources .	1	economic
 Because the waters of the Caribbean are open to all conch fishermen , and because any conch that you catch is conch that I can not catch , common resources like the conch tend to be overharvested .	0	economic
 4621 . The current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line , although the dollar amounts are adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time .	0	economic
 The U.S. poverty line in 2015 ranged from $ 11,790 for a single individual to $ 25,240 for a household of four people .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows the U.S. poverty rate over time ; that is , the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any given year .	0	economic
 The poverty rate declined through the 1960s , rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s , but seems to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s .	0	economic

 4627 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor . Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .	1	economic
 4633 . SNAP participation increased by 70 % between 2007 and 2011 , from 26.6 million participants to 45 million .	0	economic
 According to the Congressional Budget Office , this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the Great Recession of 2008–2009 and rising food prices . The federal government deploys a range of income security programs that are funded through departments such as Health and Human Services , Agriculture , and Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) ( see [ link ] ) .	0	economic
 According to the Office of Management and Budget , collectively , these three departments provided an estimated $ 62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children , subsidized housing , and energy assistance .	0	economic
 4636 . Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .	0	economic
 We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States . Measuring Income Distribution by QuintilesOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .	1	economic
 4642 . The programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor .	1	economic
 Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .	0	economic
 4645 . The United States does have an estate tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance .	1	economic
 However , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $ 5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth .	0	economic
 4648 . What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ?	0	economic
 To analyze these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor .	0	economic
 If no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( E ) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor ( D ) and the supply of labor ( S ) in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4651 . In the past , presidential use of the Taft - Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but , in this case , it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement . In other instances , unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies .	0	economic
 In one prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor - saving machinery in the mines .	0	economic
 The mineworkers’ union realized that over time , the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines , but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity .	0	economic
 4654 . Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion .	1	economic
 There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which arises if workers with the same skill levels — as measured by education , experience , and expertise — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender .	0	economic
 4657 . If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers .	0	economic
 In a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , hiring , and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors .	0	economic
 4663 . Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns .	0	economic
 Those who express concern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like [ link ] which shows total inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century .	0	economic
 Clearly , the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years , reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century .	0	economic
 4666 . The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed , but often disclosure is not made .	0	economic
 As such , many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information , where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information ( one party knows much more than the other ) .	1	economic
 4669 . For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality .	0	economic
 If there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions .	0	economic
 4672 . When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products , then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity .	0	economic
 Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity .	0	economic
 4675 . In the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back guarantee , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality .	1	economic
 This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail - order catalogs or over the web , whose customers can not see the actual products , because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it .	0	economic
 4678 . Sellers of labor provide information through resumes , recommendations , school transcripts , and examples of their work .	0	economic
 Occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market .	0	economic
 Occupational licenses , which are typically issued by government agencies , show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test .	1	economic
 4681 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4687 . Pension insurance : Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised .	1	economic
 4690 . Retirement insurance : All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly .	1	economic
 Social Security and Medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits .	0	economic
 4693 . Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs .	0	economic
 For example , insurance policies often have deductibles , which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying .	1	economic
 For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 4696 . A final way of reducing moral hazard , which is especially applicable to health care , is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care , rather than consumers .	0	economic
 Traditionally , most health care in the United States has been provided on a fee - for - service basis , which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services .	1	economic

 Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years , or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years , or starts a research and development project .	0	economic
 Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by reinvesting profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( 4 ) by selling stock .	0	economic
 4711 . In this way , an individual investor could , in effect , loan the firm $ 5,000 , or any multiple of that amount .	0	economic
 Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder .	1	economic
 If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .	0	economic
 4714 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .	0	economic
 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	0	economic
 4717 . That rate of return can come in two forms .	0	economic
 A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders , called a dividend .	1	economic
 Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .	0	economic
 4720 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .	0	economic
 A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .	1	economic
 A private company can also be a corporation , but with no publicly issued stock .	0	economic
 4726 . A high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years .	0	economic
 The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time .	1	economic
 4729 . A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades , as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month .	0	economic
 4732 . Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds .	1	economic
 A number of today ’s well - known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft .	0	economic
 4735 . ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )	0	economic
 The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	0	economic
 4738 . [ link ] shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds : 10-year Treasury bonds ( which are officially called “ notes ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody ’s , an independent firm that publishes such ratings .	0	economic
 Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together .	0	economic

 To simplify the process , companies offer mutual funds , which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies .	1	economic
 The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs .	0	economic
 4744 . The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing .	0	economic
 Thus , in attempting to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication .	0	economic
 4750 . For example , many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made — they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it .	0	economic
 In September 2009 , President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff ( taxes added on imported goods ) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year , 30 percent in its second year , and 25 percent in its third year .	1	economic
 Interestingly , the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step , because most of them also import tires from China and other countries .	0	economic
 4753 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic
 They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording .	0	economic
 4759 . Politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district , where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way .	0	economic
 Thus , when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly ask each other to include pork - barrel spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district .	1	economic
 Pork - barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs : the benefits of pork - barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country .	0	economic

 [ link ] breaks down what is produced into five categories : durable goods , nondurable goods , services , structures , and the change in inventories .	0	economic
 Before going into detail about these categories , notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand .	0	economic
 4783 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .	1	economic
 The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .	1	economic
 The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people .	1	economic
 4786 . The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .	1	economic
 The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .	1	economic
 Generally , it is the real value that is more important .	0	economic
 4789 . Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .	0	economic
 However , over time , the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP ( that is , the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line ) , because the rise in nominal GDP is exaggerated by the presence of inflation , especially in the 1970s . U.S .	0	economic

 4798 . So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries , or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ?	0	economic
 This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population .	1	economic
 4801 . GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society .	0	economic
 GDP per capita is only an average .	0	economic
 When GDP per capita rises by 5 % , it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5 % , or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less — or even declined .	0	economic
 4804 . According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .	0	economic
 The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .	1	economic
 Ingenious machines — the steam engine , the power loom , and the steam locomotive — performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do .	0	economic
 4807 . In other words , how efficient is your nation with its time and workers ?	0	economic
 Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input .	1	economic
 The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread .	0	economic
 4810 . To analyze the sources of economic growth , it is useful to think about a production function , which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor , machinery , and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers .	1	economic
 A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .	0	economic
 4813 . It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time .	0	economic
 Similarly , compound rates of economic growth , or the compound growth rate , means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth , with dramatic effects over time .	1	economic
 4816 . It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say , Benin , simply because of the great difference in population size .	0	economic
 To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita .	0	economic
 Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like Belgium , Uruguay , or Zimbabwe , with countries that have larger populations , like the United States , the Russian Federation , or Nigeria .	0	economic
 4819 . Special Economic Zones .	0	economic
 The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government - supported special economic zones ( SEZ ) .	0	economic
 These are areas of the country , usually with access to a port where , among other benefits , the government does not tax trade .	1	economic
 4822 . A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns .	0	economic
 Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita , the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish .	1	economic
 For example , raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth - grade level to a high school diploma ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output .	0	economic
 4825 . An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory .	0	economic
 The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers .	0	economic
 4828 . They are , however , also counted in the employed group .	0	economic
 All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term “ hidden unemployment . ” Discouraged workers , those who have stopped looking for employment and , hence , are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group	1	economic
 4831 . The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy .	0	economic
 During periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high .	0	economic
 During periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower .	0	economic
 4834 . The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( i.e .	1	economic
 the business cycle ) is known as cyclical unemployment .	0	economic
 4837 . One set of reasons why wages may be “ sticky downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions .	0	economic
 For low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages .	0	economic
 For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike .	0	economic
 4840 . Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate .	1	economic
 One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary .	0	economic
 4843 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others .	0	economic
 4846 . But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job .	0	economic
 The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment .	1	economic
 Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing .	0	economic
 4849 . Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy .	1	economic
 Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices .	0	economic
 4852 . To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy .	0	economic
 The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time .	0	economic
 4855 . Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices .	0	economic
 The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 .	0	economic
 4858 . A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption .	0	economic
 Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen .	1	economic
 4861 . The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods .	0	economic
 For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services .	1	economic
 It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 4864 . An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	0	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 Unlike the CPI , its baskets are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s GDP would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices .	0	economic
 4867 . Inflation in China averaged about 10 % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has dropped off since then .	0	economic
 Russia experienced hyperinflation — an outburst of high inflation — of 2,500 % per year in the early 1990s , although by 2006 Russia ’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10 % per year , as shown in [ link ] .	1	economic
 The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War , 1860–1865 , in the Confederate states . Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates , 1980–2013These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in Brazil , China , and Russia .	0	economic
 4870 . Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation .	0	economic
 If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 4873 . Moreover , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful , prolonged conflicts between employers and employees .	0	economic
 If the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently , minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link].U.S .	0	economic
 Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation , the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010 , even though the nominal figure climbed from $ 1.40 to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 4876 . Prices are the messengers in a market economy , conveying information about conditions of demand and supply .	0	economic
 Inflation blurs those price messages .	0	economic
 4879 . Second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible .	0	economic
 The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result .	0	economic
 4882 . In the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost - of - living adjustments ( COLAs ) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation .	1	economic
 These contracts were sometimes written as , for example , COLA plus 3 % .	0	economic
 4885 . Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	0	economic
 This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base . As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing , in 1996 the U.S. , government began offering indexed bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds are means by which the U.S. government ( and many private - sector companies as well ) borrows money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government repays the money with interest .	1	economic
 4888 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic

 The first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP .	0	economic
 The second column shows the trade balance .	0	economic
 4900 . The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments .	0	economic
 Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy .	0	economic
 4903 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ?	0	economic
 4906 . For most years of the nineteenth century , U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit .	0	economic
 Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900 .	0	economic
 4909 . The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade .	0	economic
 The United States has a low level of trade , but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 4912 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic

 Sepals and petals together form the perianth .	1	biology
 The sexual organs ( carpels and stamens ) are located at the center of the flower .	1	biology
 919 . Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .	1	biology
 925 . Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support , especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic .	0	biology
 Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory , or consumption of plants by insects and other animals .	0	biology
 This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination .	0	biology
 931 . In seed plants , the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation , and at the same time , a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte : from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte .	0	biology
 Whereas lower vascular plants , such as club mosses and ferns , are mostly homosporous ( produce only one type of spore ) , all seed plants , or spermatophytes , are heterosporous .	1	biology
 They form two types of spores : megaspores ( female ) and microspores ( male ) .	1	biology

 Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .	0	biology
 949 . More complex animals ( those with bilateral symmetry ) develop three tissue layers : an inner layer ( endoderm ) , an outer layer ( ectoderm ) , and a middle layer ( mesoderm ) .	1	biology
 Animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts .	1	biology
 955 . Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .	0	biology
 These two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first : mouth or anus .	0	biology

 Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	0	biology
 967 . While the validity of this claim is still under investigation , these primitive fossils appear to be small , one - centimeter long , sponge - like creatures .	0	biology
 These fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years , actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 Until this discovery , most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 973 . Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .	0	biology
 Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum .	1	biology
 However , sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms , including variations in the size of the spongocoel , the number of osculi , and where the cells that filter food from the water are located .	0	biology
 976 . The gel - like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges .	0	biology
 In addition to the osculum , sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge .	1	biology
 In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 979 . In some sponges , sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl , which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica , depending on the type of sponge .	0	biology
 These spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge .	0	biology
 982 . Cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes ( “ stinging cells ” ) containing organelles called nematocysts ( stingers ) .	0	biology
 These cells are present around the mouth and tentacles , and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells .	1	biology
 985 . The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .	1	biology
 Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .	0	biology
 In terms of cellular complexity , cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer , such as nerve cells , contractile epithelial cells , enzyme - secreting cells , and nutrient - absorbing cells , as well as the presence of intercellular connections .	0	biology
 988 . The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes .	0	biology
 The slit - like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore .	1	biology
 The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food , and may extend for up to two - thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity .	1	biology
 991 . The rotifers are a microscopic ( about 100 µm to 30 mm ) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona , a rotating , wheel - like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Although their taxonomy is currently in flux , one treatment places the rotifers in three classes : Bdelloidea , Monogononta , and Seisonidea .	0	biology

 It is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks ; there are over 75,000 described species , making them the second most diverse phylum of animals .	0	biology
 1000 . Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally , although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks , such as snails and slugs , or in cephalopods .	0	biology
 In some mollusks , the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages — trochophore and veliger — before becoming a young adult ; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage , glochidia .	0	biology
 1003 . These animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Shells may be planospiral ( like a garden hose wound up ) , commonly seen in garden snails , or conispiral , ( like a spiral staircase ) , commonly seen in marine conches .	0	biology
 1006 . The phylum includes earthworms , polychaete worms , and leeches .	0	biology
 Annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called “ segmented worms ” due to their key characteristic of metamerism , or true segmentation .	1	biology
 1009 . The number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in Oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes ( poly = many , chaetae = hairs ) .	0	biology
 The many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy , flat , paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia , which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates .	1	biology
 The subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as Hirudo medicinalis and Hemiclepsis marginata .	0	biology
 1012 . Tagma may be in the form of a head , thorax , and abdomen , or a cephalothorax and abdomen , or a head and trunk .	0	biology
 A central cavity , called the hemocoel ( or blood cavity ) , is present , and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single - chambered heart .	0	biology
 Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod : insects and myriapods use a series of tubes ( tracheae ) that branch through the body , open to the outside through openings called spiracles , and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae , whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills , terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs , and aquatic chelicerates use book gills ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1015 . Most crustaceans are dioecious , which means that the sexes are separate .	1	biology
 Some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites .	0	biology
 Serial hermaphroditism , where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova , may also be seen in some species .	1	biology
 1018 . A “ head ” tagmum is not usually discernible .	0	biology
 The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages : the chelicerae ( [ link ] ) , which are specialized , claw - like or fang - like mouthparts .	1	biology
 These animals do not possess antennae .	0	biology
 1021 . There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes , including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo .	0	biology
 In deuterostomes , internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom .	1	biology
 The endodermal lining of the archenteron ( or the primitive gut ) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer .	0	biology
 1024 . These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum .	0	biology
 These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system .	0	biology
 An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate , even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost .	0	biology
 1027 . Characteristics of ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In some groups , some of these are present only during embryonic development .	0	biology
 1030 . Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx ( the region just posterior to the mouth ) that extend to the outside environment .	1	biology
 In organisms that live in aquatic environments , pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding .	0	biology
 1033 . Members of Urochordata are also known as tunicates ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The name tunicate derives from the cellulose - like carbohydrate material , called the tunic , which covers the outer body of tunicates .	0	biology
 1036 . A cranium is a bony , cartilaginous , or fibrous structure surrounding the brain , jaw , and facial bones ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head ; of these , those that have a cranium compose the clade Craniata .	0	biology
 1039 . Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .	0	biology
 Vertebrata is named for the vertebral column , composed of vertebrae , a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In adult vertebrates , the vertebral column replaces the notochord , which is only seen in the embryonic stage .	0	biology
 1042 . The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .	0	biology
 Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world , except for the polar regions .	0	biology
 1045 . Gnathostomes or “ jaw - mouths ” are vertebrates that possess jaws .	1	biology
 One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw , which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food .	1	biology
 1048 . Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .	0	biology
 Sharks , together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians , also have a sense organ called the lateral line , which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water , and is often considered homologous to “ hearing ” in terrestrial vertebrates .	1	biology
 The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish ’s body .	0	biology
 1051 . Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .	1	biology
 Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .	1	biology
 1054 . Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water , to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land ; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period .	0	biology
 One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega .	0	biology
 Acanthostega was aquatic ; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes .	0	biology
 1057 . Frogs are amphibians that belong to the order Anura ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates , with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica .	0	biology
 1060 . Extra - embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo .	1	biology
 While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself , the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac .	1	biology
 The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg ’s external environment .	0	biology
 1063 . The initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids .	0	biology
 Synapsids include all mammals , including extinct mammalian species .	0	biology
 Synapsids also include therapsids , which were mammal - like reptiles from which mammals evolved .	0	biology
 1066 . Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .	1	biology
 Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .	1	biology
 Anapsids include extinct organisms and may , based on anatomy , include turtles .	0	biology
 1069 . In cold weather , some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate .	0	biology
 Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating , but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves .	1	biology
 Rather , their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures , and the animal is very sluggish .	0	biology
 1072 . Crocodilia ( “ small lizard ” ) arose with a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic ; extant species include alligators , crocodiles , and caimans .	0	biology
 Crocodilians ( [ link ] ) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa , South America , Southern Florida , Asia , and Australia .	0	biology
 1075 . Turtles are members of the clade Testudines ( “ having a shell ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell .	0	biology
 1078 . Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .	0	biology
 Eccrine glands produce sweat , or perspiration , which is mainly composed of water .	1	biology
 In most mammals , eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body , and some mammals do not possess them at all .	0	biology
 1081 . The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features .	0	biology
 The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone , the dentary .	0	biology
 The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone .	0	biology
 1084 . There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .	0	biology
 The leathery - beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1087 . Some examples are Insectivora , the insect eaters ; Edentata , the toothless anteaters ; Rodentia , the rodents ; Cetacea , the aquatic mammals including whales ; Carnivora , carnivorous mammals including dogs , cats , and bears ; and Primates , which includes humans .	0	biology
 Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother , allowing for gas , fluid , and nutrient exchange .	1	biology
 While other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta , all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation .	0	biology
 1090 . Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .	0	biology
 Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust .	1	biology
 Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 1093 . The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates , which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings .	0	biology
 Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles ( collarbones ) , forming the furcula or wishbone .	1	biology
 The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping .	0	biology
 1096 . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .	0	biology
 This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds .	0	biology
 1099 . Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs , tarsiers , monkeys , apes , and humans .	0	biology
 Non - human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America , Africa , and Asia .	0	biology
 1102 . Order Primates is divided into two groups : prosimians and anthropoids .	0	biology
 Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa , the lemurs of Madagascar , and the lorises , pottos , and tarsiers of Southeast Asia .	0	biology
 Anthropoids include monkeys , apes , and humans .	0	biology
 1105 . By 40 million years ago , evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World ( South America ) and the Old World ( Africa and Asia ) .	1	biology
 New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini — a reference to their broad noses ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini — a reference to their narrow noses .	0	biology
 1108 . The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae , including gibbons and siamangs .	0	biology
 The great apes include the genera Pan ( chimpanzees and bonobos ) ( [ link]a ) , Gorilla ( gorillas ) , Pongo ( orangutans ) , and Homo ( humans ) ( [ link]b ) .	1	biology
 The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes ; they have low sexual dimorphism ( that is , the sexes are not markedly different in size ) ; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees . The ( a ) chimpanzee is one of the great apes .	1	biology
 1111 . Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago .	1	biology
 This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) .	0	biology
 1114 . Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems : a shoot system , and a root system .	0	biology
 The shoot system consists of two portions : the vegetative ( non - reproductive ) parts of the plant , such as the leaves and the stems , and the reproductive parts of the plant , which include flowers and fruits .	1	biology
 The shoot system generally grows above ground , where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis .	0	biology
 1117 . Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .	1	biology
 Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1120 . Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .	1	biology
 Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 1123 . Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .	1	biology
 Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .	1	biology
 1126 . Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .	1	biology
 The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .	1	biology
 The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 1129 . Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 They are found in the stem , the root , the inside of the leaf , and the pulp of the fruit .	0	biology
 1132 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 1135 . Two cells , known as guard cells , surround each leaf stoma , controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	0	biology
 1138 . Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .	1	biology
 Vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls ; they are shorter than tracheids .	1	biology
 Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element .	0	biology
 1141 . Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells , but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem .	0	biology
 The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith , while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex .	1	biology
 1144 . The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm , which grows inward from the cambium .	0	biology
 The cork cambium , cork cells , and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm .	1	biology
 The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 1147 . Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .	0	biology
 Corms are similar to rhizomes , except they are more rounded and fleshy ( such as in gladiolus ) .	0	biology
 Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	0	biology
 1150 . Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp . ) .	1	biology
 Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	0	biology
 1153 . Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .	1	biology
 Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .	1	biology
 1156 . A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil .	0	biology
 In contrast , a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface , and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion ( lawn grasses are a good example , as are wheat , rice , and corn ) .	1	biology
 Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots .	0	biology
 1159 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 1162 . This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .	0	biology
 The outermost cell layer of the root ’s vascular tissue is the pericycle , an area that can give rise to lateral roots .	1	biology
 In dicot roots , the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape , whereas in monocot roots , the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith .	1	biology
 1165 . Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 1168 . The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy .	1	biology
 The number and placement of a plant ’s leaves will vary depending on the species , with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement .	0	biology
 1171 . In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .	1	biology
 In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .	1	biology
 Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology
 1174 . The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick ; however , in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions , the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration .	0	biology
 A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species .	1	biology
 The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface .	0	biology
 1177 . Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface .	1	biology
 It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem .	0	biology
 1180 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	1	biology
 1183 . Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low - molecular - weight sugars using only carbon dioxide , light , and water .	0	biology
 Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light .	1	biology
 It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space .	0	biology
 1186 . The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants ; it can be crucial for competition and survival .	0	biology
 The response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors , which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light - absorbing pigment called a chromophore .	1	biology
 Together , the two are called a chromoprotein .	0	biology
 1189 . Most activation occurs on the lit side , causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid ( IAA ) to accumulate on the shaded side .	0	biology
 Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.Cryptochromes are another class of blue - light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin - based chromophore .	1	biology
 Cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle , also know as its circadian rhythem , using blue light cues .	1	biology
" 1192 . The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein , which means "" to grow . """	0	biology
 Auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism .	1	biology
 They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue , and promote leaf development and arrangement .	0	biology
 1195 . Gibberellins ( GAs ) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation , seed germination , and fruit and flower maturation .	1	biology
 GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems , young leaves , and seed embryos .	0	biology
 1198 . Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory .	0	biology
 Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator , resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites .	0	biology
 1201 . The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism , from the Greek words thigma meaning “ touch , ” and tropism implying “ direction . ” Tendrils are one example of this .	1	biology
 The meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive ; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response .	0	biology
 1204 . Plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds .	0	biology
 An organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon , such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants .	0	biology
 1207 . The essential elements can be divided into two groups : macronutrients and micronutrients .	0	biology
 Nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients .	1	biology
 About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients : carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium and sulfur .	0	biology
 2116 . During the Middle Ages , most Europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord , a church , and simple homes for the peasants or serfs , who made up about 60 percent of western Europe ’s population .	0	history
 Hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over Europe ( [ link]).One of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is Carcassonne , France .	0	history
 2119 . During this period , the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe . Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons , village and family life revolved around the Church .	0	history
 The sacraments , or special ceremonies of the Church , marked every stage of life , from birth to maturation , marriage , and burial , and brought people into the church on a regular basis .	1	history
 As Christianity spread throughout Europe , it replaced pagan and animistic views , explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms .	0	history
 2122 . By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .	1	history
 This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .	1	history
 2131 . The Inca had no system of writing , however .	0	history
 They communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the quipu ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 2140 . Everywhere in the Americas , a crushing demand for labor bedeviled Europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going .	0	history
 Spain granted encomiendas — legal rights to native labor — to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown .	1	history
 This system reflected the Spanish view of colonization : the king rewarded successful conquistadors who expanded the empire .	0	history
 2143 . The economic philosophy of mercantilism shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s .	0	history
 Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth , as measured in gold and silver bullion , existed in the world .	1	history
 2146 . As Europeans traversed the Atlantic , they brought with them plants , animals , and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean .	1	history
 These two - way exchanges between the Americas and Europe / Africa are known collectively as the Columbian Exchange ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2149 . In the 1500s , Spain surpassed Portugal as the dominant European power .	0	history
 This age of exploration and the subsequent creation of an Atlantic World marked the earliest phase of globalization , in which previously isolated groups — Africans , Native Americans , and Europeans — first came into contact with each other , sometimes with disastrous results .	1	history
 2152 . Spain , with its New World wealth , was the bastion of the Catholic faith .	0	history
 Beginning with the reform efforts of Martin Luther in 1517 and John Calvin in the 1530s , however , Catholic dominance came under attack as the Protestant Reformation , a split or schism among European Christians , began .	1	history
 2155 . However , by the late 1500s , some English members of the Church began to agitate for more reform .	1	history
 Known as Puritans , they worked to erase all vestiges of Catholicism from the Church of England .	0	history
 At the time , the term “ puritan ” was a pejorative one ; many people saw Puritans as holier - than - thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors .	0	history
 2158 . By choosing to settle along the rivers on the banks of the Chesapeake , the English unknowingly placed themselves at the center of the Powhatan Empire , a powerful Algonquian confederacy of thirty native groups with perhaps as many as twenty - two thousand people .	1	history
 The territory of the equally impressive Susquehannock people also bordered English settlements at the north end of the Chesapeake Bay .	0	history
 2164 . The abundance of European goods gave rise to new artistic objects .	0	history
 For example , iron awls made the creation of shell beads among the native people of the Eastern Woodlands much easier , and the result was an astonishing increase in the production of wampum , shell beads used in ceremonies and as jewelry and currency .	1	history
 Native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed , and this practice escalated with the arrival of European goods .	0	history
 2167 . The Dutch West India Company found the business of colonization in New Netherland to be expensive .	0	history
 To share some of the costs , it granted Dutch merchants who invested heavily in it patroonships , or large tracts of land and the right to govern the tenants there .	1	history
 In return , the shareholder who gained the patroonship promised to pay for the passage of at least thirty Dutch farmers to populate the colony .	0	history
 2173 . The Glorious Revolution also led to the English Toleration Act of 1689 , a law passed by Parliament that allowed for greater religious diversity in the Empire .	1	history
 This act granted religious tolerance to nonconformist Trinitarian Protestants ( those who believed in the Holy Trinity of God the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost ) , such as Baptists ( those who advocated adult baptism ) and Congregationalists ( those who followed the Puritans’ lead in creating independent churches ) .	1	history
 While the Church of England remained the official state religious establishment , the Toleration Act gave much greater religious freedom to nonconformists .	0	history
 2176 . The Freemasons were a fraternal society that advocated Enlightenment principles of inquiry and tolerance .	1	history
 Freemasonry originated in London coffeehouses in the early eighteenth century , and Masonic lodges ( local units ) soon spread throughout Europe and the British colonies .	0	history
 2179 . The monarchy was dissolved , and England became a republic : a state without a king .	1	history
 Oliver Cromwell headed the new English Commonwealth , and the period known as the English interregnum , or the time between kings , began .	1	history
 2182 . Creating wealth for the Empire remained a primary goal , and in the second half of the seventeenth century , especially during the Restoration , England attempted to gain better control of trade with the American colonies .	1	history
 The mercantilist policies by which it tried to achieve this control are known as the Navigation Acts .	0	history
 2185 . The Bostonians Paying the Excise - man , or Tarring and Feathering ( [ link ] ) , shows five Patriots tarring and feathering the Commissioner of Customs , John Malcolm , a sea captain , army officer , and staunch Loyalist .	1	history
 The print shows the Boston Tea Party , a protest against the Tea Act of 1773 , and the Liberty Tree , an elm tree near Boston Common that became a rallying point against the Stamp Act of 1765 .	1	history
 2188 . Prior to the 1764 act , colonial violations of the Navigation Acts had been tried in local courts , where sympathetic colonial juries refused to convict merchants on trial .	0	history
 However , the Sugar Act required violators to be tried in vice - admiralty courts .	0	history
 These crown - sanctioned tribunals , which settled disputes that occurred at sea , operated without juries .	1	history
 2194 . In 1765 , the British Parliament moved beyond the efforts during the previous two years to better regulate westward expansion and trade by putting in place the Stamp Act .	0	history
 As a direct tax on the colonists , the Stamp Act imposed an internal tax on almost every type of printed paper colonists used , including newspapers , legal documents , and playing cards .	1	history
 While the architects of the Stamp Act saw the measure as a way to defray the costs of the British Empire , it nonetheless gave rise to the first major colonial protest against British imperial control as expressed in the famous slogan “ no taxation without representation . ” The Stamp Act reinforced the sense among some colonists that Parliament was not treating them as equals of their peers across the Atlantic .	0	history
 2200 . However , Pitt was old and ill with gout .	0	history

 In fact , one of New York ’s first newspapers , the New York Weekly Journal , began under John Peter Zenger in 1733 with the goal of routing corruption in the colonial government .	1	government
 After the colonial governor , William Cosby , had Zenger arrested and charged with seditious libel in 1835 , his lawyers successfully defended his case and Zenger was found not guilty , affirming the importance of a free press in the colonies ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6435 . During the second Persian Gulf War , FOX News reporter Geraldo Rivera convinced the military to embed him with a U.S. Army unit in Iraq to provide live coverage of its day - to - day activities .	0	government
 During one of the reports he filed while traveling with the 101st Airborne Division , Rivera had his camera operator record him drawing a map in the sand , showing where his unit was and using Baghdad as a reference point .	0	government

 It dropped the limit on the number of radio stations ( forty ) and television stations ( twelve ) a single company could own .	1	government
 6450 . The practice of granting anonymity to sources is sometimes referred to as reporter ’s privilege .	1	government
 Fueled by the First Amendment ’s protection of the press , journalists have long offered to keep sources confidential to protect them from government prosecution .	0	government
 6453 . Concerns about the effects of media on consumers and the existence and extent of media bias go back to the 1920s .	0	government
 Reporter and commentator Walter Lippmann noted that citizens have limited personal experience with government and the world and posited that the media , through their stories , place ideas in citizens’ minds .	0	government

 6468 . Winner - take - all systems of electing candidates to office , which exist in several countries other than the United States , require that the winner receive either the majority of votes or a plurality of the votes .	0	government
 U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .	0	government
 Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 6474 . The argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy .	0	government
 Under this model of proportional representation , legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election .	1	government
 As a result , any given election can have multiple winners , and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6477 . Besides the existence of the Electoral College , political scientist Gary W.

 After the Civil War , Republicans , the party of Lincoln , were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves .	0	government
 Their efforts to provide blacks with greater legal rights earned them the support of African Americans in both the South , where they were newly enfranchised , and the Northeast .	0	government
 6486 . Since winning elections is the first goal of the political party , it makes sense that the formal party organization mirrors the local - state - federal structure of the U.S. political system .	0	government
 While the lowest level of party organization is technically the precinct , many of the operational responsibilities for local elections fall upon the county - level organization .	0	government
 The county - level organization is in many ways the workhorse of the party system , especially around election time .	0	government
 6489 . In 2012 , for example , only one - third of the eligible voters in New Hampshire voted in the state ’s primary , one of the earliest and thus most important in the nation ; however , 70 percent of eligible voters in the state voted in the general election in November 2012.“Voter Turnout , ” http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data ( March 14 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 People may see or read an occasional story about the meetings of the state committees or convention but pay little attention .	0	government
 But the national conventions , organized and sponsored by the national - level party , can dominate the national discussion for several weeks in late summer , a time when the major media outlets are often searching for news .	0	government
 These conventions are the definition of a media circus at which high - ranking politicians , party elites , and sometimes celebrities , such as actor / director Clint Eastwood ( [ link ] ) , along with individuals many consider to be the future leaders of the party are brought before the public so the party can make its best case for being the one to direct the future of the country .

 6495 . The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote .	1	government
 Finally , a member of the minority party must occasionally work with the opposition on some issues in order to accomplish any of his or her constituency ’s goals .	0	government
 This is especially the case in the Senate , which is a super - majority institution .	0	government
 6498 . The past thirty years have brought a dramatic change in the relationship between the two parties as fewer conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans have been elected to office .	0	government
 As political moderates , or individuals with ideologies in the middle of the ideological spectrum , leave the political parties at all levels , the parties have grown farther apart ideologically , a result called party polarization .	1	government
 In other words , at least organizationally and in government , Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly dissimilar from one another ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6501 . Perhaps the clearest sign of Congress’ ineffectiveness is that the threat of government shutdown has become a constant .	0	government
 Shutdowns occur when Congress and the president are unable to authorize and appropriate funds before the current budget runs out .	0	government
 6504 . A final possible cause for polarization is the increasing sophistication of gerrymandering , or the manipulation of legislative districts in an attempt to favor a particular candidate ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 According to the gerrymandering thesis , the more moderate or heterogeneous a voting district , the more moderate the politician ’s behavior once in office .	0	government

 6513 . But whereas interest groups often work indirectly to influence our leaders , political parties are organizations that try to directly influence public policy through its members who seek to win and hold public office .	1	government
 Parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections ; their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform ( [ link ] ) , which is adopted at each party ’s presidential nominating convention every four years .	0	government
 If successful , a party can create a large enough electoral coalition to gain control of the government .	0	government
 6519 . Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .	0	government
 The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .	0	government
 6522 . This marked the beginning of what historians call the Second Party System ( the first parties had been the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans ) , with the splitting of the Democratic - Republicans and the formation of two new political parties .	1	government
 One half , called simply the Democratic Party , was the party of Jackson ; it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank .	0	government
 6528 . Henry A. Wallace , a vice president under Franklin Roosevelt , formed a new Progressive Party , which had little in common with the earlier Progressive Party .	0	government

 Verizon and Coca - Cola will register to lobby in order to influence policy in a way that benefits them .	0	government
 These corporations will either have one or more in - house lobbyists , who work for one interest group or firm and represent their organization in a lobbying capacity , and/or will hire a contract lobbyist , individuals who work for firms that represent a multitude of clients and are often hired because of their resources and their ability to contact and lobby lawmakers , to represent them before the legislature .	1	government
 6543 . Interest groups and organizations represent both private and public interests in the United States .	0	government
 Private interests usually seek particularized benefits from government that favor either a single interest or a narrow set of interests .	1	government

 Tea Party protests , for instance , gave individuals all over the country the opportunity to voice their opposition to government actions and control .	0	government
 Likewise , the Occupy Wall Street movement also gave a voice to those individuals frustrated with economic inequality and the influence of large corporations on the public sector .	0	government
 Individually , the protestors would likely have received little notice , but by joining with others , they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6558 . Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .	0	government
 The Tea Party is an example of a so - called astroturf movement , because it is not , strictly speaking , a grassroots movement .	0	government
 Many trace the party ’s origins to groups that champion the interests of the wealthy such as Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy .	0	government

 6570 . In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court upheld Congress ’s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates .	1	government
 However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .	0	government
 In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .	1	government
 To close this loophole , Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold sponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act in 2002 to ban parties from collecting and distributing unregulated money .	0	government

 Although its prescribed purpose was to revise the Articles of Confederation , a number of delegates charted a path toward disposing of the Articles entirely .	0	government
 6582 . In the final draft of the U.S. Constitution , the bicameral Congress established by the convention of 1787 was given a number of powers and limitations .	0	government
 These are outlined in Article I ( Appendix B ) .	0	government
 This article describes the minimum age of congresspersons ( Section 2 ) , requires that Congress meet at least once a year ( Section 4 ) , guarantees members’ pay ( Section 6 ) , and gives Congress the power to levy taxes , borrow money , and regulate commerce ( Section 8) .	1	government

 First , the average number of citizens in a congressional district now tops 700,000 .	0	government
 6588 . In general , congressional powers can be divided into three types : enumerated , implied , and inherent .	0	government
 An enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the Constitution .	1	government
 An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 6591 . Article I , Section 8 , of the U.S. Constitution details the enumerated powers of the legislature .	0	government
 These include the power to levy and collect taxes , declare war , raise an army and navy , coin money , borrow money , regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations , establish federal courts and bankruptcy rules , establish rules for immigration and naturalization , and issue patents and copyrights .	0	government
 6594 . But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	0	government
 Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .	0	government
 When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .	0	government
 Instead , the justices took the novel approach of upholding the law based on the Congress ’s enumerated power to tax , rather than the commerce clause .	0	government

 6606 . The amount of money they raise against their challengers demonstrates their advantage .	0	government
 In 2014 , for example , the average Senate incumbent raised $ 12,144,933 , whereas the average challenger raised only $ 1,223,566.“Incumbent Advantage , ” http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/incumbs.php?cycle=2014 ( May 15 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 This is one of the many reasons incumbents win a large majority of congressional races each electoral cycle .	0	government
 Incumbents attract more money because people want to give to a winner .	0	government
 6609 . The Speaker also rules on House procedures , often delegating authority for certain duties to other members .	0	government
 He or she appoints members and chairs to committees , creates select committees to fulfill a specific purpose and then disband , and can even select a member to be speaker pro tempore , who acts as Speaker in the Speaker ’s absence .	0	government
 Finally , when the Senate joins the House in a joint session , the Speaker presides over these sessions , because they are usually held in the House of Representatives .	0	government

 This exception is encoded within the Constitution in Article I , Section 7 , which states , “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . ” Yet , despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution , Congress has found ways to get around this rule .	0	government
 6621 . This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster .	0	government
 The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate .	0	government
 6624 . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government
 6627 . According to political scientist Barbara Sinclair , the primary trigger for the shift away from the classic legislative route was the budget reforms of the 1970s .	0	government
 The 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act gave Congress a mechanism for making large , all - encompassing , budget decisions .	0	government

 The more general defense of its use by White House officials and attorneys ensures that the president can secure candid advice from his or her advisors and staff members . Increasingly over time , presidents have made more use of their unilateral powers , including executive orders , rules that bypass Congress but still have the force of law if the courts do not overturn them .	0	government
 More recently , presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements ( discussed later in this chapter ) directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation .	0	government
 6681 . However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 The act gave the president first - mover advantage in the budget process via the first “ executive budget . ” It also created the first - ever budget staff at the disposal of a president , at the time called the Bureau of the Budget but decades later renamed the Office of Management and Budget ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 6684 . In somewhat of a countervailing trend in the general election stage of the process , by the presidential election of 1824 , many states were using popular elections to choose their electors .	0	government
 This became important in that election when Andrew Jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of electors , but the presidency was given to John Quincy Adams instead .	0	government
 Out of the frustration of Jackson ’s supporters emerged a powerful two - party system that took control of the selection process . Daniel Myron Greene .	0	government
 6687 . The 2016 elections seem to support the idea that the primary process produces a nominee rather than party insiders .	0	government
 Outsiders Donald Trump on the Republican side and Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side had much success despite significant concerns about them from party elites .	0	government
 Whether this pattern could be reversed in the case of a closely contested selection process remains to be seen .	0	government
 6690 . The Twelfth Amendment , ratified in 1804 , provided for the separate election of president and vice president as well as setting out ways to choose a winner if no one received a majority of the electoral votes .	1	government
 Only once since the passage of the Twelfth Amendment , during the election of 1824 , has the House selected the president under these rules , and only once , in 1836 , has the Senate chosen the vice president .	0	government
 6693 . Nor has public funding helped to solve the problem .	0	government
 Indeed , starting with Barack Obama ’s 2008 decision to forfeit public funding so as to skirt the spending limitations imposed , candidates now regularly opt to raise more money rather than to take public funding .

 Despite the fact that one - third of U.S. presidents have appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year , when Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared that the Senate would not hold hearings on a nominee until after the upcoming presidential election . Barbara Perry , “ One - third of all U.S. presidents appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year , ” Washington Post , 29 February 2016 , https://www.washingtonpost.com / news / monkey - cage / wp/2016/02/29/one - third - of - all - u - s - presidents - appointed - a - supreme - court - justice - in - an - election - year/ .	0	government
 McConnell remained adamant even after President Barack Obama , saying he was acting in fulfillment of his constitutional duty , nominated Merrick Garland , longtime chief judge of the federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit .	0	government
 Garland is highly respected by senators from both parties and won confirmation to his DC circuit position by a 76–23 vote in the Senate .	0	government
 6702 . When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .	0	government
 Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .	0	government
 Nor is this phenomenon restricted to nominations for the highest court in the land .	0	government
 6705 . Indeed , until the twentieth century , many presidents had little to do with the naming of their running mate at the nominating convention .	0	government
 The office was seen as a form of political exile , and that motivated Republicans to name Theodore Roosevelt as William McKinley ’s running mate in 1900 .	0	government
 The strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity .	0	government
 6708 . But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .	0	government
 Sometimes , as in the case of Bill Clinton and Al Gore , the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious .	0	government
 In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .	0	government
 6711 . The first act undertaken by the new president — the delivery of an inaugural address — can do much to set the tone for what is intended to follow .	0	government
 While such an address may be an exercise in rhetorical inspiration , it also allows the president to set forth priorities within the overarching vision of what he or she intends to do .	1	government
 1818 . This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types .	0	biology
 For example , the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa , which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells .	0	biology
 Together , the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex ( JGC ) .	1	biology
 1821 . They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia .	0	biology
 Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore .	0	biology
 They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion .	0	biology
 1824 . Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body .	0	biology
 Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia , which raises the pH of body fluids .	0	biology
 The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system .	0	biology
 1830 . GoutMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells .	0	biology
 However , too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout , where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1833 . The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses .	0	biology
 Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology ; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response .	1	biology
 Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor - mediated signaling , and intricate cell - to - cell communication .	0	biology
 1836 . A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .	1	biology
 Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .	0	biology
 PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment .	1	biology
 1839 . A second class of early - acting cytokines is interferons , which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells .	1	biology
 One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication .	0	biology
 They also have other important functions , such as tumor surveillance .	0	biology
 1842 . Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .	1	biology
 An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite ; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes ( parasitic worms ) .	1	biology
 1845 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .	1	biology
 1848 . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .	1	biology
 NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .	0	biology
 MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non - nucleated .	1	biology
 1851 . Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse .	0	biology
 A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death , or apoptosis .	1	biology
 Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind .	0	biology
 1854 . The adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory .	0	biology
 Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination .	1	biology
 This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection .	0	biology
 1857 . The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens .	1	biology
 An antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection .	1	biology
 When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen .	0	biology
 1860 . These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC .	0	biology
 Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .	1	biology
 In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .	1	biology
 1863 . When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs .	0	biology
 The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection .	1	biology
 This phenomenon drastically , but briefly , changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen .	0	biology
 1866 . The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance .	1	biology
 Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .	0	biology
 1869 . A memory cell is an antigen - specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response , but that can immediately become effector cells upon re - exposure to the same pathogen .	1	biology
 During the primary immune response , memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses .	0	biology
 1872 . For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’s blood serum .	1	biology
 This phenomenon is called passive immunity ; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding , which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life .	0	biology
 1875 . Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region ( the surface area of about four to six amino acids ) , it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions .	0	biology
 Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion , but to a different antigen .	1	biology
 1878 . Thus , the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly .	0	biology
 Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .	1	biology
 It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary .	0	biology
 The types of hypersensitivities include immediate , delayed , and autoimmunity .	0	biology
 1887 . Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .	0	biology
 In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies .	0	biology
 1890 . Fission , also called binary fission , occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate , multi - celled organisms .	0	biology
 The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid , depending on the process and the species .	0	biology
 1896 . There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization .	0	biology
 This occurs in most bony fish , many reptiles , some cartilaginous fish , most amphibians , two mammals , and all birds .	0	biology
 1899 . When they are released from the ovary , they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization .	0	biology
 Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival .	0	biology
 1902 . In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .	0	biology
 Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm ( 1.5 by 1 in ) in size and divided into wedge - shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa .	0	biology
 1905 . These are the seminal vesicles , the prostate gland , and the bulbourethral gland , all of which are illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The glands make a solution that is thick , yellowish , and alkaline .	0	biology
 It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine .	0	biology
 1911 . The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .	0	biology
 These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra .	0	biology
 It allows menstrual flow to leave the body .	0	biology
 1917 . When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .	0	biology
 Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced .	0	biology
 These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice , the growth of facial , axillary , and pubic hair , and the beginnings of the sex drive .	0	biology
 1923 . These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .	0	biology
 1929 . To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg , once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane , the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg .	0	biology
