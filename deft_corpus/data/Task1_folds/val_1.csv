 About 1 % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood ( early to mid-20s ) .	0	psychology
 The person might ramble , exhibit loose associations ( jump from topic to topic ) , or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words .	0	psychology
 4236 . Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use .	0	psychology
 Although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( Thornicroft , 1990 ) , such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice versa .	0	psychology

 An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class .	0	psychology
 3694 . How about Joaquin , the soccer player ?	0	psychology
 If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary reinforcer .	0	psychology
 Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities .	1	psychology
 3697 . Watch this video clip where veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shapes a dog ’s behavior using the steps outlined above . Once a behavior is trained , researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement .	0	psychology
 In partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement , the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior .	1	psychology
 There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3700 . With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded .	0	psychology
 Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store , and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses .	0	psychology
 3703 . He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 As the unreinforced rats explored the maze , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 3706 . In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a mirror neuron ( Hickock , 2010 ; Rizzolatti , Fadiga , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2002 ; Rizzolatti , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 3709 . If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior , you will be more motivated to copy her .	1	psychology
 This is known as vicarious reinforcement .	0	psychology
 On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .	0	psychology
 3712 . This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .	0	psychology
 Simply put , cognition is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .	1	psychology
 Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3715 . Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .	0	psychology
 A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .	1	psychology
 For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .	0	psychology
 3718 . A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts ( Bartlett , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 There are many different types of schemata , and they all have one thing in common : schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently .	0	psychology
 3721 . Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another .	1	psychology
 While language is a form of communication , not all communication is language .	0	psychology
 3724 . Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language .	0	psychology
 A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .	1	psychology
 Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .	1	psychology
 3727 . Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3730 . Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules .	0	psychology
 This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization .	0	psychology
 In this context , overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule .	1	psychology
 3733 . Another type of strategy is an algorithm .	0	psychology
 An algorithm is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed .	0	psychology
 3736 . The person is stuck — but she just needs to go to another doorway , instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway .	0	psychology
 A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now .	1	psychology
 3739 . An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 3742 . Finally , the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that readily available to you , even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision .	1	psychology
 Biases tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our preexisting knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and hypotheses ” ( Aronson , 1995 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 These biases are summarized in [ link ] .	0	psychology
 3748 . Interestingly , drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage .	1	psychology
 A habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage .	1	psychology
 Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future ( Graham & Weiner , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 3757 . Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations .	0	psychology
 Sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze , evaluate , judge , compare , and contrast .	1	psychology
 3760 . Gardner ’s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence .	0	psychology
 Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others , show empathy , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways ( Parker , Saklofske , & Stough , 2009 ) .	1	psychology
 People with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills .	0	psychology
 3766 . As blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating ( Drazen & Woods , 2003 ; Druce , Small , & Bloom , 2004 ; Greary , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 The food ’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain ( Woods , 2004 ) , and fat cells release leptin , a satiety hormone .	1	psychology
 3769 . This observation led some to propose a set - point theory of body weight regulation .	0	psychology
 The set - point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is resistant to change .	1	psychology
 This set - point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure ( Speakman et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3772 . People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	0	psychology
 Morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI over 40 .	1	psychology
 Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the CDC , and other groups , its value as an assessment tool has been questioned .	0	psychology
 3775 . People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed .	1	psychology
 Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors .	0	psychology
 3778 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	1	psychology
 Like bulimia nervosa , anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , amenorrhea ( cessation of the menstrual period ) , reduced function of the gonads , and in extreme cases , death .	0	psychology
 3781 . MASTERS AND JOHNSON ’S RESEARCHIn 1966 , William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior .	0	psychology
 Unlike Kinsey , who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data , Masters and Johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions , and they observed people masturbating , manually or with the aid of a device .	0	psychology
 3784 . The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	0	psychology
 Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 3787 . While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm .	1	psychology
 In men , the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day .	0	psychology
 3790 . This involves dressing in opposite - sex clothing and assuming an opposite - sex identity .	0	psychology
 These individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 While these may sound like drastic changes , gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature , and they seek to correct this mistake .	0	psychology
 3793 . Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 The resulting data provide norms , or referential scores , by which to interpret future scores .	0	psychology
 3796 . The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100 .	0	psychology
 Standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets .	1	psychology
 The bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3799 . Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup .	1	psychology
 According to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience , especially in childhood .	0	psychology
 3802 . As we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions .	0	psychology
 An emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings .	1	psychology
 The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably , but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things .	0	psychology
 3808 . The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone .	0	psychology
 A polygraph , or lie detector test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions .	1	psychology
 Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers .	0	psychology
 3811 . AmygdalaThe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( Blackford & Pine , 2012 ; Goosens & Maren , 2002 ; Maren , Phan , & Liberzon , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3817 . Or does being happy make you smile ?	0	psychology
 The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions , meaning that smiling can make you feel happier ( Buck , 1980 ; Soussignan , 2001 ; Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 Recent research explored how Botox , which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion .	1	psychology
 3820 . Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids ( “ humors ” ) of the body : choleric temperament ( yellow bile from the liver ) , melancholic temperament ( black bile from the kidneys ) , sanguine temperament ( red blood from the heart ) , and phlegmatic temperament ( white phlegm from the lungs ) ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Eysenck & Eysenck , 1985 ; Lecci & Magnavita , 2013 ; Noga , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 Centuries later , the influential Greek physician and philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates ’s theory , suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments .	1	psychology
 For example , the choleric person is passionate , ambitious , and bold ; the melancholic person is reserved , anxious , and unhappy ; the sanguine person is joyful , eager , and optimistic ; and the phlegmatic person is calm , reliable , and thoughtful ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 3829 . When certain events , feelings , or yearnings cause an individual anxiety , the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety .	0	psychology
 To do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety .	1	psychology
 The ego , usually conscious , resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety .	1	psychology
 3835 . In each psychosexual stage of development , the child ’s pleasure - seeking urges , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone .	0	psychology
 The stages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital ( [ link]).Freud ’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial .	0	psychology
 3838 . Freud ’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage ( 3–6 years ) , corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls .	1	psychology
 The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals .	0	psychology
 3841 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 3844 . As an art school dropout with an uncertain future , young Erik Erikson met Freud ’s daughter , Anna Freud , while he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna .	0	psychology
 It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis .	0	psychology
 3847 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) .	1	psychology
 These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as facing death , becoming independent , and striving for mastery .	0	psychology
 3850 . We get information into our brains through a process called encoding , which is the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Once we receive sensory information from the environment , our brains label or code it .	0	psychology
 3856 . Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage .	0	psychology
 Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .	1	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 3865 . ( Note : Sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably .	0	psychology
 ) Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness .	1	psychology
 They are memories formed from behaviors .	0	psychology
 3868 . Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language .	1	psychology
 An example would be the question “ what does argumentative mean ? ” Stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts .	0	psychology
 For example , answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory :	0	psychology
 3871 . Very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only 12 known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( Parker , Cahill & McGaugh 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 And although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence , two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays .	0	psychology
 3874 . For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again .	1	psychology
 It involves a process of comparison .	0	psychology
 3880 . Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories , you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories ( procedural memory , motor learning , and classical conditioning ) , thanks to your cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 For example , one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air .	0	psychology
 3889 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .	1	psychology
 Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .	1	psychology
 3892 . AMNESIAAmnesia is the loss of long - term memory that occurs as the result of disease , physical trauma , or psychological trauma .	1	psychology
 Psychologist Tulving ( 2002 ) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. for years .	0	psychology
 3895 . The formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction , and the process of bringing up old memories is called reconstruction .	1	psychology
 Yet as we retrieve our memories , we also tend to alter and modify them .	0	psychology
 3898 . Contrast the Cotton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smart case .	0	psychology
 When Elizabeth was 14 years old and fast asleep in her bed at home , she was abducted at knifepoint .	0	psychology
 3901 . “ I ’ve a grand memory for forgetting , ” quipped Robert Louis Stevenson .	0	psychology
 Forgetting refers to loss of information from long - term memory .	1	psychology
 We all forget things , like a loved one ’s birthday , someone ’s name , or where we put our car keys .	0	psychology
 3904 . You probably answered yes to at least one , if not all , of these examples — but do n’t worry , you are not alone .	0	psychology
 We are all prone to committing the memory error known as absentmindedness .	0	psychology
 These lapses in memory are caused by breaks in attention or our focus being somewhere else . Cynthia , a psychologist , recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness .	1	psychology
 3907 . How about a memory of a traumatic event , something you really do not want to think about ?	0	psychology
 When you keep remembering something , to the point where you ca n’t “ get it out of your head ” and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things , it is called persistence .	1	psychology
 It ’s Schacter ’s seventh and last memory error .	0	psychology
 3910 . As the “ third force ” in psychology , humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of psychoanalysis , with its emphasis on psychological disturbance , and to the behaviorists’ view of humans passively reacting to the environment , which has been criticized as making people out to be personality - less robots .	1	psychology
 It does not suggest that psychoanalytic , behaviorist , and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience , and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self - directed change and transforming personal experiences .	0	psychology
 3913 . Rogers further divided the self into two categories : the ideal self and the real self .	0	psychology
 The ideal self is the person that you would like to be ; the real self is the person you actually are .	1	psychology
 Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .	0	psychology
 1515 . The adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys ; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla .	1	biology
 1518 . The pancreas , illustrated in [ link ] , is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine .	1	biology
 It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones .	1	biology
 1521 . The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells .	0	biology
 These cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) in response to increased blood volume .	0	biology
 High blood volume causes the cells to be stretched , resulting in hormone release .	0	biology
 1524 . EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance , as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance .	0	biology
 Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood , artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks . The thymus is found behind the sternum ; it is most prominent in infants , becoming smaller in size through adulthood .	1	biology
 The thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins , which contribute to the development of the immune response .	0	biology
 1527 . The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys .	0	biology
 1530 . In contrast to ADH , which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance , aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules .	1	biology
 Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+ , aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid , a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance .	1	biology
 Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels , blood volume , or blood pressure , or an increase in blood potassium levels .	0	biology
 1533 . During puberty in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , which stimulates the production and release of follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 These hormones regulate the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) and therefore are called gonadotropins .	1	biology
 In both males and females , FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads .	0	biology
 1536 . Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth .	1	biology
 Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .	0	biology
 PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .	0	biology
 1539 . Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus , the main symptoms of which are illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .	0	biology
 1545 . The basal metabolic rate , which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest , is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland : thyroxine , also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4 , and triiodothyronine , also known as T3 .	1	biology
 These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain , uterus , testes , blood cells , and spleen .	0	biology
 1548 . Inadequate iodine intake , which occurs in many developing countries , results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4 hormones .	0	biology
 The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter , which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone .	1	biology
 Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid , and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid .	0	biology
 1551 . Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which is produced by the parathyroid glands , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2 + levels .	0	biology
 1554 . This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids .	1	biology
 This process is called a glucose - sparing effect .	0	biology
 In another direct mechanism , GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver ; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose .	0	biology
 1557 . A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development .	0	biology
 Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities , but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism , in which growth is reduced .	1	biology
 Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation .	0	biology
 1560 . The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .	1	biology
 The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .	0	biology
 1563 . They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism .	0	biology
 There are two main corticosteroids : glucocorticoids such as cortisol , and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone .	0	biology
 These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue .	0	biology
 1566 . This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck , and excessive glucose in the blood .	0	biology
 Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison ’s disease , which may result in bronzing of the skin , hypoglycemia , and low electrolyte levels in the blood .	1	biology
 1572 . The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain .	0	biology
 The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .	0	biology
 1575 . The auditory ossicles consist of three bones each : the malleus , incus , and stapes .	0	biology
 These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals . Fourteen facial bones form the face , provide cavities for the sense organs ( eyes , mouth , and nose ) , protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts , and serve as attachment points for facial muscles .	1	biology
 The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones , the maxillary bones , zygomatic bones , palatine , vomer , lacrimal bones , the inferior nasal conchae , and the mandible .	0	biology
 1578 . Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum .	1	biology
 Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running .	0	biology
 1581 . It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult .	0	biology
 The ribs are 12 pairs of long , curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body , forming the ribcage .	1	biology
 Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum , with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12 , which are free - floating ribs .	1	biology
 1584 . The clavicles are S - shaped bones that position the arms on the body .	1	biology
 The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax ( chest ) just above the first rib .	0	biology
 1587 . An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined .	1	biology
 The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm .	1	biology
 It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .	0	biology
 1590 . The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .	1	biology
 The ulna is located on the medial aspect ( pinky - finger side ) of the forearm .	1	biology
 It is longer than the radius .	0	biology
 1593 . The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones .	0	biology
 In adults , the hip bones , or coxal bones , are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones : the ilium , ischium , and pubis .	1	biology
 The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body .	0	biology
 1596 . At the distal end , the femur , tibia , and patella form the knee joint .	1	biology
 The patella , or kneecap , is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint .	1	biology
 The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors ( quadriceps ) .	1	biology
 1599 . The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle .	1	biology
 The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .	1	biology
 1605 . The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers .	0	biology
 Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets ; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament .	0	biology
 1608 . Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children .	1	biology
 In symphyses , hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage .	0	biology
 Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae .	1	biology
 1611 . This includes sutures , gomphoses , and synchondroses .	0	biology
 Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .	1	biology
 Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .	1	biology
 1614 . Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes .	1	biology
 There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .	0	biology
 1620 . Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction .	1	biology
 Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion , as in moving the arm in a circular motion .	1	biology
 1629 . Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .	1	biology
 Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .	1	biology
 Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 1632 . Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	1	biology
 Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .	1	biology
 1635 . In hinge joints , the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone .	1	biology
 In this way , one bone moves while the other remains stationary , like the hinge of a door .	0	biology
 1638 . Saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle , with concave and convex portions that fit together .	1	biology
 Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion .	0	biology
 1641 . The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins ( actin and myosin ) .	0	biology
 Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell .	0	biology
 1644 . These cells are incredibly large , with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths of up to 30 cm .	0	biology
 The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma .	1	biology
 The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .	0	biology
 1647 . Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments .	1	biology
 There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .	0	biology
 1650 . To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin , regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites .	0	biology
 Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .	1	biology
 Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .	0	biology
 1653 . ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) into acetyl and choline .	0	biology
 AChE resides in the synaptic cleft , breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors , which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1656 . Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .	1	biology
 The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	0	biology
 1659 . Short bones , or cuboidal bones , are bones that are the same width and length , giving them a cube - like shape .	1	biology
 For example , the bones of the wrist ( carpals ) and ankle ( tarsals ) are short bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1662 . Sesamoid bones are small , flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed .	1	biology
 The patellae are sesamoid bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1665 . Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems .	0	biology
 Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi , which transport blood . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .	1	biology
 1668 . Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones , spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones .	0	biology
 Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .	1	biology
 1671 . Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes .	0	biology
 Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei .	1	biology
 They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix .	0	biology
 1674 . Ossification , or osteogenesis , is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts .	1	biology
 Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification ; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones , it can also occur in other tissues .	0	biology
 1677 . Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone .	0	biology
 Until adolescence , hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate ( growth plate ) , which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1680 . In mammals , pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation ( breathing ) .	0	biology
 During inhalation , air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 As air passes through the nasal cavity , the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified .	0	biology
 1683 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 1686 . Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction ( parasympathetic ) or relaxation ( sympathetic ) in the bronchi and bronchioles , depending on the nervous system ’s cues .	0	biology
 In humans , bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles .	1	biology
 They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 1689 . In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .	0	biology
 At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .	1	biology
 Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli .	0	biology
 1692 . Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases .	1	biology
 The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture .	0	biology
 1695 . On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .	0	biology
 The expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 1698 . Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes .	0	biology
 The vital capacity ( VC ) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1701 . The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 Lastly , the total lung capacity ( TLC ) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the residual volume , expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1704 . In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .	1	biology
 The ratio of these values ( FEV1/FVC ratio ) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma , emphysema , and fibrosis .	0	biology
 If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high , the lungs are not compliant ( meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly ) , and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis .	0	biology
 1707 . The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs .	0	biology
 The lungs are elastic ; therefore , when air fills the lungs , the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs .	0	biology
 These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath .	0	biology
 1710 . The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .	1	biology
 Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .	1	biology
 1713 . There are two types of work conducted during respiration , flow - resistive and elastic work .	0	biology
 Flow - resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung , whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles , chest wall , and diaphragm .	1	biology
 Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow - resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles .	0	biology
 1716 . Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs .	0	biology
 Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance ( how elastic the lung is ) and resistance ( how much obstruction exists in the airways ) .	1	biology
 A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 1719 . Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema , asthma , and pulmonary edema .	0	biology
 In emphysema , which mostly arises from smoking tobacco , the walls of the alveoli are destroyed , decreasing the surface area for gas exchange .	1	biology
 1722 . There are two types of V / Q mismatch .	0	biology
 Both produce dead space , regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue .	1	biology
 Dead spaces can severely impact breathing , because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion .	0	biology
 1725 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .	0	biology
 Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red .	0	biology
 1728 . Increased temperature , such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle , causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced . Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood ’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen - carrying capacity .	0	biology
 In sickle cell anemia , the shape of the red blood cell is crescent - shaped , elongated , and stiffened , reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In this form , red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries .	0	biology
 1731 . Third , the majority of carbon dioxide molecules ( 85 percent ) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system .	0	biology
 In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	1	biology
 1734 . In all vertebrate organisms , as well as some invertebrates , this is a closed - loop system , in which the blood is not free in a cavity .	0	biology
 In a closed circulatory system , blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route , then returns to the heart again , as illustrated in [ link]a .	1	biology
 As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 1737 . As illustrated in [ link]a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two - chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle .	0	biology
 The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	0	biology
 1740 . The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .	1	biology
 In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .	0	biology
 1743 . The blood is more than the proteins , though .	0	biology
 Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma ( the liquid portion , which contains water , proteins , salts , lipids , and glucose ) and the cells ( red and white cells ) and cell fragments called platelets .	1	biology
 Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water , proteins , electrolytes , lipids , and glucose .	0	biology
 1746 . The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum .	1	biology
 Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves .	0	biology
 1749 . The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .	1	biology
 After it is filled , the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries , by - passing the semilunar valve ( or pulmonic valve ) to the lungs for re - oxygenation .	0	biology
 After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries , the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle .	0	biology
 1752 . The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .	0	biology
 The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1755 . The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .	1	biology
 They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .	0	biology
 The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 1758 . The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body ; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle .	0	biology
 The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax .	1	biology
 The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 1761 . The electrical signals and mechanical actions , illustrated in [ link ] , are intimately intertwined .	0	biology
 The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , which is located near the wall of the right atrium .	0	biology
 Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison .	0	biology
 1764 . The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs .	1	biology
 The major arteries diverge into minor arteries , and then smaller vessels called arterioles , to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body .	0	biology
 1767 . The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .	0	biology
 Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .	1	biology
 The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply .	0	biology
 1770 . The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava .	0	biology
 Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells .	1	biology
 The white blood cells remove infectious agents , such as bacteria and viruses , to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream .	0	biology
 1773 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 1776 . An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .	0	biology
 Both electrolytes and non - electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance .	0	biology
 1779 . Thus , one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams .	0	biology
 The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 1782 . When they move to a hypertonic marine environment , these fish start drinking sea water ; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 Most marine invertebrates , on the other hand , may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers ) .	0	biology
 Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration .	0	biology
 1785 . Externally , the kidneys are surrounded by three layers , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 1788 . The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	0	biology
 Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .	0	biology
 The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 1791 . The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .	0	biology
 The tips of the pyramids , called renal papillae , point toward the renal pelvis .	0	biology
 1794 . The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	0	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1797 . Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .	0	biology
 The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 1800 . The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .	0	biology
 Cortical radiate arteries , as the name suggests , radiate out from the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles , and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons .	1	biology
 1803 . The renal corpuscle , located in the renal cortex , is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule , a cup - shaped chamber that surrounds it , called the glomerular or Bowman 's capsule .	1	biology
 1806 . The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	1	biology
 The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids .	1	biology
 1809 . Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .	1	biology
 Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule .	0	biology
 In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	0	biology
 1812 . Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .	0	biology
 Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption .	1	biology
 In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network .	0	biology
 6717 . In the 1910s , Edith Bolling Wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband , President Woodrow Wilson , afflicted by a stroke , in the last years of his presidency .	0	government
 However , as the niece of one president and the wife of another , it was Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more .	0	government
 6726 . While running for the presidency for the first time in 1992 , Bill Clinton frequently touted the experience and capabilities of his wife .	0	government
 There was a lot to brag about .	0	government
 6729 . The president also exercises the power of pardon without conditions .	0	government
 Once used fairly sparingly — apart from Andrew Johnson ’s wholesale pardons of former Confederates during the Reconstruction period — the pardon power has become more visible in recent decades .	0	government
 6732 . These fears mingled with existing anti - Japanese sentiment across the country and created a paranoia that washed over the West Coast like a large wave .	0	government
 In an attempt to calm fears and prevent any real fifth - column actions , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 , which authorized the removal of people from military areas as necessary .	1	government
 When the military dubbed the entire West Coast a military area , it effectively allowed for the removal of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans from their homes .	0	government
 6735 . On the other hand , signing statements are statements issued by a president when agreeing to legislation that indicate how the chief executive will interpret and enforce the legislation in question .	1	government
 Signing statements are less powerful than vetoes , though congressional opponents have complained that they derail legislative intent .	0	government
 6744 . The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .	0	government
 So , for the most part , the Supreme Court is an appeals court , operating under appellate jurisdiction and hearing appeals from the lower courts .	1	government
 The rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of Congress .	0	government
 6750 . In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit . Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .	1	government
 However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .	0	government
 In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it . In an atmosphere of perceived weakness , the first chief justice , John Jay , an author of The Federalist Papers and appointed by President George Washington , resigned his post to become governor of New York and later declined President John Adams ’s offer of a subsequent term .

 6753 . If the courts find an action to be unconstitutional , it becomes null and void .	0	government
 Judicial review was established in the Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison , when , for the first time , the Court declared an act of Congress to be unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) . Wielding this power is a role Marshall defined as the “ very essence of judicial duty , ” and it continues today as one of the most significant aspects of judicial power .	1	government
 Judicial review lies at the core of the court ’s ability to check the other branches of government — and the states .	0	government
 6756 . President Adams had appointed William Marbury to a position in Washington , DC , but his commission was not delivered before Adams left office .	0	government
 So Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to use its power under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president ’s secretary of state , James Madison , to deliver the commission documents .	0	government
 It was a task Madison refused to do .	0	government
 6762 . The federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights .	0	government
 For example , when Samantha Elauf , a Muslim woman , was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company ’s dress code , the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated , making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages .	0	government
 6768 . In a number of cases , they have expressed reluctance to expand rights without limit , and they still balance that expansion with the government ’s need to govern , provide for the common good , and serve a broader societal purpose .	0	government
 For example , the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty , ruling that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider “ retribution and the possibility of deterrence ” when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it . Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153 ( 1976 ) .	1	government
 In other words , there is a greater good — more safety and security — that may be more important than sparing the life of an individual who has committed a heinous crime .	0	government
 6771 . Courts hear two different types of disputes : criminal and civil .	0	government
 Under criminal law , governments establish rules and punishments ; laws define conduct that is prohibited because it can harm others and impose punishment for committing such an act .	0	government
 Crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness ; felonies are the more serious crimes .	1	government
 6774 . The federal courts , on the other hand , will hear any case that involves a foreign government , patent or copyright infringement , Native American rights , maritime law , bankruptcy , or a controversy between two or more states .	1	government
 Cases arising from activities across state lines ( interstate commerce ) are also subject to federal court jurisdiction , as are cases in which the United States is a party .	0	government
 6780 . There are ninety - four U.S. district courts in the fifty states and U.S. territories , of which eighty - nine are in the states ( at least one in each state ) .	0	government
 The others are in Washington , DC ; Puerto Rico ; Guam ; the U.S. Virgin Islands ; and the Northern Mariana Islands .	0	government
 6783 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .	0	government
 Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .	1	government
 Beginning in 1789 when there were just thirteen , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system .	0	government
 6786 . The U.S. court system operates on the principle of stare decisis ( Latin for stand by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and tomorrow ’s rulings rely on what is decided today .	1	government
 Stare decisis is especially important in the U.S. common law system , in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself .	0	government
 6789 . At the federal level , the president nominates a candidate to a judgeship or justice position , and the nominee must be confirmed by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate , a function of the Senate ’s “ advice and consent ” role .	0	government
 All judges and justices in the national courts serve lifetime terms of office .	0	government
 6795 . Since their appointments , both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology .	0	government
 The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 has prompted the most recent discussion of appointing a new justice , with Obama nominating Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat .	0	government
 However , action on this nominee is unlikely given the election of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency .	0	government
 6798 . Sandra Day O’Connor , nominated by Republican president Ronald Reagan , often became a champion for women ’s rights .	0	government
 David Souter , nominated by Republican George H. W. Bush , more often than not sided with the Court ’s liberal wing .	0	government
 And even on the present - day court , Anthony Kennedy , a Reagan appointee , has become notorious as the Court ’s swing vote , sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not .	0	government
 6801 . For better or worse , sometimes it is only a controversial nominee who leaves a president ’s legacy behind .	0	government
 For example , the Reagan presidency is often remembered for two controversial nominees to the Supreme Court — Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg , the former accused of taking an overly conservative and “ extremist view of the Constitution”John M. Broder .	0	government

 6807 . The Supreme Court of the United States , sometimes abbreviated SCOTUS , is a one - of - a - kind institution .	1	government
 While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves , they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators , lawyers , and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system .	0	government
 6810 . With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .	0	government
 Had the Democrats retained the presidency in 2016 , the replacement for Scalia ’s spot on the court could have swung many key votes in a moderate or liberal direction .	0	government
 6813 . The Supreme Court begins its annual session on the first Monday in October and ends late the following June .	0	government
 Every year , there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the Supreme Court , but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the docket , which is the list of cases scheduled on the Court ’s calendar .	0	government
 The Court typically accepts fewer than 2 percent of the as many as ten thousand cases it is asked to review every year.“Supreme Court Procedures . ” United States Courts .	0	government

 Likewise , the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion ; however , any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion .	1	government
 If a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority ’s reasoning in it , that justice may write a concurring opinion .	1	government
 6834 . By 2002 , thirty - six states had repealed their sodomy laws , and most states were only selectively enforcing them .	0	government
 Changes in state laws , along with an emerging LGBT movement , no doubt swayed the Court and led it to the reversal of its earlier ruling with the 2003 decision , Lawrence v. Texas ( [ link]).Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558 ( 2003 ) .	0	government
 6837 . But the most significant check on the Supreme Court is executive and legislative leverage over the implementation and enforcement of its rulings .	1	government
 This process is called judicial implementation .	0	government

 6846 . The Constitution allocated more power to the federal government by effectively adding two new branches : a president to head the executive branch and the Supreme Court to head the judicial branch .	0	government
 The specific delegated or expressed powers granted to Congress and to the president were clearly spelled out in the body of the Constitution under Article I , Section 8 , and Article II , Sections 2 and 3 .	0	government
 6849 . In addition to these expressed powers , the national government was given implied powers that , while not clearly stated , are inferred .	0	government
 These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ” This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .	1	government
 Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level .	1	government
 6852 . Throughout U.S. history , the national and state governments have battled for dominance over the implementation of public policy and the funding of important political programs .	0	government
 Upon taking office in 1933 during the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) , President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a series of legislative proposals to boost the economy and put people back to work .	0	government
 The enacted programs allowed the federal government to play a broader role in revitalizing the economy while greatly expanding its power .	0	government
 6855 . Johnson declared a “ War on Poverty , ” instituting a package of Great Society programs designed to improve circumstances for lower - income Americans across the nation .	1	government
 The new programs included Medicare and Medicaid , which are health insurance programs for seniors and low - income citizens respectively , and the food stamp program , which provides food assistance to low - income families .	0	government

 Thus , increased diversity in state legislatures can have consequences for voter engagement and for the type of legislation pursued and passed within these bodies .	0	government
 6897 . Under consecutive term limits , a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate , most commonly eight years .	0	government
 To try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met , the member will have to wait to run for office again .	0	government
 6900 . Interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization .	0	government
 This same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials . See note above .	0	government
 This presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature ’s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions , such as oversight .	0	government
 6909 . The activities by which government achieves these functions include — but are not limited to — taxation , homeland security , immigration , foreign affairs , and education .	0	government
 The more society grows and the need for government services expands , the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes .	0	government
 Public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations .	0	government

 6924 . While the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century , it also underwent a very different evolution .	0	government
 Beginning with the Pendleton Act in the 1880s , the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system .	0	government
 The distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial .	0	government
 6930 . The classic model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal Weberian model , and it was developed by Max Weber , an early German sociologist .	0	government
 Weber argued that the increasing complexity of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services .	0	government
 6936 . Elected officials are regularly frustrated when bureaucrats seem not follow the path they intended .	0	government
 As a result , the bureaucratic process becomes inundated with red tape .	0	government

The act ’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi - juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints , conducts investigations into possible abuses , and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out . Campbell , “ Civil Service Reform , ” 100 .	1	government
 Over time , Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts .	0	government
 These include the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 , which further compelled federal agencies to protect whistleblowers who reasonably perceive that an institution or the people in the institution are acting inappropriately ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6948 . One approach to thinking about public policy is to see it as the broad strategy government uses to do its job .	1	government
 More formally , it is the relatively stable set of purposive governmental actions that address matters of concern to some part of society . James E. Anderson .	0	government
 6957 . Forests , water , and fisheries , however , are a type of public good called common goods , which are not excludable but may be finite .	1	government
 The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them , no one has a financial interest in protecting their long - term or future value .	0	government
 Without government regulation , a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water , since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else ( see [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6960 . In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .	0	government
 One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .	1	government
 6963 . While distributive policy , according to Lowi , has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits .	1	government
 A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society .	0	government
 6966 . A final type of policy is redistributive policy , so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another .	1	government
 That is , according to Lowi , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits .	0	government
 6972 . After completing a minimum number of years of work , American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age .	0	government
 It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group , and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment .	1	government
 The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings .	0	government
 6975 . Medicaid is a formula - based , health insurance program , which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category .	1	government
 Individuals in the Medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits , although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program ( it pays them less for services than does Medicare ) .	0	government
 6978 . A lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is AARP ( formerly the American Association of Retired Persons ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 AARP ’s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens , often through regulatory or redistributive politics .	1	government
 6981 . The policy process contains four sequential stages : ( 1 ) agenda setting , ( 2 ) policy enactment , ( 3 ) policy implementation , and ( 4 ) evaluation .	1	government
 Given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government , called the continuing agenda , and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time , it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process . Agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process .	0	government

 Roosevelt sought to implement a new approach to economic regulation known as Keynesianism .	0	government
 Named for its developer , the economist John Maynard Keynes , Keynesian economics argues that it is possible for a recession to become so deep , and last for so long , that the typical models of economic collapse and recovery may not work .	1	government
 Keynes suggested that economic growth was closely tied to the ability of individuals to consume goods .	0	government
 6990 . Portions of the budget not devoted to mandatory spending are categorized as discretionary spending because Congress must pass legislation to authorize money to be spent each year .	0	government
 About 50 percent of the approximately $ 1.2 trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government , including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings .	0	government
 6993 . As you would expect , Keynesians and supply - siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best .	0	government
 Keynesians , with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand , prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer ’s income increases .	0	government
 This policy leaves those most likely to spend their money with more money to spend .	0	government
 6996 . Financial panics arise when too many people , worried about the solvency of their investments , try to withdraw their money at the same time .	0	government
 Such panics plagued U.S. banks until 1913 ( [ link ] ) , when Congress enacted the Federal Reserve Act .	0	government
 The act established the Federal Reserve System , also known as the Fed , as the central bank of the United States .	1	government
 7002 . If the European continent was stable , so too was the world .	0	government
 During the Cold War era that followed World War II , stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable .	0	government
 Until approximately 1989–1990 , advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers .	0	government
 7005 . One of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world - level authority exists to mandate when and how the world ’s nations interact .	0	government
 After the failed attempt by President Woodrow Wilson and others to formalize a “ League of Nations ” in the wake of World War I in the 1920s , and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in 1929 , came World War II , history ’s deadliest military conflict .	0	government
 Now , in the early decades of the twenty - first century , it is common to think of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as the big game - changer .	0	government
 7011 . The balance of trade is the relationship between a country ’s inflow and outflow of goods .	1	government
 The United States sells many goods and services around the world , but overall it maintains a trade deficit , in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas .	1	government
 7014 . At the more serious end of the foreign policy decision - making spectrum , and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails , the U.S. military and defense establishment exists to provide the United States the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors .	0	government
 Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .	0	government
 Or it can be defensive , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , also known as Operation Desert Storm ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 1818 . This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types .	0	biology
 For example , the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa , which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells .	0	biology
 Together , the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex ( JGC ) .	1	biology

 Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore .	0	biology
 They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion .	0	biology
 1824 . Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body .	0	biology
 Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia , which raises the pH of body fluids .	0	biology
 The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system .	0	biology
 1830 . GoutMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells .	0	biology
 However , too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout , where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1833 . The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses .	0	biology
 Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology ; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response .	1	biology
 Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor - mediated signaling , and intricate cell - to - cell communication .	0	biology
 1836 . A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .	1	biology
 Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .	0	biology
 PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment .	1	biology
 1839 . A second class of early - acting cytokines is interferons , which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells .	1	biology
 One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication .	0	biology
 They also have other important functions , such as tumor surveillance .	0	biology
 1842 . Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .	1	biology
 An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite ; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes ( parasitic worms ) .	1	biology
 1845 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .	1	biology
 1848 . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .	1	biology
 NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .	0	biology
 MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non - nucleated .	1	biology
 1851 . Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse .	0	biology
 A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death , or apoptosis .	1	biology
 Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind .	0	biology
 1854 . The adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory .	0	biology
 Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination .	1	biology
 This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection .	0	biology
 1857 . The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens .	1	biology
 An antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection .	1	biology
 When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen .	0	biology
 1860 . These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC .	0	biology
 Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .	1	biology
 In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .	1	biology
 1863 . When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs .	0	biology
 The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection .	1	biology
 This phenomenon drastically , but briefly , changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen .	0	biology
 1866 . The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance .	1	biology
 Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .	0	biology
 1869 . A memory cell is an antigen - specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response , but that can immediately become effector cells upon re - exposure to the same pathogen .	1	biology
 During the primary immune response , memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses .	0	biology
 1872 . For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’s blood serum .	1	biology
 This phenomenon is called passive immunity ; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding , which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life .	0	biology
 1875 . Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region ( the surface area of about four to six amino acids ) , it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions .	0	biology
 Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion , but to a different antigen .	1	biology
 1878 . Thus , the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly .	0	biology
 Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .	1	biology
 1881 . As previously discussed , antidiuretic hormone or ADH ( also called vasopressin ) , as the name suggests , helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume , especially that of blood , is low .	1	biology
 It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary .	0	biology
 1884 . Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities .	1	biology
 The types of hypersensitivities include immediate , delayed , and autoimmunity .	0	biology
 1887 . Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .	0	biology
 Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies .	1	biology
 In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies .	0	biology

 After a period of growth , an organism splits into two separate organisms .	1	biology
 1893 . Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized .	1	biology
 The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid , depending on the process and the species .	0	biology
 1896 . There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization .	0	biology
 In oviparity , fertilized eggs are laid outside the female ’s body and develop there , receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg .	1	biology
 This occurs in most bony fish , many reptiles , some cartilaginous fish , most amphibians , two mammals , and all birds .	0	biology
 1899 . When they are released from the ovary , they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization .	0	biology
 Some insects have a specialized sac , called a spermatheca , which stores sperm for later use , sometimes up to a year .	1	biology
 Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival .	0	biology
 1902 . In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .	0	biology
 The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones .	1	biology
 Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm ( 1.5 by 1 in ) in size and divided into wedge - shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa .	0	biology
 1905 . These are the seminal vesicles , the prostate gland , and the bulbourethral gland , all of which are illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 The glands make a solution that is thick , yellowish , and alkaline .	0	biology
 1908 . The bulbourethral gland , or Cowper ’s gland , releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen .	1	biology
 It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine .	0	biology
 1911 . The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .	0	biology
 The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora .	1	biology
 These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra .	0	biology
 1914 . The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes .	1	biology
 It allows menstrual flow to leave the body .	0	biology
 1917 . When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .	0	biology

 3068 . ( See [ link ] . )	0	physics
 A carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station , say 1530 kHz , is varied or modulated in amplitude by an audio signal .	0	physics
 The resulting wave has a constant frequency , but a varying amplitude .	0	physics
 3071 . ( The entire FM radio band lies between channels 88 MHz and 174 MHz . )	0	physics
 These TV channels are called VHF ( for very high frequency ) .	0	physics
 Other channels called UHF ( for ultra high frequency ) utilize an even higher frequency range of 470 to 1000 MHz .	1	physics
 3074 . Since they have high frequencies , their wavelengths are short compared with those of other radio waves — hence the name “ microwave . ” Microwaves can also be produced by atoms and molecules .	0	physics
 They are , for example , a component of electromagnetic radiation generated by thermal agitation .	0	physics
 The thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above absolute zero causes them to emit and absorb radiation .	0	physics
 3077 . Visible light is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human eye responds .	1	physics
 Visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules , as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules .	0	physics
 3080 . Anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in electromagnetic waves .	0	physics
 Sometimes this energy is obvious , such as in the warmth of the summer sun .	0	physics
 3083 . Light may change direction when it encounters objects ( such as a mirror ) or in passing from one material to another ( such as in passing from air to glass ) , but it then continues in a straight line or as a ray .	0	physics
 The word ray comes from mathematics and here means a straight line that originates at some point .	1	physics
 It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays ( or even science fiction depictions of ray guns).Ray	0	physics
 3086 . In communications , it is used to transmit telephone , internet , and cable TV signals .	0	physics
 Fiber optics employs the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass .	1	physics
 Because the fibers are thin , light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and , thus , be totally reflected ( See [ link ] . )	0	physics
 3089 . What this implies is that white light is spread out according to wavelength in a rainbow .	0	physics
 Dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths .	1	physics
 More technically , dispersion occurs whenever there is a process that changes the direction of light in a manner that depends on wavelength .	0	physics
 3092 . [ link ] shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis ( the path taken by ray 2 in the figure is the axis of the lens ) .	0	physics
 The concave lens is a diverging lens , because it causes the light rays to bend away ( diverge ) from its axis .	1	physics
 In this case , the lens has been shaped so that all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point , FF size 12{F } { } , defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens .	0	physics
 3095 . The image formed in [ link ] is a real image , meaning that it can be projected .	1	physics
 That is , light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen , a piece of film , or the retina of an eye , for example .	0	physics
 3098 . When an optometrist identifies accommodation as a problem in elder people , it is most likely due to stiffening of the lens .	0	physics
 The lens of the eye changes with age in ways that tend to preserve the ability to see distant objects clearly but do not allow the eye to accommodate for close vision , a condition called presbyopia ( literally , elder eye ) .	1	physics
 To correct this vision defect , we place a converging , positive power lens in front of the eye , such as found in reading glasses .	0	physics
 3101 . The distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye ( normally infinity ) .	1	physics
 Farsightedness , or hyperopia , is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects may be clear .	1	physics
 A farsighted eye does not converge sufficient rays from a close object to make the rays meet on the retina .	0	physics
 3104 . Laser vision correction has progressed rapidly in the last few years .	0	physics
 It is the latest and by far the most successful in a series of procedures that correct vision by reshaping the cornea .	0	physics
 3107 . There are three types of cones , and each type is sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	physics
 A simplified theory of color vision is that there are three primary colors corresponding to the three types of cones .	1	physics
 The thousands of other hues that we can distinguish among are created by various combinations of stimulations of the three types of cones .	0	physics
 3110 . Each retinex forms an image that is compared with the others , and the eye - brain system thus can compare a candle - illuminated white table cloth with its generally reddish surroundings and determine that it is actually white .	1	physics
 This retinex theory of color vision is an example of modified theories of color vision that attempt to account for its subtleties .	0	physics
 One striking experiment performed by Land demonstrates that some type of image comparison may produce color vision .	0	physics
 3113 . The initial stage of the project is the construction of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder in Western Australia ( see [ link ] ) .	0	physics

 A range of rapidly changing distortions can be minimized by deforming or tilting the tiny lenses and mirrors .	0	physics
 3116 . Furthermore , Young first passed light from a single source ( the Sun ) through a single slit to make the light somewhat coherent .	0	physics
 By coherent , we mean waves are in phase or have a definite phase relationship .	1	physics
 Incoherent means the waves have random phase relationships .	1	physics
 3122 . There are specific directions for the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields .	0	physics
 Polarization is the attribute that a wave ’s oscillations have a definite direction relative to the direction of propagation of the wave .	1	physics
 ( This is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges . )	0	physics
 3125 . To examine this further , consider the transverse waves in the ropes shown in [ link ] .	0	physics
 The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized .	1	physics
 Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized .	0	physics

 In this chapter , we begin the development of quantum mechanics and its description of the strange submicroscopic world .	0	physics
 3146 . When light strikes materials , it can eject electrons from them .	0	physics

 One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters , such as those that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras .	0	physics
 3149 . A curve like this is obtained by detecting many photons , and it is apparent that the maximum energy is unlikely .	0	physics
 This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung ( German for braking radiation ) .	1	physics
 The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the anode material .	1	physics
 3152 . The range of photon energies for visible light from red to violet is 1.63 to 3.26 eV , respectively ( left for this chapter ’s Problems and Exercises to verify ) .	0	physics
 These energies are on the order of those between outer electron shells in atoms and molecules .	0	physics
 3155 . The quantum of EM radiation we call a photon has properties analogous to those of particles we can see , such as grains of sand .	1	physics
 A photon interacts as a unit in collisions or when absorbed , rather than as an extensive wave .	0	physics
 3158 . After compiling enough data , you get a distribution related to the particle ’s wavelength and diffraction pattern .	0	physics
 There is a certain probability of finding the particle at a given location , and the overall pattern is called a probability distribution .	1	physics
 Those who developed quantum mechanics devised equations that predicted the probability distribution in various circumstances .	0	physics
 3161 . Another is what Democritus in particular believed — that there is a smallest unit that can not be further subdivided .	1	physics
 Democritus called this the atom .	0	physics
 We now know that atoms themselves can be subdivided , but their identity is destroyed in the process , so the Greeks were correct in a respect .	0	physics
 3164 . Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment , as well as the mass of electrons , Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom .	0	physics

 3173 . Thus , typical x - ray photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects , like teeth , and produce sharp shadows ; however , since atoms are on the order of 0.1 nm in size , x rays can be used to detect the location , shape , and size of atoms and molecules .	1	physics
 The process is called x - ray diffraction , because it involves the diffraction and interference of x rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed for information about the structures that scattered the x rays .	0	physics
 Perhaps the most famous example of x - ray diffraction is the discovery of the double - helix structure of DNA in 1953 by an international team of scientists working at the Cavendish Laboratory — American James Watson , Englishman Francis Crick , and New Zealand – born Maurice Wilkins .	0	physics

 Holography is the process of producing holograms and , although they are recorded on photographic film , the process is quite different from normal photography .	1	physics
 3185 . The new insight is that the direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized .	0	physics
 The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called space quantization .	1	physics
 Like many aspects of quantum mechanics , this quantization of direction is totally unexpected .	0	physics
 3188 . That is , no two electrons can be in the same state .	0	physics
 This statement is known as the Pauli exclusion principle , because it excludes electrons from being in the same state .	1	physics
 The Pauli exclusion principle is extremely powerful and very broadly applicable .	0	physics
 3191 . The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .	0	physics
 A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) .	1	physics
 A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive . Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel ’s rays originate deep in the heart ( or nucleus ) of an atom .	1	physics
 3194 . The range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material .	1	physics
 Range is related to several factors , including the energy of the radiation , the material encountered , and the type of radiation ( see [ link ] ) .	0	physics

 3215 . The probability of finding a particle is related to the square of its wave function , and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier , which implies that the particle can tunnel through the barrier .	1	physics
 This process is called barrier penetration or quantum mechanical tunneling .	0	physics
 This concept was developed in theory by J. Robert Oppenheimer ( who led the development of the first nuclear bombs during World War II ) and was used by Gamow and others to describe αα size 12{α } { } decay .	0	physics

 612 . A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms .	0	biology
 A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism .	1	biology
 Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .	0	biology
 615 . A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type .	1	biology
 Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs , and the mRNAs encode proteins .	0	biology
 618 . Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .	1	biology
 The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .	1	biology
 Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics , as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors .	0	biology
 621 . The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false - negative results .	0	biology
 A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive .	1	biology
 In other words , many cases of cancer go undetected , which makes biomarkers unreliable .	0	biology
 624 . Traditionally , microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions , which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory .	1	biology
 Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours , their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly .	0	biology
 627 . Natural selection can only take place if there is variation , or differences , among individuals in a population .	0	biology
 Importantly , these differences must have some genetic basis ; otherwise , the selection will not lead to change in the next generation .	0	biology
 630 . However , the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures .	0	biology
 This phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry .	1	biology
 The two species came to the same function , flying , but did so separately from each other . These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs .	0	biology
 633 . Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with .	0	biology
 An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce , forming hybrids , is called a hybrid zone .	1	biology
 Over time , the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 636 . In the gradual speciation model , species diverge gradually over time in small steps .	1	biology
 In the punctuated equilibrium model , a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium , because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward .	0	biology
 639 . Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation : the formation of two species from one original species .	1	biology
 Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in On the Origin of Species ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 642 . Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories : dispersal and vicariance .	0	biology
 Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area , and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms .	1	biology
 645 . The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid .	1	biology
 The prefix “ allo- ” means “ other ” ( recall from allopatric ) : therefore , an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine .	0	biology
 648 . Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .	1	biology
 A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .	1	biology
 651 . Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place .	1	biology
 For example , male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females .	0	biology
 654 . Initially , the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur .	0	biology
 But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis — the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today .	1	biology
 In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .	0	biology
 657 . The allele frequency ( or gene frequency ) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population .	1	biology
 Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms , but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change .	0	biology
 660 . If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population , p + q = 1 .	0	biology
 In other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population . But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles , but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes , known as the population ’s genetic structure , from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes .	0	biology
 If the phenotype is observed , only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known ; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes .	0	biology
 663 . The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance .	1	biology
 When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .	0	biology
 666 . Over time , the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population , and the population will , as a result , grow larger on average .	0	biology
 That is , this would occur if this particular selection pressure , or driving selective force , were the only one acting on the population .	0	biology
 In other examples , better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure .	0	biology
 669 . Another important evolutionary force is gene flow : the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 While some populations are fairly stable , others experience more flux .	0	biology
 672 . Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations .	0	biology
 Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .	0	biology
 One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .	1	biology
 675 . An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( fecundity ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease , that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age .	1	biology
 Natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( Darwinian ) fitness .	1	biology
 678 . When the environment changes , populations will often undergo directional selection ( [ link ] ) , which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation .	1	biology
 A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth - century England .	0	biology
 681 . Males are often larger , for example , and display many elaborate colors and adornments , like the peacock ’s tail , while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration .	1	biology
 Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms ( [ link ] ) , which arise from the fact that in many populations , particularly animal populations , there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females .	0	biology
 That is , some males — often the bigger , stronger , or more decorated males — get the vast majority of the total matings , while others receive none .	0	biology
 684 . In 1915 , biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection : the Fisherian runaway model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference . In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring .	1	biology
 687 . Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor .	0	biology
 Scientists call such trees rooted , which means there is a single ancestral lineage ( typically drawn from the bottom or left ) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate .	0	biology
 Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya — diverge from a single point and branch off .	0	biology
 690 . A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .	1	biology
 693 . Taxonomy ( which literally means “ arrangement law ” ) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings .	1	biology
 Think about how a grocery store is organized .	0	biology
 699 . With the advancement of DNA technology , the area of molecular systematics , which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis , has blossomed .	1	biology
 New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms , but also uncover previously made errors .	0	biology
 702 . If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group , it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait .	1	biology
 The vertebrate in [ link ] is a shared ancestral character .	0	biology
 705 . Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parent(s ) to offspring .	1	biology
 These transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes , influencing their phenotypes .	0	biology
 708 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .	1	biology
 The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 711 . As shown in [ link]a , some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes , whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts .	1	biology
 This model is often called the “ web of life . ” In an effort to save the tree analogy , some have proposed using the Ficus tree ( [ link]b ) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.In the ( a ) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle , the “ tree of life ” arose from a community of ancestral cells , has multiple trunks , and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred .	1	biology
 Visually , this concept is better represented by ( b ) the multi - trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by Darwin [ link ] .	0	biology
 717 . All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .	1	biology
 The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .	0	biology
 Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “ spheres , ” whereas others are quite complex in structure . In general , the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups : filamentous , isometric ( or icosahedral ) , enveloped , and head and tail .	0	biology
 720 . Unlike nearly all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material , viruses may use either DNA or RNA as theirs .	0	biology
 The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus .	0	biology
 Viral genomes tend to be small , containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell .	0	biology
 723 . They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .	0	biology
 Group III viruses use dsRNA as their genome .	0	biology
 The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .	0	biology
 729 . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .	0	biology
 Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA , but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase , necessary for genome replication .	0	biology
 The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in [ link ] with examples of each group .	0	biology
 732 . These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .	1	biology
 Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .	1	biology
 The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .	0	biology
 735 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	0	biology
 738 . Sometimes , however , a virus can remain within the cell without being released .	0	biology
 For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .	0	biology
 When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .	1	biology
 741 . The viral genome is then “ injected ” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages .	0	biology
 Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors : receptor - mediated endocytosis , or fusion .	0	biology
 Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor - mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non - enveloped viruses .	0	biology
 744 . Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .	0	biology
 Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .	1	biology
 747 . When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear .	0	biology
 750 . While we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs , such as those used to treat HIV and influenza , the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination , which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses , killed viruses , or molecular subunits of the virus .	0	biology
 The killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease .	0	biology
 753 . The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non - viral diseases .	0	biology
 Viruses have been used in gene therapy .	0	biology
 Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) , a heritable , recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems .	1	biology
 756 . Prions and viroids are pathogens ( agents with the ability to cause disease ) that have simpler structures than viruses but , in the case of prions , still can produce deadly diseases .	1	biology
 759 . ViroidsViroids are plant pathogens : small , single - stranded , circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus .	1	biology
 They do not have a capsid or outer envelope , but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell .	0	biology
 762 . The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents .	0	biology
 A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth ’s surface that releases geothermally heated water .	1	biology
 With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago , some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source — sunlight — whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food .	0	biology
 765 . Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was anoxic , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen .	1	biology
 Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .	1	biology
 Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 768 . Other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles , meaning “ lovers of extremes . ” Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments : the depth of the oceans , hot springs , the Artic and the Antarctic , in very dry places , deep inside Earth , in harsh chemical environments , and in high radiation environments ( [ link ] ) , just to mention a few .	1	biology
 These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications .	0	biology
 771 . The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood .	0	biology
 In a process called resuscitation , the prokaryote can go back to “ normal ” life when environmental conditions improve .	0	biology
 774 . For example , the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces , protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells , and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses .	0	biology
 Some species also have flagella ( singular , flagellum ) used for locomotion , and pili ( singular , pilus ) used for attachment to surfaces .	0	biology
 Plasmids , which consist of extra - chromosomal DNA , are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea .	0	biology
 777 . Bacteria are divided into two major groups : Gram positive and Gram negative , based on their reaction to Gram staining .	0	biology
 Note that all Gram - positive bacteria belong to one phylum ; bacteria in the other phyla ( Proteobacteria , Chlamydias , Spirochetes , Cyanobacteria , and others ) are Gram - negative .	1	biology
 780 . In transformation , the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes .	1	biology
 If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome , it too may become pathogenic .	0	biology
 783 . Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers .	0	biology
 For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life , they need certain substances , collectively called nutrients .	0	biology
 When prokaryotes grow in nature , they obtain their nutrients from the environment .	0	biology
 786 . Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .	0	biology
 Then , bacteria and fungi , collectively called decomposers , carry out the breakdown ( decomposition ) of plants and animals and their organic compounds .	1	biology
 The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material ( dead animals , plants , and humus ) that undergo respiration .	0	biology
 789 . Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes , yielding N2 as the final product .	0	biology
 Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate .	1	biology
 Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas , Nitrobacter , and Nitrospira .	0	biology
 792 . An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .	1	biology
 A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 An endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present , usually at low incidence , in a population .	1	biology
 795 . Therefore , changes in the environment , the pathogen , or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease .	0	biology
 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) an emerging disease ( [ link ] ) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time , or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range .	1	biology
 This definition also includes re - emerging diseases that were previously under control .	0	biology
 798 . For example , Staphylococcus aureus , often called “ staph , ” is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics .	1	biology
 A very dangerous strain , however , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) has made the news over the past few years ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics , including methicillin , amoxicillin , penicillin , and oxacillin .	0	biology
 801 . Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .	0	biology
 In the past , it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism , the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum .	1	biology
 Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non - acidic canned foods , homemade pickles , and processed meat and sausages .	0	biology
 804 . Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free - living organisms by a factor of 10 .	0	biology
 Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules , specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Nitrogenase , the enzyme that fixes nitrogen , is inactivated by oxygen , so the nodule provides an oxygen - free area for nitrogen fixation to take place .	1	biology
 807 . In order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully , it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s ) of an alpha - proteobacterium that “ took up residence ” inside it .	0	biology
 This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis , one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit .	1	biology
 Over many generations , a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own .	0	biology
 810 . Protist cells may be enveloped by animal - like cell membranes or plant - like cell walls .	0	biology
 Others are encased in glassy silica - based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips .	0	biology
 The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor , preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion .	1	biology
 813 . Until recently , these protists were believed to lack mitochondria .	0	biology
 Mitochondrial remnant organelles , called mitosomes , have since been identified in diplomonads , but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional .	1	biology
 Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways , such as glycolysis , to generate energy .	1	biology
 816 . Together , the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates .	0	biology
 These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats , and are a component of plankton , the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms .	1	biology
 819 . Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually , although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist .	0	biology
 Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell , called a raphe .	0	biology
 By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe , the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction .	0	biology
 822 . Foraminiferans , or forams , are unicellular heterotrophic protists , ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several centimeters in length , and occasionally resembling tiny snails ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 As a group , the forams exhibit porous shells , called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate .	1	biology
 The tests may house photosynthetic algae , which the forams can harvest for nutrition .	0	biology
 825 . In addition , their mode of nutrition was poorly understood .	0	biology
 Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology : the scientific study of fungi .	1	biology
 Based on fossil evidence , fungi appeared in the pre - Cambrian era , about 450 million years ago .	0	biology
 828 . They display two distinct morphological stages : the vegetative and reproductive .	0	biology
 The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread - like structures called hyphae ( singular , hypha ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous .	1	biology
 The mass of hyphae is a mycelium ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 831 . The hyphae in bread molds ( which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota ) are not separated by septa .	0	biology
 Instead , they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei , an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae ( [ link]b ) .	0	biology
 834 . Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .	1	biology
 Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .	0	biology
 This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration , but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available .	1	biology
 837 . Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments .	0	biology
 They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium .	0	biology
 840 . Although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction , all include the following three stages ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 First , during plasmogamy ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , two haploid cells fuse , leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell .	1	biology
 During karyogamy ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus .	1	biology
 843 . The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota .	1	biology
 They include the familiar bread mold , Rhizopus stolonifer , which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads , fruits , and vegetables .	0	biology
 846 . In each ascus , two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy .	0	biology
 During sexual reproduction , thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp .	1	biology
 The diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis .	0	biology
 849 . Asexual Ascomycota and BasidiomycotaImperfect fungi — those that do not display a sexual phase — use to be classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota , , a classification group no longer used in the present , ever - developing classification of organisms .	0	biology
 While Deuteromycota use to be a classification group , recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota or the Basidiomycota classifications .	0	biology
 852 . Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .	0	biology
 It appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae : the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus , and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant . The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots .	1	biology
 Although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes , they do not form zygospores .	0	biology
 855 . Fungi can affect animals , including humans , in several ways .	0	biology
 A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage .	1	biology
 Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues .	0	biology
 858 . One of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae .	0	biology
 Mycorrhiza , which comes from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root , refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi .	1	biology
 Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners .	0	biology
 861 . Lichens display a range of colors and textures ( [ link ] ) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats .	1	biology
 They cover rocks , gravestones , tree bark , and the ground in the tundra where plant roots can not penetrate .	0	biology
 864 . In both seedless and seed plants , the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte .	1	biology
 This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes .	0	biology
 867 . After germinating from a spore , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia , usually on the same individual .	0	biology
 In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .	1	biology
 The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 870 . The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin .	1	biology
 This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids : hence the yellow color of most pollen .	0	biology
 873 . The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .	0	biology
 Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .	0	biology
 The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte .	1	biology
 876 . Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts , and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes .	1	biology
 Consequently , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta .	1	biology
 879 . The hornworts ( Anthocerotophyta ) belong to the broad bryophyte group .	0	biology
 They have colonized a variety of habitats on land , although they are never far from a source of moisture .	0	biology
 882 . The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground .	1	biology
 Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage - like structures .	0	biology
 885 . The vascular plants , or tracheophytes , are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants .	1	biology
 More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth ’s vegetation .	0	biology
 888 . Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it transports sugars , proteins , and other solutes throughout the plant .	1	biology
 Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the sieve elements .	0	biology
 891 . Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities .	0	biology
 Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins .	1	biology

 Atoms contain protons , electrons , and neutrons , among other subatomic particles .	0	biology
 53 . Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons .	0	biology
 The number of protons determines an element ’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .	1	biology

 62 . The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons .	0	biology
 This is known as the octet rule , which states , with the exception of the innermost shell , that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell , the outermost electron shell .	1	biology

 68 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	1	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	0	biology
 71 . Even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules ( each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom ) , in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds : they contain atoms of more than one type of element .	1	biology
 Molecular oxygen , on the other hand , as shown in [ link],consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule . The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond .	0	biology
 74 . In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .	1	biology

 Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise .	0	biology
 83 . This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’s electrons .	0	biology
 Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively .	0	biology
 Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus .	0	biology
 86 . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination .	0	biology
 Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules .	1	biology

 Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids .	0	biology
 Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 92 . Eventually , as water reaches its boiling point of 100 ° Celsius ( 212 ° Fahrenheit ) , the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules , and the kinetic energy ( motion ) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas .	0	biology
 Even when below its boiling point , water ’s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize : this process is known as evaporation .	1	biology
 95 . Before it overflows , the water forms a dome - like shape above the rim of the glass .	0	biology
 This water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion .	0	biology
 In cohesion , water molecules are attracted to each other ( because of hydrogen bonding ) , keeping the molecules together at the liquid - gas ( water - air ) interface , although there is no more room in the glass .	1	biology
 98 . This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it .	1	biology
 This type of adhesion is called capillary action , and is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology

 110 . Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	0	biology

 In a hypotonic situation , the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell , and water enters the cell .	1	biology
 ( In living systems , the point of reference is always the cytoplasm , so the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes , or a lower osmolarity , than the cell cytoplasm . )	0	biology

 Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen ; for this reason , epitopes are known as “ antigenic determinants . ” In the absence of information from APCs , T and B cells remain inactive , or naïve , and are unable to prepare an immune response .	0	biology
 1862 . When stimulated by the TH2 pathway , naïve B cells differentiate into antibody - secreting plasma cells .	0	biology
 A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies ; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens .	1	biology
 Similar to T cells , naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors ( BCRs ) , which are membrane - bound forms of Ig ( immunoglobulin , or an antibody ) .	1	biology
 1865 . Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue , which functions independently of the systemic immune system , and which has its own innate and adaptive components .	1	biology
 Mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , illustrated in [ link ] , is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body .	1	biology
 This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment .	0	biology
 1868 . The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .	1	biology
 In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens , other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response , which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self - antigens .	0	biology
 Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis .	0	biology
 1874 . The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined , multivalent structures ( such as IgM and IgA ) .	1	biology
 Although avidity measures the strength of binding , just as affinity does , the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure .	0	biology
 1877 . The renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , illustrated in [ link ] proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin II , which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume .	1	biology
 Renin ( secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex ) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles .	1	biology
 1880 . It also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex , which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium .	0	biology
 Angiotensin II also triggers the release of anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) from the hypothalamus , leading to water retention in the kidneys .	0	biology
 It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate .	0	biology
 1883 . Failures , insufficiencies , or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed .	0	biology
 Immunodeficiency is the failure , insufficiency , or delay in the response of the immune system , which may be acquired or inherited .	1	biology
 Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens ( such as HIV ) , chemical exposure ( including certain medical treatments ) , malnutrition , or possibly by extreme stress .	0	biology
 1886 . Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population .	1	biology
 Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .	0	biology
 1892 . Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration .	1	biology
 If the animal is capable of fragmentation , and the part is big enough , a separate individual will regrow .	0	biology
 1898 . In viviparity the young develop within the female , receiving nourishment from the mother ’s blood through a placenta .	1	biology
 The offspring develops in the female and is born alive .	0	biology
 1904 . Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions ( about 10 percent of the total ) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen ’s volume .	1	biology
 Sperm are haploid cells , consisting of a flagellum as a tail , a neck that contains the cell ’s energy - producing mitochondria , and a head that contains the genetic material .	0	biology
 1907 . The walnut - shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra , the connection to the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra .	0	biology
 1910 . The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .	1	biology
 The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .	1	biology
 The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .	0	biology
 1916 . In both sexes , the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland .	1	biology
 When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .	0	biology
 1922 . In addition , estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles .	0	biology
 Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth , ovulation , and calcium absorption ; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females .	1	biology
 These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .	0	biology
 1925 . Just prior to the middle of the cycle ( approximately day 14 ) , the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly , then fall .	0	biology
 The spike in LH causes ovulation : the most mature follicle , like that shown in [ link ] , ruptures and releases its egg .	1	biology
 The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost .	0	biology
 1928 . In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 In placental mammals , the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane , as illustrated in [ link]b .	1	biology
 1931 . In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .	0	biology
 Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .	0	biology
 1934 . Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual .	1	biology
 The length of time of gestation varies among animals , but is very similar among the great apes : human gestation is 266 days , while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days , a gorilla ’s is 257 days , and orangutan gestation is 260 days long .	0	biology
 The fox has a 57-day gestation .	0	biology
 1937 . The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control .	1	biology
 Strictly speaking , contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining .	0	biology
 Both terms are , however , frequently used interchangeably .	0	biology
 1940 . The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 In further development , the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord .	0	biology
 1943 . A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time .	1	biology
 ( Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics . )	1	biology
 A population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries : natural boundaries might be rivers , mountains , or deserts , while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass , manmade structures , or roads .	0	biology
 1946 . Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere .	0	biology
 The abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes : large areas of land with similar climate , flora , and fauna .	0	biology
 1955 . There is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low aboveground biomass .	0	biology
 The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost .	1	biology
 The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter , which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter .	0	biology
 1958 . The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .	1	biology
 1961 . The neritic zone ( [ link ] ) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m ( or 650 ft ) at the edge of the continental shelf .	1	biology
 Since light can penetrate this depth , photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone .	0	biology
 1964 . The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone , which is at depths of 4000 m or greater .	1	biology
 The abyssal zone ( [ link ] ) is very cold and has very high pressure , high oxygen content , and low nutrient content .	0	biology
 1970 . Because of this , they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds .	0	biology
 When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus ( from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms , for example ) , the growth of algae skyrockets , resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom .	1	biology
 Algal blooms ( [ link ] ) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water .	0	biology
 1973 . Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth .	1	biology
 Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves , stems , and flowers extending above the water ’s surface .	1	biology
 There are several types of wetlands including marshes , swamps , bogs , mudflats , and salt marshes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1976 . Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder - than - average temperatures that occurred on one day .	0	biology
 In contrast , weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time .	1	biology
 Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles .	0	biology
 1979 . This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide .	0	biology
 This led to haze - effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze - effect cooling usually extends for one or more years .	1	biology
 In Europe and North America , haze - effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784 .	0	biology
 1982 . Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates .	0	biology
 Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean .	1	biology
 When water warms , these chunks of ice melt and methane is released .	0	biology
 1985 . The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist , and how closely associated they are with each other .	0	biology
 Within a particular habitat , a population can be characterized by its population size ( N ) , the total number of individuals , and its population density , the number of individuals within a specific area or volume .	0	biology
 Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations .	0	biology
 1988 . In addition to measuring simple density , further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals .	0	biology
 Species dispersion patterns ( or distribution patterns ) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time .	1	biology
 In other words , they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart , and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart .	0	biology
 1994 . Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 Therefore , when calculating the growth rate of a population , the death rate ( D ) ( number organisms that die during a particular time interval ) is subtracted from the birth rate ( B ) ( number organisms that are born during that interval ) .	1	biology
 This is shown in the following formula :	0	biology
 1997 . The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits ( which we know now are transferred by genes ) to the next generation at a greater rate ( natural selection ) .	1	biology
 To model the reality of limited resources , population ecologists developed the logistic growth model .	0	biology
 2000 . In the real world , phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others .	0	biology
 The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition ( intra- = “ within ” ; -specific = “ species ” ) .	1	biology
 Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity — resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need .	0	biology
 2006 . In Müllerian mimicry , multiple species share the same warning coloration , but all of them actually have defenses .	1	biology
 [ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .	0	biology
 2009 . SymbiosisSymbiotic relationships , or symbioses ( plural ) , are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations .	1	biology
 Most scientists accept this definition , but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic , where both individuals benefit from the interaction .	0	biology
 2012 . A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .	1	biology
 In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .	0	biology
 2015 . The area in question could be a habitat , a biome , or the entire biosphere .	0	biology
 Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome .	1	biology
 Species richness varies across the globe ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2018 . Keystone SpeciesA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community ’s structure .	1	biology
 The intertidal sea star , Pisaster ochraceus , of the northwestern United States is a keystone species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2021 . On the Big Island , approximately 32 acres of land is added each year .	0	biology
 First , weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements , known as pioneer species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other , less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species .	0	biology
 2024 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .	0	biology
 2027 . Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli .	0	biology
 The simplest example of this is a reflex action , an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus .	1	biology
 To test the “ knee - jerk ” reflex , a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer .	0	biology
 2030 . A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed , the pattern goes on to completion .	1	biology
 An example of such a behavior occurs in the three - spined stickleback , a small freshwater fish ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2033 . Communication within a SpeciesAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals .	1	biology
 An example of this is seen in the three - spined stickleback , where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate .	0	biology
 2036 . Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish .	0	biology
 They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young .	1	biology
 2039 . In monogamous systems , one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season .	1	biology
 In some animals , such as the gray wolf , these associations can last much longer , even a lifetime .	0	biology
 2042 . Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure .	1	biology
 This is a form of non - associative learning , as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward .	0	biology
 2045 . In classical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with , the conditioned stimulus .	1	biology
 The response to the original , unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response .	1	biology
 2048 . A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime , such as how resources are allocated for growth , maintenance , and reproduction .	1	biology
 Life history traits affect the life table of an organism .	0	biology
 2051 . Single versus Multiple Reproductive EventsSome life history traits , such as fecundity , timing of reproduction , and parental care , can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species .	0	biology
 Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies .	1	biology
 Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event , sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive .	0	biology
 2054 . Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways .	0	biology
 These are grouped into density - dependent factors , in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality , and density - independent factors , which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density .	1	biology
 Note that in the former , the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset .	0	biology
 2057 . Furthermore , the theory ignored the age - specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important .	0	biology
 New demographic - based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and K - selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors .	0	biology
 2060 . In ecology , two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and resilience .	0	biology
 The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .	1	biology
 The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .	1	biology
 2063 . There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level .	1	biology
 Depending on their role as producers or consumers , species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels .	0	biology
 2066 . The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 2069 . A holistic model — which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment — is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems .	1	biology
 A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic , non - linear web of primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2072 . The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment ( disturbances ) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics .	1	biology
 Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies .	0	biology
 2075 . Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management : a conceptual model , an analytical model , and a simulation model .	0	biology
 A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem .	1	biology
 A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem ; however , its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited .	0	biology
 2078 . Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available , such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy .	0	biology
 2081 . In this ecosystem , the total energy accumulated by the primary producers ( gross primary productivity ) was shown to be 20,810 kcal / m2/yr . Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions ( like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss ) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem .	0	biology
 Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss .	1	biology
 The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level .	0	biology
 2084 . Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level .	1	biology
 Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .	1	biology
 Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food .	1	biology
 2087 . Geologic processes , such as weathering , erosion , water drainage , and the subduction of the continental plates , all play a role in this recycling of materials .	0	biology
 Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process , the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle .	1	biology
 2090 . Fossil fuels are considered a non - renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation .	0	biology
 A non - renewable resource , such as fossil fuel , is either regenerated very slowly or not at all .	1	biology
 Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .	0	biology
 2093 . A dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna ; these zones can be caused by eutrophication , oil spills , dumping of toxic chemicals , and other human activities .	1	biology
 The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years , and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008 .	0	biology
 2096 . Traditionally , ecologists have measured biodiversity , a general term for the variety present in the biosphere , by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness .	1	biology
 Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things .	0	biology
 2099 . Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts .	0	biology
 Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species .	1	biology
 2102 . All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria ; therefore , the 500 species of cichlids were endemic .	0	biology
 Endemic species are found in only one location .	1	biology
 Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction .	0	biology
 2105 . The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions , and a recent one .	0	biology
 It is well known that the North American , and to some degree Eurasian , megafauna , or large animals , disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period .	0	biology
 The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000–12,000 years ago .	0	biology
 2108 . Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area .	0	biology
 Most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as medication .	1	biology
 For centuries in Europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals — books that identified plants and their uses .	0	biology
 2111 . Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve .	1	biology
 Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena .	0	biology
 911 . The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant .	1	biology
 A whorl of sepals ( collectively called the calyx ) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud .	1	biology
 Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs , although there are some exceptions .	0	biology
 917 . The ovary houses one or more ovules , each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .	1	biology
 Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 920 . The other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm , which is tissue that serves as a food reserve .	1	biology
 The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle , or small root , and one ( monocot ) or two ( dicot ) leaf - like organs called cotyledons .	1	biology
 This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms : the monocots and the eudicots .	0	biology
 923 . Monocots include grasses and lilies , and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group .	0	biology
 Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups .	1	biology
 They are categorized separately in many classification schemes .	0	biology
 926 . Explore this website for additional information on pollinators . More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma .	1	biology
 Consequently , plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators .	0	biology
 929 . Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action , from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species .	0	biology
 Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .	1	biology
 Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .	1	biology
 932 . The first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period , about 319 million years ago ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms , the first naked seed plants , which arose about 380 million years ago .	1	biology
 Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers ( cone bearers ) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues ; however , they still reproduced like ferns , releasing spores into the environment .	1	biology
 935 . Seed ferns ( [ link ] ) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures .	1	biology
 What makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule — the female gametophyte and associated tissues — which develops into a seed upon fertilization .	1	biology
 Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period .	0	biology
 941 . Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .	0	biology
 After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells , a 6–32-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed .	1	biology
 Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .	1	biology
 944 . Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .	1	biology
 These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called organogenesis .	1	biology
 950 . Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers ( triploblasts ) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm , called a coelom , and those that do not .	1	biology
 This epithelial cell - lined coelomic cavity represents a space , usually filled with fluid , which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall .	0	biology
 953 . A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm , which is found between the two layers .	1	biology
 Although still functional , these are considered false coeloms , and those animals are called pseudocoelomates .	0	biology
 The phylum Nematoda ( roundworms ) is an example of a pseudocoelomate .	0	biology
 956 . The mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation .	1	biology
 In later stages , a second opening forms , and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 959 . The earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote .	0	biology
 Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage , meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated , and thus misaligned , with respect to the cells of the opposite pole .	1	biology
 This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .	0	biology
 962 . A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type .	0	biology
 In contrast , deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage , in which cells are not yet pre - determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types .	1	biology
 These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells .	0	biology
 965 . Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	1	biology
 Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae , and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore .	0	biology
 968 . The Cambrian Explosion of Animal LifeThe Cambrian period , occurring between approximately 542–488 million years ago , marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth ’s history .	1	biology
 It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time , often referred to as the Cambrian explosion ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Echinoderms , mollusks , worms , arthropods , and chordates arose during this period .	0	biology
 971 . The invertebrates , or invertebrata , are animals that do not contain bony structures , such as the cranium and vertebrae .	1	biology
 The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans , which include only the phylum Porifera : the sponges ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Parazoans ( “ beside animals ” ) do not display tissue - level organization , although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions .	1	biology
 974 . While sponges ( excluding the hexactinellids ) do not exhibit tissue - layer organization , they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions .	0	biology
 Pinacocytes , which are epithelial - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly - like substance called mesohyl .	1	biology
 Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen - like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions .	1	biology
 977 . In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 In other sponges , ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge . Choanocytes ( “ collar cells ” ) are present at various locations , depending on the type of sponge , but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows ( the spongocoel in simple sponges , canals within the body wall in more complex sponges , and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges ) .	1	biology
 Whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge , choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl .	1	biology
 980 . An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules .	0	biology
 Gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted .	1	biology

 [ link ] shows the organ systems of a typical plant .	0	biology
 1118 . Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1121 . Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base ; for example , it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing .	1	biology
 1124 . The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In stems , the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle ; in roots , this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder . This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash ( Curcurbita maxima ) stem .	1	biology
 Each teardrop - shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside .	0	biology
 1127 . The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .	1	biology
 The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .	1	biology
 1130 . Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 They provide structural support , mainly to the stem and leaves .	0	biology
 1133 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis .	1	biology
 1136 . Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 The ( a ) colorized scanning - electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot .	0	biology
 1139 . Phloem tissue is composed of sieve - tube cells , companion cells , phloem parenchyma , and phloem fibers .	1	biology
 A series of sieve - tube cells ( also called sieve - tube elements ) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube , which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids .	1	biology
 The sugars flow from one sieve - tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates , which are found at the end junctions between two cells .	0	biology
 1142 . Some plants , especially those that are woody , also increase in thickness during their life span .	0	biology
 The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth , and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem .	1	biology
 Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant , and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem .	1	biology
 1145 . The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 In some plants , the periderm has many openings , known as lenticels , which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex , xylem and phloem .	0	biology
 1148 . Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	1	biology
 Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .	1	biology
 Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 1151 . Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	1	biology
 A bulb , which functions as an underground storage unit , is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem , as seen in the iris .	1	biology
 1154 . Most roots are underground .	0	biology
 Some plants , however , also have adventitious roots , which emerge above the ground from the shoot .	1	biology
 1157 . When the plant embryo emerges from the seed , the radicle of the embryo forms the root system .	0	biology
 The tip of the root is protected by the root cap , a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure .	1	biology
 The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil .	0	biology
 1160 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 The endodermis is exclusive to roots , and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root ’s vascular system .	0	biology
 1163 . Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .	1	biology
 Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 1166 . Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 Most leaves have a midrib , which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue .	1	biology
 1169 . In an opposite leaf arrangement , two leaves arise at the same point , with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch .	0	biology
 If there are three or more leaves connected at a node , the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled .	1	biology
 1172 . Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology

 1178 . Transpiration — the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata — is a passive process , meaning that metabolic energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement .	1	biology
 The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere .	0	biology
 1181 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	0	biology

 Phytochromes have two photo - interconvertible forms : Pr and Pfr .	0	biology
 1190 . Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight .	1	biology
 Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism , whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism .	1	biology
 1193 . Apical dominance — the inhibition of lateral bud formation — is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem .	1	biology
 Flowering , fruit setting and ripening , and inhibition of abscission ( leaf falling ) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins .	1	biology
 Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red / far - red responses .	0	biology
 1196 . The plant hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls .	1	biology
 However , more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process .	0	biology
 1199 . Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections .	1	biology

 Managers embraced Fredrick Taylor ’s principles of scientific management , also called “ stop - watch management , ” where he used stop - watch studies to divide manufacturing tasks into short , repetitive segments .	1	history
 A mechanical engineer by training , Taylor encouraged factory owners to seek efficiency and profitability over any benefits of personal interaction .	0	history
 2406 . Urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the United States for a number of reasons .	0	history
 The new technologies of the time led to a massive leap in industrialization , requiring large numbers of workers .	0	history
 2409 . The primary form of relief for working - class urban Americans , and particularly immigrants , came in the form of machine politics .	0	history
 This phrase referred to the process by which every citizen of the city , no matter their ethnicity or race , was a ward resident with an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall .	1	history
 2412 . These included more expensive excursions , such as vacations in Newport , Rhode Island , winter relocation to sunny Florida , and frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe .	0	history
 For those who were not of the highly respected “ old money , ” but only recently obtained their riches through business ventures , the relief they sought came in the form of one book — the annual Social Register .	0	history
 First published in 1886 by Louis Keller in New York City , the register became a directory of the wealthy socialites who populated the city .	1	history
 4222 . Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .	1	psychology
 Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream , or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal .	0	psychology
 4228 . These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .	1	psychology
 People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .	1	psychology
 For example , the person who claims to be Jesus Christ , or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years , or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions .	0	psychology
 4231 . Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .	1	psychology
 In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .	1	psychology
 4234 . Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings : drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms ( Howes & Kapur , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia ( Snyder , 1976 ) .	1	psychology
 More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways .	0	psychology
 4237 . Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions .	0	psychology
 A new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis , such as unusual thought content , paranoia , odd communication , delusions , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are coined prodromal symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder .	0	psychology
 A number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of psychosis ) , recent deterioration in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of suspicion or paranoia , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( Fusar - Poli et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4240 . The term personality refers loosely to one ’s stable , consistent , and distinctive way of thinking about , feeling , acting , and relating to the world .	1	psychology
 People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture , is pervasive and inflexible , begins in adolescence or early adulthood , and causes distress or impairment ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact .	0	psychology
 4243 . People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .	0	psychology
 Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and obsessive - compulsive personality disorder ( which is not the same thing as obsessive - compulsive disorder ) .	1	psychology
 People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful .	0	psychology
 4246 . Mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also mania and elation ( Rothschild , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states , and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives .	0	psychology
 4252 . These subtypes — what the DSM-5 refer to as specifiers — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present .	0	psychology
 One subtype , seasonal pattern , applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or winter ) .	1	psychology
 In everyday language , people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues .	0	psychology
 4255 . A person with bipolar disorder ( commonly known as manic depression ) often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to unipolar , which indicates a persistently sad mood ) .	1	psychology
 4258 . If so , what might such predispositions be ?	0	psychology
 A study by Caspi and others ( 2003 ) suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin ( the 5-HTTLPR gene ) might be one culprit .	0	psychology
 These investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions .	0	psychology
 4261 . This theory , which focuses on rumination in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1987 ) .	0	psychology
 Rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms , rather that distracting one ’s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1991 ) .	1	psychology
 When people ruminate , they have thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotivated ?	0	psychology
 4264 . Obsessive - compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive , unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors .	0	psychology
 Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , craving double cheeseburgers when dieting ) , and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion ( e.g. , pacing when nervous ) .	0	psychology
 4267 . Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing , cleaning , checking ( e.g. , that a door is locked ) , and ordering ( e.g. , lining up all the pencils in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as counting , praying , or reciting something to oneself ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Compulsions characteristic of OCD are not performed out of pleasure , nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event .	0	psychology
 4270 . A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex ( Kopell & Greenberg , 2008 ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( Rushworth , Noonan , Boorman , Walton , & Behrens , 2011 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In people with OCD , the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which , for example , they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall ( Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischkel , & Kathmann , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 4273 . SPECIFIC PHOBIAPhobia is a Greek word that means fear .	0	psychology
 A person diagnosed with a specific phobia ( formerly known as simple phobia ) experiences excessive , distressing , and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , enclosed spaces , elevators , or flying ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational , some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) .	0	psychology
 4276 . The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning , such as modeling .	0	psychology
 For example , a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears , even though spiders have never presented any danger to him .	0	psychology
 4279 . People with panic disorder experience recurrent ( more than one ) and unexpected panic attacks , along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks , worry over the consequences of the attacks , or self - defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .	0	psychology
 4282 . Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened ( Bouton , Mineka , & Barlow , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , consider a child who has asthma .	0	psychology
 4285 . For centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective : attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding .	1	psychology
 Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits ( [ link ] ) ( Maher & Maher , 1985 ) .	0	psychology
 4288 . The diathesis - stress model ( Zuckerman , 1999 ) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder .	0	psychology
 This diathesis - stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder ( i.e. , a diathesis ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood maltreatment , negative life events , trauma , and so on .	1	psychology
 4291 . Such feelings would be normal .	0	psychology
 If you felt extremely depressed — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or sleeping , felt utterly worthless , and contemplated suicide — your feelings would be atypical , would deviate from the norm , and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Just because something is atypical , however , does not necessarily mean it is disordered .	0	psychology
 4294 . Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 According to the APA ( 2013 ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following :	0	psychology
 4297 . The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity ; the co - occurrence of two disorders .	1	psychology
 For example , the DSM-5 mentions that 41 % of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4300 . Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on temperament , the inborn , genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter .	0	psychology
 They believed personality is largely governed by biology .	0	psychology
 4303 . The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .	1	psychology
 Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4306 . Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing .	0	psychology
 This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud — projection — as a way to assess unconscious processes .	1	psychology
 5301 . In short , collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution .	1	sociology
 There are three primary forms of collective behavior : the crowd , the mass , and the public . It takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a crowd ( Lofland 1993 ) .	0	sociology
 Examples include a group of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert , tailgating at a Patriots game , or attending a worship service .	0	sociology
 5304 . Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .	1	sociology
 The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .	1	sociology
 5313 . Sociologist David Aberle ( 1966 ) addresses this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want .	0	sociology
 Reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure .	1	sociology
 Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .	0	sociology
 5319 . Resource Mobilization and the Civil Rights MovementAn example of resource mobilization theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the mid 1950s and the mid 1960s .	0	sociology
 Social movements had existed before , notably the Women 's Suffrage Movement and a long line of labor movements , thus constituting an existing social movement sector , which is the multiple social movement industries in a society , even if they have widely varying constituents and goals .	0	sociology
 The civil rights movement had also existed well before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man .	0	sociology
 5322 . The anti - gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman .	1	sociology
 Prognostic framing , the second type , offers a solution and states how it will be implemented .	1	sociology
 Some examples of this frame , when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti - gay marriage movement , include the plan to restrict marriage to “ one man / one woman ” or to allow only “ civil unions ” instead of marriages .	0	sociology
 5325 . New social movement theory , a development of European social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s , attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories .	1	sociology
 Rather than being one specific theory , it is more of a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics , identity , culture , and social change .	0	sociology
 5328 . Modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to a developed , technologically driven society ( Irwin 1975 ) .	1	sociology
 By this definition , the level of modernity within a society is judged by the sophistication of its technology , particularly as it relates to infrastructure , industry , and the like .	0	sociology
 5331 . Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists working from the micro - level study small groups and individual interactions , while those using macro - level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies .	0	sociology
 For example , a micro - level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals .	0	sociology
 5334 . Remember , though , that culture is a product of the people in a society ; sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “ culture ” as though it were alive in its own right .	1	sociology
 Reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real , material existence ( Sahn 2013 ) .	1	sociology
" 5340 . In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to "" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """	1	sociology
 He and other like - minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes , cultural norms , and societal values .	1	sociology
 This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict ( traditional in science ) , but to systematically gain an in - depth understanding of social worlds .	0	sociology
 5343 . Sociologists study social events , interactions , and patterns , and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do .	1	sociology
 In sociology , a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition , called a hypothesis , about society ( Allan 2006 ) .	1	sociology
 5346 . Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current , but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them ( Calhoun 2002).In sociology , a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life , and these are called paradigms .	1	sociology
 Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories , generalizations , and the experiments performed in support of them .	0	sociology
 Three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking , because they provide useful explanations : structural functionalism , conflict theory , and symbolic interactionism .	0	sociology
 5349 . He believed that to study society , a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashion , and rituals , which all serve to govern social life .	0	sociology
 Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .	0	sociology
 In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .	1	sociology
 5352 . Another noted structural functionalist , Robert Merton ( 1910–2003 ) , pointed out that social processes often have many functions .	0	sociology
 Manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated , while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process .	1	sociology
 A manifest function of college education , for example , includes gaining knowledge , preparing for a career , and finding a good job that utilizes that education .	0	sociology
 5355 . conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability .	0	sociology
 Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest . Symbolic Interactionist TheorySymbolic interactionism is a micro - level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society .	1	sociology
 Communication — the exchange of meaning through language and symbols — is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds .	1	sociology
 5358 . Sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions , such as these and more , about our social world . We often have opinions about social situations , but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data .	0	sociology
 Instead , scientific research is based on empirical evidence , which is evidence that comes from direct experience , scientifically gathered data , or experimentation .	1	sociology
 Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .	0	sociology
 5361 . A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .	1	sociology
 Sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method , or an interpretative framework , to increase understanding of societies and social interactions , but research begins with the search for an answer to a question .	0	sociology
 5364 . Sociologists do not rule out any topic , but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms . That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms .	0	sociology
 In a hygiene study , for instance , hygiene could be defined as “ personal habits to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might ask , “ How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ” When forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an operational definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it .	1	sociology
 The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept .	0	sociology
 5367 . In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .	0	sociology
 In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .	1	sociology
 The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .	1	sociology
 5370 . A researcher would n’t stroll into a crime - ridden neighborhood at midnight , calling out , “ Any gang members around ? ” And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency , the self - conscious , intimidated baristas might not behave naturally .	0	sociology
 This is called the Hawthorne effect — where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study .	1	sociology
 The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research .	0	sociology
 5373 . Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors ( such as sleeping , driving , or texting habits ) or factual information such as employment status , income , and education levels .	0	sociology
 A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .	1	sociology
 Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .	1	sociology
 5376 . For some topics , the researcher might ask yes - or - no or multiple - choice questions , allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question .	0	sociology
 This kind of quantitative data — research collected in numerical form that can be counted — are easy to tabulate .	1	sociology
 Just count up the number of “ yes ” and “ no ” responses or correct answers , and chart them into percentages . Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers — beyond “ yes , ” “ no , ” or the option next to a checkbox .	0	sociology
 5379 . They meet subjects where they live , work , and play .	0	sociology
 Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey .	1	sociology
 It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method .	0	sociology
 5382 . Ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting .	1	sociology
 Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community .	0	sociology
 5385 . While sociologists often engage in original research studies , they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis .	0	sociology
 Secondary data does n’t result from firsthand research collected from primary sources , but are the already completed work of other researchers .	1	sociology
 5388 . The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well .	0	sociology
 The ASA maintains a code of ethics — formal guidelines for conducting sociological research — consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline .	1	sociology
 It also describes procedures for filing , investigating , and resolving complaints of unethical conduct .	0	sociology
 5391 . In everyday conversation , people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society , but the terms have slightly different meanings , and the distinction is important to a sociologist .	0	sociology
 A society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture .	1	sociology
 By “ community , ” sociologists refer to a definable region — as small as a neighborhood ( Brooklyn , or “ the east side of town ” ) , as large as a country ( Ethiopia , the United States , or Nepal ) , or somewhere in between ( in the United States , this might include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society ) .	1	sociology
 5394 . cultural imperialism , the deliberate imposition of one ’s own cultural values on another culture .	1	sociology
 Europe ’s colonial expansion , begun in the sixteenth century , was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism .	0	sociology
 5397 . Values often suggest how people should behave , but they do n’t accurately reflect how people do behave .	0	sociology
 Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .	1	sociology
 But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .	0	sociology
 5400 . People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .	0	sociology
 Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions : good grades , for instance , may mean praise from parents and teachers .	0	sociology
 5403 . There are plenty of formal norms , but the list of informal norms — casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to — is longer .	1	sociology
 People learn informal norms by observation , imitation , and general socialization .	0	sociology
 5406 . Humans , consciously and subconsciously , are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world .	0	sociology
 Symbols — such as gestures , signs , objects , signals , and words — help people understand that world .	0	sociology
 They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies .	1	sociology
 5409 . In each pair , one type of entertainment is considered high - brow and the other low - brow .	0	sociology
 Sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society .	1	sociology
 People often associate high culture with intellectualism , political power , and prestige .	0	sociology
 5412 . Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures , which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture ’s norms and values .	1	sociology
 In contrast to subcultures , which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society , countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society .	0	sociology
 5415 . Inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts — when things are put together in an entirely new manner .	1	sociology
 In the late 1800s and early 1900s , electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace .	0	sociology
 5418 . Today , many U.S. companies set up offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper .	0	sociology
 When a person in the United States calls to get information about banking , insurance , or computer services , the person taking that call may be working in another country . Alongside the process of globalization is diffusion , or the spread of material and nonmaterial culture .	1	sociology
 While globalization refers to the integration of markets , diffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures .	1	sociology
 5421 . Roughly 7,500 years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants .	0	sociology
 Pastoral societies , such as the Maasai villagers , rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival .	1	sociology
 Unlike earlier hunter - gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive , pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food , clothing , and transportation , and they created a surplus of goods .	1	sociology
 5424 . The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies .	0	sociology
 These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection .	1	sociology
 5427 . He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’s actions .	0	sociology
 Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience .	1	sociology
 In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	0	sociology
 5430 . This type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a low division of labor created shared morals and values among people , such as hunter - gatherer groups .	0	sociology
 When people tend to do the same type of work , Durkheim argued , they tend to think and act alike . In industrial societies , mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity , which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences .	1	sociology
 In capitalist societies , Durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things .	0	sociology
 5433 . Marx ’s colleague and friend , Frederick Engels , wrote The Condition of the Working - Class in England in 1844 , which described in detail the horrid conditions . Such is the Old Town of Manchester , and on re - reading my description , I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated , it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth , ruin , and uninhabitableness , the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness , ventilation , and health which characterise the construction of this single district , containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants .	0	sociology
 And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England , the first manufacturing city of the world . Add to that the long hours , the use of child labor , and exposure to extreme conditions of heat , cold , and toxic chemicals , and it is no wonder that Marx and Engels referred to capitalism , which is a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products ( such as land , oil , factories , ships , etc . )	1	sociology
 are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government , as the “ dictatorship of the bourgeoisie . ” Karl Marx ( left ) and Friedrich Engels ( right ) analyzed differences in social power between “ have ” and “ have - not ” groups .	0	sociology
 5436 . In order for society to overcome false consciousness , Marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness , the awareness of one ’s rank in society .	1	sociology
 Instead of existing as a “ class in itself , ” the proletariat must become a “ class for itself ” in order to produce social change ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) , meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society , the class could become an advocate for social improvements .	1	sociology
 5439 . In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social Construction of Reality .	0	sociology
 In it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call habitualization .	0	sociology
 Habitualization describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern , which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort ” ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) .	1	sociology
 5442 . That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .	0	sociology
 For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially was n’t a part of his character . Like Berger and Luckmann in their description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation . ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K. Merton as a self - fulfilling prophecy .	0	sociology
 Merton explains that with a self - fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon .	0	sociology
 5445 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .	1	sociology
 Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .	1	sociology
 5448 . Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .	0	sociology
 If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .	1	sociology
 Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .	0	sociology
 5451 . Goffman ’s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of Charles Cooley and the looking - glass self .	0	sociology
 According to Cooley , we base our image on what we think other people see ( Cooley 1902 ) .	0	sociology
 5454 . A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .	1	sociology
 An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .	1	sociology
 Displaced persons have fled their homes while remaining inside their country ’s borders .	1	sociology
 5457 . Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .	0	sociology
 Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	1	sociology
 New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .	1	sociology
 5460 . As cities evolve from manufacturing - based industrial to service- and information - based postindustrial societies , gentrification becomes more common .	0	sociology
 Gentrification occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and renovate city areas that have been historically less affluent while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those neighborhoods for increasingly decaying portions of the city .	1	sociology
 Globally , 54 percent of the world ’s 7 billion people currently reside in urban areas , with the most urbanized region being North America ( 82 percent ) , followed by Latin America / the Caribbean ( 80 percent ) , with Europe coming in third ( 72 percent ) .	0	sociology
 5463 . The challenge for a human ecologist working in U.S. urban planning is to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty , while also figuring out how to provide for free - flowing transport of innumerable vehicles , not to mention parking !	0	sociology
 The concentric zone model ( Burgess 1925 ) is perhaps the most famous example of human ecology .	0	sociology
 This model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas , expanding outward from the center of the city , with various “ zones ” invading adjacent zones ( as new categories of people and businesses overrun the edges of nearby zones ) and succeeding ( then after invasion , the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants ) .	1	sociology
 5466 . The GCCI is a United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi - peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative , low - carbon , energy sources with financial incentives .	0	sociology
 Programming is organized around three pillars : ( 1 ) climate change adaptation , ( 2 ) clean energy , and ( 3 ) sustainable landscapes ( Troilo 2012).PollutionPollution describes what happens when contaminants are introduced into an environment ( water , air , land ) at levels that are damaging .	1	sociology
 Environments can often sustain a limited amount of contaminants without marked change , and water , air , and soil can “ heal ” themselves to a certain degree .	0	sociology
 5469 . Environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods ( populated primarily by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups ) are burdened with a disproportionate number of hazards , including toxic waste facilities , garbage dumps , and other sources of environmental pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life .	1	sociology
 All around the globe , members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution .	0	sociology
 5472 . To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .	1	sociology
 Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .	1	sociology
 The fertility number is generally lower than the fecundity number , which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of childbearing age .	1	sociology
 5475 . This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .	0	sociology
 The population composition includes the sex ratio , the number of men for every hundred women , as well as the population pyramid , a picture of population distribution by sex and age ( [ link]).This population pyramid shows the breakdown of the 2010 U.S. population according to age and sex .	1	sociology

 For example , a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience ( someone seats you , another takes your order , someone else cooks the food , while yet another clears away dirty dishes).Finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the generalized other , the common behavioral expectations of general society .	0	sociology
 By this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( Mead 1934 ; Mead 1964).Kohlberg ’s Theory of Moral Development	1	sociology

 5487 . In the process of resocialization , old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use .	1	sociology
 Resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center , goes to boarding school , or serves time in jail .	0	sociology
 5490 . School and classroom rituals , led by teachers serving as role models and leaders , regularly reinforce what society expects from children .	1	sociology
 Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum , the informal teaching done by schools .	1	sociology
 5493 . A rally is usually a one - time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party does n’t imply interaction with others .	0	sociology
 People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd .	1	sociology
 Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .	0	sociology
 5496 . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face - to - face in long - term emotional ways .	1	sociology
 This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones .	0	sociology
 The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization .	0	sociology
 5499 . A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement .	1	sociology
 In U.S. society , peer groups are common reference groups .	0	sociology
 5502 . Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .	1	sociology
 An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .	1	sociology
 We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .	0	sociology
 5505 . Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .	0	sociology

 5511 . Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories .	0	sociology
 Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests .	1	sociology
 As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way .	0	sociology
 5514 . A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .	1	sociology
 The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward .	1	sociology
 High school and the workplace fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money .	0	sociology
 5517 . The existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined , written down , and standardized .	1	sociology
 For example , at your college or university , the student guidelines are contained within the Student Handbook .	0	sociology
 5520 . While ostensibly based on meritocracy , bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths .	0	sociology
 Michels ( 1911 ) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the Iron Rule of Oligarchy , wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites .	1	sociology

 All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .	1	sociology
 The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .	1	sociology
 5526 . Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .	0	sociology
 Positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms .	1	sociology
 A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .	0	sociology
 5529 . Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .	0	sociology
 For example , wearing flip - flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands , whereas behavior that is seen as positive — such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street — may receive positive informal reactions , such as a smile or pat on the back . Formal sanctions , on the other hand , are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations .	1	sociology
 If a student violates her college ’s code of conduct , for example , she might be expelled .	0	sociology
 5532 . Cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower - class society causes crime .	1	sociology
 Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay ( 1942 ) studied crime patterns in Chicago in the early 1900s .	0	sociology
 5535 . In his book The Power Elite ( 1956 ) , sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he dubbed the power elite , a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources .	1	sociology
 Wealthy executives , politicians , celebrities , and military leaders often have access to national and international power , and in some cases , their decisions affect everyone in society .	0	sociology
 5538 . Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future . Sometimes , in more extreme cases , primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance .	0	sociology
 Secondary deviance occurs when a person ’s self - concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society .	1	sociology
 The person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a “ deviant ” as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such .	0	sociology
 5541 . Although deviance is a violation of social norms , it ’s not always punishable , and it ’s not necessarily bad .	1	sociology
 Crime , on the other hand , is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable through formal sanctions .	1	sociology
 Walking to class backward is a deviant behavior .	0	sociology
 5544 . Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .	0	sociology
 Nonviolent crimes involve the destruction or theft of property but do not use force or the threat of force .	1	sociology
 Because of this , they are also sometimes called “ property crimes . ” Larceny , car theft , and vandalism are all types of nonviolent crimes .	0	sociology
 5547 . Although these types of offenses rarely receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes , they can be far more damaging .	0	sociology
 Financial frauds such as insurance scams , Ponzi schemes , and improper practices by banks can devastate families who lose their savings or home . An often - debated third type of crime is victimless crime .	0	sociology
 Crimes are called victimless when the perpetrator is not explicitly harming another person .	1	sociology
 5550 . The U.S. Criminal Justice SystemA criminal justice system is an organization that exists to enforce a legal code .	1	sociology
 There are three branches of the U.S. criminal justice system : the police , the courts , and the corrections system .	0	sociology

 A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .	1	sociology
 Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( Conrad and Schneider 1992 ) .	0	sociology

 Stigmatization means their identity is spoiled ; they are labeled as different , discriminated against , and sometimes even shunned .	1	sociology
 They are labeled ( as an interactionist might point out ) and ascribed a master status ( as a functionalist might note ) , becoming “ the blind girl ” or “ the boy in the wheelchair ” instead of someone afforded a full identity by society .	0	sociology
 5580 . If sociology is the systematic study of human behavior in society , medical sociology is the systematic study of how humans manage issues of health and illness , disease and disorders , and healthcare for both the sick and the healthy .	1	sociology

 ( Strictly speaking , AD is what economists call total planned expenditure .	0	economic
 4926 . U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .	0	economic
 U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .	0	economic
 Thus , a higher domestic price level , relative to price levels in other countries , will reduce net export expenditures .	0	economic

 Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .	1	economic
 4932 . When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy , they tend to consume more .	1	economic
 If business confidence is high , then firms tend to spend more on investment , believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial .	0	economic
 Conversely , if consumer or business confidence drops , then consumption and investment spending decline .	0	economic
 4935 . During a recession , when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses , the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts .	0	economic
 During the recession of 2001 , for example , a tax cut was enacted into law .	0	economic
 4938 . In many of the national economies across Europe , the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10 % or a bit lower , even in good economic years .	0	economic
 This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market .	1	economic
 Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy .	1	economic
 4941 . Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side .	0	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy .	0	economic
 4944 . Because AD is volatile , it can easily fall .	0	economic
 Thus , even if we start at Yp , if AD falls , then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap .	0	economic
 The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .	0	economic
 4947 . Nondurable goods are things like groceries — once you consume them , they are gone .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy , like healthcare or entertainment . Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption :	0	economic
 4950 . Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items .	0	economic
 The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate .	0	economic
 Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital .	1	economic
 4953 . First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand .	1	economic
 We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed .	1	economic
 4956 . In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level .	1	economic
 For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales .	0	economic

 Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework .	0	economic
 4962 . The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation .	0	economic
 In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears .	0	economic
 Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift .	0	economic
 4965 . In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern .	0	economic
 The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left .	0	economic
 The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment .	0	economic
 4968 . The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?	0	economic
 This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .	0	economic
 Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run	0	economic
 4971 . Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done .	1	economic
 Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software .	0	economic
 4974 . Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical .	0	economic
 In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy .	0	economic
 4977 . Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work .	1	economic
 Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion .	1	economic
 After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later .	0	economic
 4980 . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation .	0	economic
 The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T]here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”	0	economic

 Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :	0	economic
 4989 . Economies without money typically engage in the barter system .	0	economic
 Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .	1	economic
 In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .	1	economic
 4992 . Second , money must serve as a store of value .	0	economic
 In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services .	0	economic
 4995 . Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future .	1	economic
 So money serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment .	1	economic
 4998 . As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome .	0	economic
 Countries moved towards the use of fiat money .	0	economic
 Fiat money has no intrinsic value , but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country .	1	economic
 5001 . There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .	1	economic
 Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .	0	economic
 5004 . For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	1	economic
 Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .	1	economic
 5007 . It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 Although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you .	0	economic
 When you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller , and at the end of the month , the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month .	0	economic
 5010 . Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets .	1	economic
 Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .	0	economic
 5013 . Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	1	economic
 All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool , which is then loaned out .	0	economic
 5016 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 For example , the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition .	0	economic
 5019 . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	0	economic
 A bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital .	1	economic
 A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults , monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to customers , and bonds .	1	economic
 5022 . The second category of bank asset is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and nonprofit organizations .	1	economic
 A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the U.S. government .	0	economic
 5025 . The bank will be more willing to make what are called “ subprime loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down - payment , little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that .	1	economic
 Some subprime loans made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income , No Job , or Assets . These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities — but with a twist .	0	economic
 The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage - backed securities , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , 5 % of such losses .	0	economic
 5028 . Fortunately , a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system .	0	economic
 The money multiplier formula is :	0	economic
 5031 . Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England .	0	economic
 In the United States , the central bank is called the Federal Reserve — often abbreviated as just “ the Fed . ” This section explains the organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank .	1	economic
 5034 . Bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk .	1	economic
 Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .	0	economic
 5037 . They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .	1	economic
 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .	0	economic
 5040 . In this situation , whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough , lost their money .	0	economic
 Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run .	1	economic
 In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .	0	economic
 5043 . To prevent this , the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else .	1	economic
 This is known as the lender of last resort role .	0	economic
 For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money .	0	economic
 5046 . The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations .	1	economic
 The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors .	0	economic
 5049 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5052 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 5055 . If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential GDP , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .	0	economic
 5058 . [ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades .	0	economic
 The graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market operations ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since 1975 .	0	economic
 Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure .	0	economic
 5061 . Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .	0	economic
 First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills .	1	economic
 In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .	0	economic
 5064 . If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans .	0	economic
 Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .	0	economic
 The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .	0	economic
 5067 . Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used .	0	economic
 Consider the velocity of M1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances .	0	economic
 In 2009 , for example , M1 was $ 1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $ 14.3 trillion , so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ( $ 14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion ) .	0	economic
 5070 . This equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form .	0	economic
 This equation must hold true , by definition .	0	economic
 5073 . In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate .	0	economic
 These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central bankers , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects .	0	economic
 5076 . This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low .	1	economic
 By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .	0	economic
 5079 . One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .	0	economic
 For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .	1	economic
 The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .	0	economic
 5082 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 In good economic times , this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth .	0	economic
 5085 . Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor .	0	economic
 For example , Ecuador , El Salvador , and Panama have decided to dollarize — that is , to use the U.S. dollar as their currency .	1	economic
 Sometimes nations share a common currency .	0	economic
 5088 . In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa .	0	economic
 To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership .	0	economic
 Let ’s consider these categories in turn .	0	economic
 5091 . Let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is .	0	economic
 You can hedge , which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) .	1	economic
 Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time .	0	economic
 5094 . When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different .	0	economic
 When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening.”To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) .	1	economic
 The vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ 1 in U.S. currency , measured in terms of Canadian currency .	0	economic
 5097 . In the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars .	0	economic
 What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ?	0	economic
 The answer to this question is discussed in the following section .	0	economic
 5100 . The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods .	1	economic
 5103 . Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency .	0	economic
 As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole .	0	economic
 5106 . Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers .	0	economic
 When most of a country ’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously , a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results .	0	economic
 Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy .	0	economic
 5109 . In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % .	0	economic
 ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS ) The line 's variations represent the volatility of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5112 . A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies .	0	economic
 5115 . Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation .	0	economic
 Alternatively , Brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 5118 . Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market .	0	economic
 If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .	0	economic
 Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .	0	economic
 5121 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .	1	economic
 For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .	0	economic
 5124 . A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency .	1	economic
 A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether .	0	economic
 5127 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	1	economic
 All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government .	0	economic
 5130 . Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes .	0	economic
 5133 . Together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80 % of federal tax revenues in 2014 .	0	economic
 Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases .	1	economic
 Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .	0	economic
 5136 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5139 . As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts .	0	economic
 These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .	0	economic
 5142 . Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .	0	economic
 5145 . The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom .	1	economic
 5148 . Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates .	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % .	1	economic
 5151 . Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time .	0	economic
 The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag .	1	economic
 Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .	0	economic
 5154 . Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities .	0	economic
 The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy .	1	economic
 5157 . The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal .	0	economic
 However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit .	0	economic
 For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits .	0	economic
 5160 . How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP .	0	economic
 However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 .	0	economic
 5163 . If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment . However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity .	0	economic
 5166 . The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772–1823 ) .	1	economic
 If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .	0	economic
 5169 . First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey .	0	economic
 If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros . The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession .	0	economic
 Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997–1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 .	0	economic
 5172 . For example , life expectancy at birth in many low - income regions approximates those who are more affluent .	0	economic
 The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living .	0	economic
 For instance , despite very high income levels , there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America .	0	economic
 5175 . The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore .	1	economic
 The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan , although these are often treated under international law as part of China , rather than as separate countries .	0	economic
 5178 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .	0	economic
 The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5181 . In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution . However , the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp .	0	economic
 5184 . Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent .	0	economic
 It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies .	1	economic
 5187 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports exceed its exports .	0	economic
 In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .	0	economic
 5190 . It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , shifting the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left .	0	economic
 The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession .	0	economic
 People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy , with its great size , is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets .	0	economic
 5193 . World War I severed many economic connections .	0	economic
 During the Great Depression of the 1930s , many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others .	0	economic
 World War II further hindered international trade .	0	economic
 5196 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .	0	economic
 The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .	0	economic
 5199 . The United States produces / consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn .	0	economic
 Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .	0	economic
 With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .	0	economic
 5202 . Then , in the numerical example given , Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators .	0	economic
 Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade .	0	economic
 Mexico will be unambiguously better off .	0	economic
 5205 . What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?	0	economic
 There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale .	0	economic
 5208 . A second broad reason that intra - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale .	0	economic
 The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens .	0	economic
 5211 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .	1	economic
 Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .	0	economic
 Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .	0	economic
 5214 . Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services .	0	economic
 They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .	0	economic
 5217 . ( We ’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter . )	0	economic
 This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world .	0	economic
 It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , quotas , and nontariff barriers .	1	economic
 0 . What is biology ?	0	biology
 In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments .	1	biology
 This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast .	0	biology
 3 . The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments .	0	biology
 A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested .	1	biology
 Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is .	0	biology
 6 . For some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics .	0	biology
 Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry .	1	biology
 Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary .	0	biology
 9 . Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science .	0	biology
 Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested . The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches .	1	biology
 18 . The introduction starts with brief , but broad , background information about what is known in the field .	1	biology
 A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work ; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented .	0	biology
 21 . Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both .	0	biology
 If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections , the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation .	1	biology
 The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .	0	biology
 27 . Atoms form molecules .	0	biology
 A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .	1	biology
 Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .	1	biology
 30 . Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts , which carry out indispensable functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars .	0	biology
 All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms .	1	biology
 ( This requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells .	0	biology
 33 . In larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions .	1	biology
 Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function .	1	biology
 Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .	0	biology
 36 . All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population .	1	biology
 For example , a forest may include many pine trees .	0	biology
 39 . An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic , non - living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water .	1	biology
 At the highest level of organization ( [ link ] ) , the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems , and it represents the zones of life on earth .	1	biology
 It includes land , water , and even the atmosphere to a certain extent . Art ConnectionThe biological levels of organization of living things are shown .	0	biology
 42 . Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field .	0	biology
 For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .	0	biology
 Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .	1	biology
 45 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .	0	biology
 48 . Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass .	1	biology
 Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions .	1	biology
 There are 118 elements , but only 92 occur naturally .	0	biology
 51 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge .	0	biology
 A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged .	0	biology
 Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .	0	biology
 54 . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .	0	biology
 Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number .	0	biology
 63 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms .	0	biology
 Their non - reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases ( or noble gases ) .	0	biology
 Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left - hand column .	0	biology
 66 . Two electrons fill the 1s orbital , and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital .	0	biology
 Its electron configuration is 1s22s1 .	0	biology
 Neon ( Ne ) , on the other hand , has a total of ten electrons : two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell ( two each in the 2s and three p orbitals ) ; thus , it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms .	0	biology
 69 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	0	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	1	biology
 An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction ; this direction is not always a “ one - way street . ” For the creation of the water molecule shown above , the chemical equation would be :	0	biology
 72 . Some chemical reactions , such as the one shown above , can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up .	0	biology
 The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .	0	biology
 Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .	0	biology
 78 . This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer .	1	biology
 As [ link ] illustrates , sodium ( Na ) only has one electron in its outer electron shell .	0	biology
 84 . Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally .	1	biology
 For example , molecular oxygen ( O2 ) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms .	0	biology
 87 . Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions .	0	biology
 A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -philic = “ loving ” ) .	1	biology
 In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .	0	biology
 90 . Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 For water , this amount is one calorie .	0	biology
 It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool .	0	biology
 93 . Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it .	0	biology
 Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds .	1	biology
 The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .	0	biology
 96 . Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress .	1	biology
 This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity .	0	biology
 99 . litmus or pH paper , filter paper that has been treated with a natural water - soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator , to test how much acid ( acidity ) or base ( alkalinity ) exists in a solution .	1	biology
 You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated .	0	biology
 102 . The pH scale is , as previously mentioned , an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Anything below 7.0 ( ranging from 0.0 to 6.9 ) is acidic , and anything above 7.0 ( from 7.1 to 14.0 ) is alkaline .	0	biology
 105 . Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen , such as methane ( CH4 ) described above .	1	biology
 We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels — like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter .	0	biology
 108 . The three - dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry .	0	biology
 Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .	1	biology
 Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	1	biology
 111 . Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three - dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images .	1	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , an amino acid alanine example , the two structures are non - superimposable .	0	biology
 114 . As you ’ve learned , biological macromolecules are large molecules , necessary for life , that are built from smaller organic molecules .	1	biology
 There are four major classes of biological macromolecules ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids ) ; each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions .	0	biology
 120 . Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula ( CH2O)n , where n is the number of carbons in the molecule .	0	biology
 In other words , the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules .	0	biology
 126 . Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer .	1	biology
 The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose ; this provides structural support to the cell .	0	biology
 129 . The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar .	0	biology
 Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure .	0	biology
 Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .	0	biology
 132 . Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond .	0	biology
 If hydrogens are present in the same plane , it is referred to as a cis fat ; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes , it is referred to as a trans fat .	0	biology
 The cis double bond causes a bend or a “ kink ” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly , keeping them liquid at room temperature ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 135 . Phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane , the outermost layer of animal cells .	1	biology
 Like fats , they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone .	0	biology
 141 . Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins .	1	biology
 Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure , which consists of a central carbon atom , also known as the alpha ( α ) carbon , bonded to an amino group ( NH2 ) , a carboxyl group ( COOH ) , and to a hydrogen atom .	0	biology
 144 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .	0	biology
 The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 147 . In nature , some proteins are formed from several polypeptides , also known as subunits , and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure .	0	biology
 Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure .	0	biology
 150 . The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .	0	biology
 DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms , ranging from single - celled bacteria to multicellular mammals .	1	biology
 153 . DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides .	0	biology
 The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide , DNA or RNA .	0	biology
 Each nucleotide is made up of three components : a nitrogenous base , a pentose ( five - carbon ) sugar , and a phosphate group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 156 . The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ ( 1′ is read as “ one prime ” ) .	0	biology
 The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide , which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage .	0	biology
 The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules : its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups .	0	biology
 159 . As you have learned , information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein .	0	biology
 DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription , and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation .	1	biology
 This is known as the Central Dogma of Life , which holds true for all organisms ; however , exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections .	0	biology
 162 . In contrast to light microscopes , electron microscopes ( [ link]b ) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light .	1	biology
 Not only does this allow for higher magnification and , thus , more detail ( [ link ] ) , it also provides higher resolving power .	0	biology
 165 . We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes .	0	biology
 Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of the cell : the nucleoid ( [ link]).This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell .	1	biology
 All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid , ribosomes , a cell membrane , and a cell wall .	0	biology
 168 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .	1	biology
 It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 171 . The nuclear envelope is a double - membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers .	0	biology
 174 . When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle , proteins are attached to chromosomes , and they resemble an unwound , jumbled bunch of threads .	0	biology
 These unwound protein - chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( [ link ] ) ; chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed .	1	biology
 177 . Mitochondria ( singular = mitochondrion ) are often called the “ powerhouses ” or “ energy factories ” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the cell ’s main energy - carrying molecule .	0	biology
 ATP represents the short - term stored energy of the cell .	1	biology
 180 . The centrosome is a microtubule - organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells .	1	biology
 It contains a pair of centrioles , two structures that lie perpendicular to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 183 . Like the mitochondria , chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes , but chloroplasts have an entirely different function .	0	biology
 Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis .	1	biology
 Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide , water , and light energy to make glucose and oxygen .	1	biology
 186 . Within the cytoplasm , there would still be ions and organic molecules , plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell , secure some organelles in specific positions , allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell , and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move .	1	biology
 Collectively , this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton : microfilaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 189 . The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of α - tubulin and β - tubulin , two globular proteins ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 With a diameter of about 25 nm , microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 They help the cell resist compression , provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell , and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell .	0	biology
 192 . Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate - containing protein molecules called proteoglycans .	1	biology
 Collectively , these materials are called the extracellular matrix ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue , but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other .	0	biology
 195 . Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes , which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes .	1	biology
 198 . The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid .	0	biology
 Carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins , forming glycoproteins , or attached to lipids , forming glycolipids .	0	biology
 201 . The head can form hydrogen bonds , but the tail can not .	0	biology
 A molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged , or non - polar , area is referred to as amphiphilic or “ dual - loving . ”	1	biology
 204 . Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell , and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving .	0	biology
 In other words , plasma membranes are selectively permeable — they allow some substances to pass through , but not others .	1	biology
 If they were to lose this selectivity , the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself , and it would be destroyed .	0	biology
 207 . Diffusion is a passive process of transport .	1	biology
 A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space .	0	biology
 210 . The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins , and they function as either channels for the material or carriers .	1	biology
 In both cases , they are transmembrane proteins .	0	biology
 213 . Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein .	0	biology
 This aptly named protein binds a substance and , in doing so , triggers a change of its own shape , moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ( [ link ] ) ; depending on the gradient , the material may move in the opposite direction .	0	biology
 216 . Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis .	1	biology
 A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .	0	biology
 219 . As for a hypertonic solution , the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does .	1	biology
 Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell .	0	biology
 222 . Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .	1	biology
 If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance .	0	biology
 225 . Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules .	0	biology
 Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .	1	biology
 Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .	0	biology
 228 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	1	biology
 231 . This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process .	0	biology
 The sodium - potassium pump is , therefore , an electrogenic pump ( a pump that creates a charge imbalance ) , creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential .	1	biology
 234 . A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis .	0	biology
 This literally means “ cell drinking ” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid .	0	biology
 237 . In receptor - mediated endocytosis , as in phagocytosis , clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor - mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective , the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood .	0	biology
 240 . Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used , cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy - requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place .	0	biology
 All of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells , including those that use energy and those that release energy , are the cell ’s metabolism .	1	biology
 243 . Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter .	1	biology
 The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system , and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings .	0	biology
 246 . However , a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work .	0	biology
 Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy .	1	biology
 A speeding bullet , a walking person , the rapid movement of molecules in the air ( which produces heat ) , and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy .	0	biology
 249 . How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction ?	0	biology
 A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers .	0	biology
 Free energy is called Gibbs free energy ( abbreviated with the letter G ) after Josiah Willard Gibbs , the scientist who developed the measurement .	0	biology
 252 . Thus , the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy - storing molecules .	0	biology
 These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions , and they are non - spontaneous .	1	biology
 An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy .	0	biology
 255 . The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings .	0	biology
 Heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) speeds up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they collide ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their transition state .	1	biology
 For this reason , heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently .	0	biology
 258 . The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme ’s substrates .	1	biology
 There may be one or more substrates , depending on the particular chemical reaction .	0	biology
 261 . This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step .	0	biology
 However , current research supports a more refined view called induced fit ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The induced - fit model expands upon the lock - and - key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate .	1	biology
 264 . Many enzymes do n’t work optimally , or even at all , unless bound to other specific non - protein helper molecules , either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds .	0	biology
 Two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes .	0	biology
 Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes .	0	biology
 267 . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable .	0	biology
 The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP , a process called dephosphorylation , releases energy .	1	biology
 270 . Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism , however , is derived from a much more complex process , chemiosmosis , which takes place in mitochondria ( [ link ] ) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell .	0	biology
 Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .	1	biology
 The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .	0	biology
 273 . Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism .	0	biology
 The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic .	1	biology
 Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells .	0	biology
 276 . If the cell can not catabolize the pyruvate molecules further , it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose .	0	biology
 Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration — the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen — and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP .	1	biology
 If glycolysis is interrupted , these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium - potassium pumps , and eventually , they die .	0	biology
 279 . As the protein passes along the Golgi ’s cisternae , it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates .	0	biology
 After its synthesis is complete , it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the Golgi ’s trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane .	0	biology

 282 . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( SER ) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates , lipids , and steroid hormones ; detoxification of medications and poisons ; and storage of calcium ions .	0	biology
 285 . Complex II directly receives FADH2 , which does not pass through complex I .	0	biology
 The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone ( Q ) .	1	biology
 The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane .	0	biology
 288 . In contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor .	0	biology
 Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen .	0	biology
 291 . Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .	1	biology
 A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as chemoautotrophs .	1	biology
 294 . The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss .	0	biology
 Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes . In all autotrophic eukaryotes , photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast .	0	biology
 For plants , chloroplast - containing cells exist in the mesophyll .	0	biology
 297 . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .	1	biology
 The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .	0	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis).Art Connection	1	biology
 6110 . Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .	0	government
 In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .	1	government
 However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .	0	government
 In particular , the concept of “ contemporary community standards ” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place ; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive .	0	government
 6113 . Free expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials .	0	government
 This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent , such as American Nazis and the vehemently anti - gay Westboro Baptist Church , whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror ( [ link]).National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie , 432 U.S. 43 ( 1977 ) ; Snyder v. Phelps , 562 U.S. 443 ( 2011 ) .	0	government
 Free expression — although a broad right — is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order .	0	government
 In particular , the nature , place , and timing of protests — but not their substantive content — are subject to reasonable limits .	0	government
 6116 . In the meantime , as part of their black codes designed to reintroduce most of the trappings of slavery , several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves .	0	government
 Despite acknowledging a common - law individual right to keep and bear arms , in 1876 the Supreme Court declined , in United States v. Cruickshank , to intervene to ensure the states would respect it . United States v. Cruickshank , 92 U.S. 542 ( 1876 ) .	0	government
 6119 . v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .	0	government
 Because the District of Columbia is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments .	0	government
 Two years later , in McDonald v. Chicago , the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision ( 5–4 ) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states , meaning that state regulation of firearms might , in some circumstances , be unconstitutional .	1	government
 In 2015 , however , the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco ’s strict gun control laws to remain in place , suggesting that — as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment — the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute ( [ link]).Richard Gonzales , “ Supreme Court Rejects NRA Challenge to San Francisco Gun Rules , ” National Public Radio , 8 June 2015 . http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412917394/supreme-court-rejects-nra-challenge-to-s-f-gun-rules ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6122 . In either case , the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure ; this warrant is a legal document , signed by a judge , allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property .	0	government
 Since the 1960s , however , the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person can be said to lack a “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” outside the home .	0	government
 6125 . In addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals , the Bill of Rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment .	0	government
 The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising .	0	government
 6128 . The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for violating federal law , even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action .	0	government
 For example , in the early 1990s , several Los Angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist Rodney King during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court , but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating King ’s civil rights .	0	government
 6131 . The final provision of the Fifth Amendment has little to do with crime at all .	0	government
 The takings clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation . ” This provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit .	0	government
 For example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as clothing , housing , education , or food .	0	government
 6134 . Once someone has been charged with a crime and indicted , the next stage in a criminal case is typically the trial itself , unless a plea bargain is reached .	0	government
 The Sixth Amendment contains the provisions that govern criminal trials ; in full , it states :	1	government
 6137 . The Seventh Amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes ; as noted earlier , these are disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused .	1	government
 For example , in an automobile accident , the person responsible is compelled to compensate any others ( either directly or through his or her insurance company ) .	0	government
 6140 . At the same time , however , it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty , perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime .	0	government
 The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed . Elizabeth Lopatto , “ How Many Innocent People Are Sentenced To Death ? , ” Forbes , 29 April 2014 . http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethlopatto/2014/04/29/how-many-innocent-people-are-sentenced-to-death/#6e9ae5175cc1 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 For example , Claude Jones was executed for murder based on 1990-era DNA testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his ; however , with better DNA testing technology , it was later found to be that of the victim . Dave Mann , “ DNA Tests Undermine Evidence in Texas Execution : New Results Show Claude Jones was Put to Death on Flawed Evidence , ” Texas Observer , 11 November 2010 . http://www.texasobserver.org/texas-observer-exclusive-dna-tests-undermine-evidence-in-texas-execution/ ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .	0	government
 As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death . See , for example , “ States With and Without the Death Penalty , ” Death Penalty Information Center , http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .	0	government
 6143 . We saw above that James Madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the Constitution and omitted others .	0	government
 To ensure that those interpreting the Constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the Bill of Rights was not exhaustive , the Ninth Amendment states :	0	government
 6146 . Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights , scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common - law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century : a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life , particularly within the bounds of the home .	1	government
 For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) .	0	government
 6149 . Starting in the 1980s , Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents began to roll back the Roe decision .	0	government
 A key turning point was the court ’s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 , in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe ’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test , which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “ substantial obstacle[s ] ” ( undue burdens ) to women seeking an abortion . Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 ( 1992 ) .	1	government
 Thus , the court upheld some state restrictions , including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion , parental consent ( or , if not possible for some reason such as incest , authorization of a judge ) for minors , and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion .	0	government
 Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden .	0	government
 6152 . In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .	0	government
 Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .	0	government
 Most European countries , at least on paper , have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance , perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes .	0	government
 6155 . Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise , the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed .	0	government
 In these cases , the courts are applying the rational basis test .	0	government
 That is , as long as there ’s a reason for treating some people differently that is “ rationally related to a legitimate government interest , ” the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable . Cornell University Law School : Legal Information Institute .	1	government
 6158 . Discrimination against members of racial , ethnic , or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts , which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases .	0	government
 Under strict scrutiny , the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group — the law or action can be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve the goal in question , and that it is the “ least restrictive means ” available to achieve that goal . Johnson v. California , 543 U.S. 499 ( 2005 ) .	0	government
 In other words , if there is a non - discriminatory way to accomplish the goal in question , discrimination should not take place .	0	government
 6161 . To override the southern states’ actions , lawmakers in Congress proposed two amendments to the Constitution designed to give political equality and power to former slaves ; once passed by Congress and ratified by the necessary number of states , these became the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .	0	government
 The Fourteenth Amendment , in addition to including the equal protection clause as noted above , also was designed to ensure that the states would respect the civil liberties of freed slaves .	0	government
 The Fifteenth Amendment was proposed to ensure the right to vote for black men , which will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter .	0	government
 6164 . In the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson made the radical statement that “ all men are created equal ” and “ are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ” Yet like other wealthy landowners of his time , Jefferson also owned dozens of other human beings as his personal property .	0	government

 6176 . In states where the voting rights of poor whites were less of a concern , another tool for disenfranchisement was the poll tax ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 This was an annual per - person tax , typically one or two dollars ( on the order of $ 20 to $ 50 today ) , that a person had to pay to register to vote .	1	government

 Although de jure segregation , segregation mandated by law , had ended on paper , in practice , few efforts were made to integrate schools in most school districts with substantial black student populations until the late 1960s .	1	government
 Many white southerners who objected to sending their children to school with blacks then established private academies that admitted only white students . Ibid . , 120 , 171 , 173 .	0	government
 6188 . Beyond these favorable court rulings , however , progress toward equality for African Americans remained slow in the 1950s .	0	government
 In 1962 , Congress proposed what later became the Twenty - Fourth Amendment , which banned the poll tax in elections to federal ( but not state or local ) office ; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964 .	1	government
 Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when , in the case of Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections , the Supreme Court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional . Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections , 383 U.S. 663 ( 1966 ) .	1	government
 6191 . Newer , grassroots organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , and Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) challenged the NAACP ’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal - focused strategy .	0	government
 These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .	0	government
 The strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , or the refusal to obey an unjust law , had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma Gandhi to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s .	0	government
 6194 . Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v. Virginia).Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) .	1	government
 While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated .	0	government
 In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E. D. Nixon ’s home was bombed , and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama . See Lynne Olson .	0	government

 The Voting Rights Act proved to have much more immediate and dramatic effect than the laws that preceded it ; what had been a fairly slow process of improving voter registration and participation was replaced by a rapid increase of black voter registration rates — although white registration rates increased over this period as well .

 One of the leaders of the early women ’s movement , Elizabeth Cady Stanton ( [ link ] ) , was shocked and angered when she sought to attend an 1840 antislavery meeting in London , only to learn that women would not be allowed to participate and had to sit apart from the men .	0	government

 6320 . This is sometimes referred to as the bully pulpit approach .	0	government
 The term “ bully pulpit ” was coined by President Theodore Roosevelt , who believed the presidency commanded the attention of the media and could be used to appeal directly to the people .	0	government
 Roosevelt used his position to convince voters to pressure Congress to pass laws .	0	government
 6323 . After taking office in 2009 , President Obama did not order the closing of Guantanamo Bay prison , even though his proposal to do so had garnered support during the 2008 election .	0	government
 President Bush , despite growing public disapproval for the war in Iraq , did not end military support in Iraq after 2006 .	0	government

 The varied registration and voting laws across the United States have long caused controversy .	0	government
 In the aftermath of the Civil War , southern states enacted literacy tests , grandfather clauses , and other requirements intended to disenfranchise black voters in Alabama , Georgia , and Mississippi .	0	government
 Literacy tests were long and detailed exams on local and national politics , history , and more .	1	government
 6332 . States found to violate provisions of the VRA were required to get any changes in their election laws approved by the U.S. attorney general or by going through the court system .	0	government
 However , in Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , the Supreme Court , in a 5–4 decision , threw out the standards and process of the VRA , effectively gutting the landmark legislation . Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 This decision effectively pushed decision - making and discretion for election policy in VRA states to the state and local level .	0	government
 Several such states subsequently made changes to their voter ID laws and North Carolina changed its plans for how many polling places were available in certain areas .	0	government
 6335 . Some attempts have been made to streamline voter registration .	0	government
 The National Voter Registration Act ( 1993 ) , often referred to as Motor Voter , was enacted to expedite the registration process and make it as simple as possible for voters .	0	government
 The act required states to allow citizens to register to vote when they sign up for driver ’s licenses and Social Security benefits .	1	government

 The simple act of moving away to college presents a voter registration problem .	0	government
 Elections are local .	0	government
 6344 . We can count subsections of this population to calculate voter turnout .	0	government
 For instance , the next largest population in the country is the voting - age population ( VAP ) , which consists of persons who are eighteen and older .	1	government
 Some of these persons may not be eligible to vote in their state , but they are included because they are of age to do so . Michael P. McDonald and Samuel Popkin .	0	government
 6347 . Due to consistently low turnout among the young , several organizations have made special efforts to demonstrate to younger citizens that voting is an important activity .	0	government
 Rock the Vote began in 1990 , with the goal of bringing music , art , and pop culture together to encourage the youth to participate in government .	1	government
 The organization hosts rallies , festivals , and concerts that also register voters and promote voter awareness , bringing celebrities and musicians to set examples of civic involvement .	0	government
 6350 . A citizen ’s socioeconomic status — the combination of education , income , and social status — may also predict whether he or she will vote .	1	government
 Among those who have completed college , the 2012 voter turnout rate jumps to 75 percent of eligible voters , compared to about 52.6 percent for those who have completed only high school.“Table 5 .	0	government

 6374 . The general election campaign period occurs between mid - August and early November .	0	government
 These elections are simpler than primaries and conventions , because there are only two major party candidates and a few minor party candidates .	0	government
 6377 . In forty - eight states and the District of Columbia , the candidate who wins the most votes in November receives all the state ’s electoral votes , and only the electors from that party will vote .	1	government
 This is often called the winner - take - all system .	0	government
 In two states , Nebraska and Maine , the electoral votes are divided .	0	government
 6380 . During a presidential election year , members of Congress often experience the coattail effect , which gives members of a popular presidential candidate ’s party an increase in popularity and raises their odds of retaining office .	1	government
 During a midterm election year , however , the president ’s party often is blamed for the president ’s actions or inaction .	0	government
 6383 . There are more candidates vying to become their party ’s nominee , and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one .	0	government
 In the 2016 presidential election , Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options , including Mike Huckabee , Donald Trump , Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , John Kasich , Chris Christie , Carly Fiorina , Ben Carson , and more .	0	government

 6386 . Another source of negative ads is from groups outside the campaigns .	0	government
 Sometimes , shadow campaigns , run by political action committees and other organizations without the coordination or guidance of candidates , also use negative ads to reach voters .	0	government
 Even before the Citizens United decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates , shadow campaigns existed .	0	government
 6389 . Over time , however , ads became more negative and manipulative .	0	government
 In reaction , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , or McCain – Feingold , included a requirement that candidates stand by their ad and include a recorded statement within the ad stating that they approved the message .	0	government
 Although ads , especially those run by super PACs , continue to be negative , candidates can no longer dodge responsibility for them .	0	government

 3617 . Generally , you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D .	0	psychology
 When we do this , we are relying on a number of monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye .	1	psychology
 If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues .	0	psychology
 3620 . The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum . The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) .	1	psychology
 The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .	1	psychology
 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .	0	psychology
 The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea .	1	psychology
 3626 . The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing .	0	psychology
 Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 3629 . Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .	1	psychology
 Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates ( Grothe et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3635 . One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 3638 . Taste ( gustation ) and smell ( olfaction ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe .	0	psychology
 There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses .	0	psychology
 3644 . Many species respond to chemical messages , known as pheromones , sent by another individual ( Wysocki & Preti , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate .	0	psychology
 3650 . Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain .	1	psychology
 This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain ( or congenital analgesia ) .	0	psychology
 While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain .	0	psychology
 3653 . Wertheimer , and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka , who later became his partners , believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli .	1	psychology
 This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology .	0	psychology
 The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts .	0	psychology
 3656 . We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3659 . According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above .	0	psychology
 You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3662 . Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .	0	psychology
 For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 3665 . Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment .	0	psychology
 But unlike instincts and reflexes , learned behaviors involve change and experience : learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience .	1	psychology
 In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience .	0	psychology
 3668 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	0	psychology
 3671 . The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .	1	psychology
 The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .	1	psychology
 Before conditioning , think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this :	0	psychology
 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants’ footsteps .	0	psychology
 The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) .	1	psychology
 In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food .	0	psychology
 3677 . Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) .	1	psychology
 Here ’s how it works .	0	psychology
 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) .	0	psychology
 When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination .	1	psychology
 In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus .	0	psychology
 3683 . John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism .	0	psychology
 Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century , which incorporates elements of Pavlov ’s classical conditioning ( Hunt , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 3686 . Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .	0	psychology
 His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .	1	psychology
 3689 . In negative reinforcement , an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior .	1	psychology
 For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt .	0	psychology
 3692 . In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) .	0	psychology
 In negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior .	1	psychology
 For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy .	0	psychology
 3695 . A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer .	1	psychology
 Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal .	0	psychology
 3698 . Now let ’s combine these four terms .	0	psychology
 A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time .	1	psychology
 For example , June undergoes major surgery in a hospital .	0	psychology
 3701 . In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a reward varies .	1	psychology
 This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule .	0	psychology
 3704 . As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along .	0	psychology
 This is known as latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze .	1	psychology
 Have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game ?	0	psychology
 3707 . Imitation is much more obvious in humans , but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery ?	0	psychology
 Consider Claire ’s experience with observational learning .	0	psychology
 3710 . On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .	1	psychology
 This is called vicarious punishment .	0	psychology
 For example , imagine that four - year - old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in .	0	psychology
 3713 . Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think .	1	psychology
 It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .	0	psychology
 3716 . In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial .	0	psychology
 Natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences .	1	psychology
 For example , if you live in Essex Junction , Vermont , you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow .	0	psychology
 3719 . There are several types of schemata .	0	psychology
 A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave ( Callero , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter .	0	psychology
 3722 . Language , be it spoken , signed , or written , has specific components : a lexicon and grammar .	0	psychology
 Lexicon refers to the words of a given language .	1	psychology
 Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	0	psychology
 3725 . A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .	1	psychology
 Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .	1	psychology
 We use semantics and syntax to construct language .	0	psychology
 3728 . However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 3731 . A problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution .	0	psychology
 Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3734 . A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy .	0	psychology
 While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result , a heuristic is a general problem - solving framework ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) .	1	psychology
 You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems .	0	psychology
 3737 . Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for .	1	psychology
 During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft .	0	psychology
 3740 . For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .	1	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .	1	psychology
 3746 . James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 From a biological perspective , an instinct is a species - specific pattern of behavior that is not learned .	1	psychology
 There was , however , considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct .	0	psychology
 3749 . Researchers Robert Yerkes ( pronounced “ Yerk - EES ” ) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 This relationship is known as Yerkes - Dodson law , which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower .	1	psychology
 3752 . Maslow ’s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives , individual characteristics , or social contexts , Abraham Maslow ( 1943 ) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social .	0	psychology
 These needs are often depicted as a pyramid ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3758 . Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation .	1	psychology
 Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well - developed short story .	0	psychology
 3764 . Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .	1	psychology
 In contrast , convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well - established answer or solution to a problem ( Cropley , 2006 ; Gilford , 1967 )	1	psychology
 3767 . The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( Ahima & Antwi , 2008 ; Woods & D’Alessio , 2008 ) .	0	psychology
 3770 . OBESITYWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered overweight or obese .	0	psychology
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .	1	psychology
 3773 . In cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity , bariatric surgery may be recommended .	0	psychology
 Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight reduction , and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten and/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed ( [ link ] ) ( Mayo Clinic , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 A recent meta - analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non - surgical treatment for obesity in the two - years immediately following the procedure , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( Gloy et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3776 . As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fifth edition , Binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 Unlike with bulimia , eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior , such as purging , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of guilt and embarrassment .	0	psychology
 3779 . Physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers .	0	psychology
 Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality , Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The results of some of these efforts were published in two books — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — which were published in 1948 and 1953 , respectively ( Bullough , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 3782 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 3785 . Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 Orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension .	0	psychology
 In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 3788 . In reality , these are two related , but different , issues .	0	psychology
 Gender identity refers to one ’s sense of being male or female .	1	psychology
 Generally , our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3791 . While you ’re likely familiar with the term “ IQ ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does IQ really mean ?	0	psychology
 IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence .	1	psychology
 You ’ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more aptly , intelligences ) .	0	psychology
 3794 . Interestingly , the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect .	0	psychology
 Named after James Flynn , who was among the first to describe this trend , the Flynn effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last .	1	psychology
 Flynn himself argues , however , that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se ( Flynn , Shaughnessy , & Fulgham , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3797 . Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents .	0	psychology
 Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence .	0	psychology
 The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well - known twin studies .	0	psychology
 3800 . Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly .	1	psychology
 The physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person .	0	psychology
 3803 . Emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional .	0	psychology
 Mood , on the other hand , refers to a prolonged , less intense , affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience .	1	psychology
 Mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion ( Beedie , Terry , Lane , & Devonport , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3806 . Other theorists , however , doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience .	0	psychology
 Thus , the Cannon - Bard theory of emotion was developed .	0	psychology
 According to this view , physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously , yet independently ( Lang , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 3809 . The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate .	0	psychology
 Lazarus ( 1991 ) developed the cognitive - mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus .	1	psychology
 This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious .	0	psychology
 3812 . The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The basolateral complex has dense connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain .	1	psychology
 It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 3815 . Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion .	0	psychology
 A cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable ( Malatesta & Haviland , 1982 ) .	1	psychology
 Therefore , people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion .	0	psychology
 3818 . We also use the tone of our voices , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states .	0	psychology
 Body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language , even if we ’re not consciously aware of it ( de Gelder , 2006 ; Tamietto et al . , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3821 . In the centuries after Galen , other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types , most prominently Immanuel Kant ( in the 18th century ) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( in the 19th century ) ( Eysenck , 2009 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ; Wundt , 1874/1886 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Kant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories ( Eysenck , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3824 . LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESSTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He said that only about one - tenth of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious .	0	psychology
 Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access ( Freud , 1923 ) .	1	psychology
 3827 . It strives for perfection and judges our behavior , leading to feelings of pride or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of guilt .	0	psychology
 In contrast to the instinctual i d and the rule - based superego , the ego is the rational part of our personality .	1	psychology
 It ’s what Freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others .	0	psychology
 3830 . Eventually you forget about it .	0	psychology
 Similarly , in the human psyche , if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with , it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness ( Freud , 1920 ) .	0	psychology
 This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas .	0	psychology
 3833 . For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .	0	psychology
 In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .	1	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 3836 . In the oral stage ( birth to 1 year ) , pleasure is focused on the mouth .	1	psychology
 Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking ( nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs ) play a large part in a baby ’s first year of life .	0	psychology
 3839 . Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period ( 6 years to puberty ) .	1	psychology
 This period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits , such as school , friendships , hobbies , and sports .	0	psychology
 3842 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology
 3845 . Carl Jung ( [ link ] ) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud , who later split off from Freud and developed his own theory , which he called analytical psychology .	0	psychology
 The focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought , and experience within one ’s personality .	1	psychology
 3848 . Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst .	0	psychology
 During the Great Depression , Horney moved from Germany to the United States , and subsequently moved away from Freud ’s teachings .	0	psychology
 3851 . If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today , more than likely you could recall this information quite easily .	0	psychology
 This is known as automatic processing , or the encoding of details like time , space , frequency , and the meaning of words .	1	psychology
 Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness .	0	psychology
 3854 . Visual encoding is the encoding of images , and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds , words in particular .	1	psychology
 To see how visual encoding works , read over this list of words : car , level , dog , truth , book , value .	0	psychology
 3857 . Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .	1	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 3860 . One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short - term memory storage .	0	psychology
 J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s : you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color , which is called the Stroop effect .	1	psychology
 In other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red .	0	psychology
 3863 . Long - term memory ( LTM ) is the continuous storage of information .	1	psychology
 Unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of LTM has no limits .	0	psychology
 3866 . Procedural memory is a type of implicit memory : it stores information about how to do things .	1	psychology
 It is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to brush your teeth , how to drive a car , how to swim the crawl ( freestyle ) stroke .	0	psychology
 3869 . Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced .	1	psychology
 The concept of episodic memory was first proposed about 40 years ago ( Tulving , 1972 ) .	0	psychology
 3872 . How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ?	0	psychology
 The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval .	1	psychology
 This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer ’s hard drive .	0	psychology
 3875 . The third form of retrieval is relearning , and it ’s just what it sounds like .	0	psychology
 It involves learning information that you previously learned .	1	psychology
 3878 . First , let ’s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation .	0	psychology
 The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3881 . There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as epinephrine , dopamine , serotonin , glutamate , and acetylcholine ( Myhrer , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( Blockland , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 Although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories .	0	psychology
 3884 . In other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner , a strict behaviorist , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the enduring , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists .	0	psychology
 3887 . In contrast to Skinner ’s idea that the environment alone determines behavior , Bandura ( 1990 ) proposed the concept of reciprocal determinism , in which cognitive processes , behavior , and context all interact , each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned , including beliefs , expectations , and personality characteristics .	1	psychology
 3890 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .	0	psychology
 Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .	1	psychology
 In Rotter ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external locus of control ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3893 . Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma , such as a blow to the head .	0	psychology
 With anterograde amnesia , you can not remember new information , although you can remember information and events that happened prior to your injury .	1	psychology
 The hippocampus is usually affected ( McLeod , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3896 . Because memory is so fragile , witnesses can be easily ( and often accidentally ) misled due to the problem of suggestibility .	0	psychology
 Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories .	1	psychology
 In the fall of 2002 , a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gas station , leaving Home Depot , and walking down the street .	0	psychology
 3899 . She has studied false memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse .	0	psychology
 Loftus also developed the misinformation effect paradigm , which holds that after exposure to incorrect information , a person may misremember the original event .	1	psychology
 3902 . Let ’s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors : transience , which means that memories can fade over time .	1	psychology
 Here ’s an example of how this happens .	0	psychology
 3905 . Now let ’s take a look at the three errors of distortion : misattribution , suggestibility , and bias .	0	psychology
 Misattribution happens when you confuse the source of your information .	1	psychology
 Let ’s say Alejandro was dating Lucia and they saw the first Hobbit movie together .	0	psychology
 3908 . When the new year starts , do you find you accidentally write the previous year ?	0	psychology
 These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .	1	psychology
 Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .	1	psychology
 3911 . This perspective focuses on how healthy people develop .	0	psychology
 One pioneering humanist , Abraham Maslow , studied people who he considered to be healthy , creative , and productive , including Albert Einstein , Eleanor Roosevelt , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , and others .	0	psychology
 Maslow ( 1950 , 1970 ) found that such people share similar characteristics , such as being open , creative , loving , spontaneous , compassionate , concerned for others , and accepting of themselves .	0	psychology
 4314 . Rather , we do not have to .	0	economic
 The reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor , a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith , [ link ] , in his book , The Wealth of Nations .	0	economic
 Adam SmithAdam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks .	0	economic
 4317 . First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .	0	economic
 ( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )	0	economic
 People have different skills , talents , and interests , so they will be better at some jobs than at others .	0	economic
 4323 . John Maynard Keynes ( 1883–1946 ) , one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century , pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking .	0	economic
 Keynes , shown in [ link ] , famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist ’s book : “ [ Economics ] is a method rather than a doctrine , an apparatus of the mind , a technique of thinking , which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions . ” In other words , economics teaches you how to think , not what to think .	0	economic
 4332 . In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .	0	economic
 Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .	1	economic
 Businesses supply goods and services based on demand .	0	economic
 4335 . It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013 , according to an entity known as The World Bank .	0	economic
 Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .	1	economic
 Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 4338 . Burgers cost $ 2 each , and bus tickets are 50 cents each .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows Alphonso ’s budget constraint , that is , the outer boundary of his opportunity set .	1	economic
 The opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget .	1	economic
 4344 . These decisions do not look back to past choices .	0	economic
 Thus , the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs , which are costs that were incurred in the past and can not be recovered , should not affect the current decision .	1	economic
 4350 . Productive efficiency means that , given the available inputs and technology , it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good .	1	economic
 All choices on the PPF in [ link ] , including A , B , C , D , and F , display productive efficiency .	0	economic
 4353 . When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country , we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good .	1	economic
 In our example , Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat .	0	economic
 4356 . The first theme is scarcity .	0	economic
 It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods .	0	economic
 4362 . Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied .	0	economic
 Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 4365 . The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	1	economic
 4368 . Then , those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand : Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Therefore , the elasticity of demand from G to H 1.47 .	0	economic
 The magnitude of the elasticity has increased ( in absolute value ) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B .	0	economic
 Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .	0	economic
 4371 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .	1	economic
 In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 While perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic , goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves .	0	economic
 4374 . However , in some cases , the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise .	0	economic
 For example , many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil .	0	economic
 Coffee shops use coffee as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price of coffee .	0	economic
 4377 . However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .	0	economic
 When the income elasticity of demand is negative , the good is called an inferior good . The concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in Demand and Supply .	1	economic
 A higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good , which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive .	1	economic
 4380 . In markets for financial capital , the elasticity of savings — that is , the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates — will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital .	1	economic
 That is :	0	economic
 4383 . Private enterprise , the ownership of businesses by private individuals , is a hallmark of the U.S. economy .	1	economic
 When people think of businesses , often giants like Wal - Mart , Microsoft , or General Motors come to mind .	0	economic
 4386 . These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit , accounting profit and economic profit .	0	economic
 Accounting profit is a cash concept .	0	economic
 It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .	1	economic
 4389 . However , the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns .	0	economic
 When a firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run , a useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories : fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed . Fixed and Variable Costs	0	economic
 4392 . At some point , you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other ’s way .	0	economic
 In this case , the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease , as shown in the last row of [ link].This pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production .	0	economic
 As another example , consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer ’s field .	0	economic
 4395 . Marginal cost is somewhat different .	0	economic
 Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output .	1	economic
 So it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced , but only the next one ( or next few ) .	0	economic
 4401 . This pattern was illustrated earlier in [ link].In the middle portion of the long - run average cost curve , the flat portion of the curve around Q3 , economies of scale have been exhausted .	0	economic
 In this situation , allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production , and it is called constant returns to scale .	0	economic
 In this range of the LRAC curve , the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls .	0	economic
 4407 . When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up , for example , people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands , commuting by carpool or mass transit , or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home .	0	economic
 Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand .	1	economic
 The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .	0	economic
 4410 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .	1	economic
 Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 4413 . When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .	0	economic
 Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied — that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied — the law of supply .	1	economic
 The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .	0	economic
 4416 . Remember this : When two lines on a diagram cross , this intersection usually means something .	0	economic
 The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .	1	economic
 The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) .	1	economic
 4419 . In fact , at any above - equilibrium price , the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 We call this an excess supply or a surplus .	0	economic
 4422 . A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables : quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis .	0	economic
 The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .	0	economic
 4425 . They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home , and so on .	0	economic
 A product whose demand falls when income rises , and vice versa , is called an inferior good .	1	economic
 In other words , when income increases , the demand curve shifts to the left .	0	economic
 4428 . Other goods are complements for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other .	1	economic
 Examples include breakfast cereal and milk ; notebooks and pens or pencils , golf balls and golf clubs ; gasoline and sport utility vehicles ; and the five - way combination of bacon , lettuce , tomato , mayonnaise , and bread .	0	economic
 4431 . In thinking about the factors that affect supply , remember what motivates firms : profits , which are the difference between revenues and costs .	1	economic
 Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor , materials , and machinery , or what we call inputs or factors of production .	1	economic
 If a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged , a firm ’s profits go up .	0	economic
 4434 . How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events ?	0	economic
 The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption .	0	economic
 Look at how each economic event affects each market , one event at a time , holding all else constant .	1	economic
 4437 . Price controls come in two flavors .	0	economic
 A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level ( the “ ceiling ” ) , while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level ( the “ floor ” ) .	1	economic
 This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings .	0	economic
 4440 . If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington are higher than in other cities , more nurses will move to Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington to find jobs , more people will be willing to train as nurses , and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full - time job .	0	economic
 In other words , there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area . At equilibrium , the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal .	1	economic
 Thus , every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker , and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job .	0	economic
 4443 . The labor market , however , presents some prominent examples of price floors , which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low - paid workers .	0	economic
 The U.S. government sets a minimum wage , a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate .	1	economic
 In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 4449 . Many states do have usury laws , which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge .	1	economic

 4455 . José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility , which is the term economists use to describe a person ’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices . Let ’s begin with an assumption , which will be discussed in more detail later , that José can measure his own utility with something called utils .	1	economic
 ( It is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals ; if one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils , this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much . )	0	economic
 4458 . Another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar .	0	economic
 Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility José receives given the price of the product .	1	economic
 For José ’s T - shirts and movies , the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4461 . Let ’s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly ’s choice between concert tickets at $ 50 each and getting away overnight to a bed - and - breakfast for $ 200 per night .	0	economic
 Kimberly has $ 1,000 per year to spend between these two choices .	0	economic
 4464 . A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .	0	economic
 Goods where demand declines as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ inferior goods . ” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises , because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer .	1	economic
 For example , a higher - income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car , and instead eat more steak and buy a new car .	0	economic
 4470 . Rates of saving in America have never been especially high , but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years , as the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in [ link ] show .	0	economic
 A decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint .	0	economic
 Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor - leisure decision .	0	economic
 4473 . This insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return .	0	economic
 For example , Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) and 401(k ) accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later , after retirement .	1	economic
 The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual , while a 401(k ) needs to be set up through an employer .	0	economic
 4476 . Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting , or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values .	1	economic
 Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible , or having equal value to the individual , regardless of the situation .	0	economic
 You might , for instance , think of the $ 25 you found in the street differently from the $ 25 you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant .	0	economic
 4479 . A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker , because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market .	1	economic
 If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny , it will lose all of its sales to competitors .	0	economic
 4482 . [ link ] presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [ link ] .	0	economic
 The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit .	1	economic
 As mentioned before , a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product — that is , the firm ’s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level .	0	economic
 4485 . But in the long run , firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output , and some firms will cease production altogether .	0	economic
 The long - run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit .	1	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from , and the reasons why some firms go out of business . Why do firms cease to exist ?	0	economic
 4488 . For a constant cost industry , whenever there is an increase in market demand and price , then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms’ entry and stops at the point where the new long - run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before .	1	economic
 But why will costs remain the same ?	0	economic
 4491 . When profit - maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility - maximizing consumers , something remarkable happens : the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency ( terms that were first introduced in ( Choice in a World of Scarcity ) .	0	economic
 Productive efficiency means producing without waste , so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 In the long run in a perfectly competitive market , because of the process of entry and exit , the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .	0	economic
 4494 . These profits should attract vigorous competition as described in Perfect Competition , and yet , because of one particular characteristic of monopoly , they do not .	0	economic
 Barriers to entry are the legal , technological , or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market .	1	economic
 Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable , such as the cost of renting retail space , to the extremely restrictive .	0	economic

 4503 . AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission , so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism .	0	economic
 The same thing happened to local service , especially in recent years , with the growth in cellular phone systems . The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation , starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s .	0	economic
 This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter , the prices that could be charged , and the quantities that could be produced in many industries , including telecommunications , airlines , trucking , banking , and electricity .	0	economic
 4506 . But a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs , because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience .	0	economic
 A monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit - maximizing combination of quantity and price .	1	economic
 4509 . Allocative efficiency is a social concept .	0	economic
 It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output , the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost .	1	economic
 4512 . One type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition .	0	economic
 Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms , but the products that they sell are not identical .	1	economic
 4515 . A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways : physical aspects of the product , location from which the product is sold , intangible aspects of the product , and perceptions of the product .	1	economic
 Products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products .	0	economic
 4518 . As an example of a profit - maximizing monopolistic competitor , consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store , which serves pizza with cheese , sweet and sour sauce , and your choice of vegetables and meats .	0	economic
 Although Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants , it has a differentiated product .	0	economic
 4521 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .	0	economic
 The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .	1	economic
 When price is equal to average cost , economic profits are zero .	0	economic
 4524 . Critics of market - oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles .	0	economic
 They argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation , and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation , is socially wasteful — that is , most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price .	0	economic
 Defenders of a market - oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names , no one is forcing them to do so .	0	economic
 4527 . Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve — which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms ( and they need not produce differentiated products ) .	0	economic
 Again , smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete , while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price .	0	economic
 4530 . In the United States , as well as many other countries , it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti - competitive behavior , which is a violation of antitrust law .	0	economic

 Certain international organizations , like the nations that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly , hold down output , and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports .	0	economic
 Such agreements , however , because they fall in a gray area of international law , are not legally enforceable .	0	economic
 4539 . Thus , if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel , but do not match price increases , then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices , since the potential gains are minimal .	0	economic
 This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation , in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output , increase price , and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement .	0	economic
 4542 . The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers , and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones , are called antitrust laws .	1	economic
 Before a large merger happens , the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger , prohibit it , or allow it if certain conditions are met .	0	economic
 4545 . Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .	1	economic
 In 1950 , the Celler - Kefauver Act extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers .	0	economic
 In the twenty - first century , the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws .	0	economic
 4548 . Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index ( HHI ) .	0	economic
 The HHI , as it is often called , is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry , as the following Work it Out shows .	1	economic
 4551 . For more on the difficulties of defining markets , refer to Monopoly . This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies , instead of defining a market and counting up total sales .	0	economic
 A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real - world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger .	0	economic
 A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry .	0	economic

Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm ( or firms ) reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low , until the new firm is driven out of the market , at which point the existing firm raises prices again .	0	economic
 This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market .	0	economic

 The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .	1	economic
 Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	0	economic
 4572 . If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	0	economic
 If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .	0	economic
 4575 . Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .	0	economic
 If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .	0	economic

 4596 . Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want .	0	economic
 As Gregory Lee , CEO of Samsung said , “ Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology . ” An innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above - normal profits before competitors can catch up .	0	economic
 4599 . If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .	0	economic
 However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .	0	economic
 The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 4602 . The social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug .	1	economic
 If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies , its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial , and it would be willing to borrow and invest $ 52 million .	0	economic
 However , if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits , the firm will not spend as much on creating new products .	0	economic
 4605 . After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .	0	economic
 While not always easy to measure , according to Walter McMahon , the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population , lower levels of crime , a cleaner environment and a more stable , democratic government .	1	economic
 For these reasons , many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary , secondary , and higher education .	0	economic

 The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for two reasons , it costs jobs in other unprotected industries .	0	economic
 First , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries .	0	economic
 5230 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .	0	economic
 After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .	0	economic
 Meanwhile , low - skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing .	0	economic

 5248 . What is a function ?	0	economic
 A function describes a relationship .	1	economic
 Sometimes the relationship is a definition .	0	economic
 5251 . The concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between two variables .	1	economic
 A positive slope means that two variables are positively related ; that is , when x increases , so does y , or when x decreases , y decreases also .	1	economic
 Graphically , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises .	0	economic

 5260 . This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .	1	economic
 By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic — the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model . What Is an Indifference Curve ?	0	economic
 5263 . From this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high — so on the margin , it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book .	0	economic
 In short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution — that is , the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods .	1	economic
 5266 . Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations : a substitution effect and an income effect .	0	economic
 The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out substitutes .	1	economic
 If oranges become more expensive , fruit - lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples , grapefruit , or raisins .	0	economic
 5269 . The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen , so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility .	0	economic
 The slope of the budget constraint in a labor - leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate .	0	economic
 Thus , the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set , reflecting the labor - leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate , but tangent to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ” The shift from original choice A to point C , which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line , shows that because of the higher wage , Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income .	0	economic
 5272 . The expenditure - output model , sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram , determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced .	1	economic
 The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending .	0	economic
 5275 . When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium , it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP — because by definition , GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy .	1	economic
 Thus , the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the 45-degree line .	0	economic
 5278 . The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures .	1	economic
 The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .	1	economic

 5284 . The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function ( after taxes ) , the investment function , the government spending function , the export function , and the import function .	1	economic
 The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and export expenditures — which do not vary with national income .	0	economic
 5287 . Conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( AE0 ) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP .	0	economic
 The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap .	1	economic
 The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting .	0	economic
 5290 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .	0	economic
 One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .	1	economic
 Conversely , if a situation is inefficient , it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others . Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved .	1	economic
 5293 . Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $ 45 , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ 80 , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product .	0	economic

 1819 . Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system .	0	biology
 The cells in the tubules are called flame cells ( or protonephridia ) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope , as illustrated in [ link]a .	1	biology
 The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface ; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid , allowing for filtration .	0	biology
 1825 . Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water .	0	biology
 Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic .	1	biology
 Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes .	0	biology

 Urea concentration in the blood , called blood urea nitrogen or BUN , is used as an indicator of kidney function .	1	biology
 1831 . The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts .	1	biology
 A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen .	1	biology
 1834 . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected .	0	biology
 When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’s surface .	0	biology
 PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells .	1	biology
 1840 . The first cytokines to be produced are pro - inflammatory ; that is , they encourage inflammation , the localized redness , swelling , heat , and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection . The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen .	1	biology
 1843 . Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi .	0	biology
 A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens .	1	biology
 A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1846 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .	1	biology
 T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .	0	biology
 1849 . MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens ( “ non - self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes .	0	biology
 MHC II molecules interact with helper T - cells to trigger the appropriate immune response , which may include the inflammatory response . Lymphocytes , such as NK cells , are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope .	1	biology

 1852 . An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins , called a complement system , functions to destroy extracellular pathogens .	1	biology
 Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously ; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms .	0	biology
 1855 . In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized .	0	biology
 There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell - mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies .	0	biology
 Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen .	0	biology
 1858 . Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells .	0	biology
 Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines .	1	biology
 Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen - presenting cell .	0	biology
 1861 . Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .	0	biology
 In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .	0	biology
 The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) .	0	biology
 1864 . Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells : they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts , and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells .	1	biology
 1867 . Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .	0	biology
 Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors .	1	biology
 The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .	0	biology
 1870 . The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) .	1	biology
 Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes .	1	biology
 Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems , which are separated by interstitial space , by a process called extravasation ( passing through to surrounding tissue ) .	0	biology
 1873 . Not all antibodies bind with the same strength , specificity , and stability .	0	biology
 In fact , antibodies exhibit different affinities ( attraction ) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably , and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen .	0	biology
 1876 . Once the afferent arterioles are constricted , blood flow into the nephrons stops .	0	biology
 These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system .	0	biology
 1879 . Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .	1	biology
 Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels .	0	biology

 It is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea .	0	biology
 1885 . The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody - mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy .	1	biology
 In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens .	0	biology
 1888 . Both methods have advantages and disadvantages .	0	biology
 Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent .	1	biology

 Invertebrates such as earthworms , slugs , tapeworms and snails , shown in [ link ] , are often hermaphroditic .	0	biology
 1897 . In ovoviparity , fertilized eggs are retained in the female , but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg ’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched .	1	biology
 This occurs in some bony fish ( like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus ) , some sharks , some lizards , some snakes ( such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis ) , some vipers , and some invertebrate animals ( like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa ) .	0	biology

 The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis .	1	biology
 1918 . At the onset of puberty , the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time .	0	biology
 FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood .	0	biology
 1924 . The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs , while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining .	1	biology
 These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle , with an average length of 28 days .	0	biology
 1927 . To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes , only one sperm must fuse with one egg .	0	biology
 In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 1930 . Cleavage can take place in two ways : holoblastic ( total ) cleavage or meroblastic ( partial ) cleavage .	0	biology
 The type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs .	0	biology
 1936 . During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester , nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion .	0	biology
 As the trimester progresses , the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium , and the placenta forms .	0	biology
 This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus , with the mother ’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it .	1	biology
 1939 . Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise , during further development , to the different organs in the animal body .	1	biology

 One core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment .	0	biology
 1945 . Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal , population , and community ecology .	0	biology
 The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components ( living things ) in an area along with the abiotic components ( non - living things ) of that area .	1	biology
 Some of the abiotic components include air , water , and soil .	0	biology
 1954 . Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage .	0	biology

 Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy .	0	biology
 1957 . All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .	1	biology
 The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 1960 . The intertidal zone , which is the zone between high and low tide , is the oceanic region that is closest to land ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Generally , most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach .	0	biology
 1963 . Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .	1	biology
 Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents .	0	biology
 1966 . Watch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) video to see marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms . It is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs .	0	biology
 These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral .	1	biology
 In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores .	0	biology
 1969 . Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water , crop irrigation , sanitation , and industry .	1	biology
 These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services .	0	biology
 Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are , therefore , connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes .	0	biology
 1972 . The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .	0	biology
 The channel ( the width of the river or stream ) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream .	1	biology
 Because of this , the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream .	0	biology
 1975 . Climate refers to the long - term , predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area .	1	biology
 The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges .	0	biology

 There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature .	0	biology
 1987 . For mobile organisms , such as mammals , birds , or fish , a technique called mark and recapture is often used .	0	biology
 This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way ( such as tags , bands , paint , or other body markings ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( recaptures ) and some individuals that are unmarked ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1990 . Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time ( usually with data compiled from a life table ) .	1	biology
 These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1993 . After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .	0	biology
 When the population size , N , is plotted over time , a J - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link]).The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited .	0	biology
 Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 1996 . Obviously , a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human .	0	biology
 The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential , or rmax , thus changing the equation to :	0	biology
 2005 . While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration , other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten , even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals .	0	biology
 In Batesian mimicry , a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one .	1	biology
 Assuming they share the same predators , this coloration then protects the harmless ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic .	0	biology
 2008 . All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem , which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community .	1	biology
 The competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat .	1	biology
 In other words , different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources .	0	biology
 2011 . A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism , where two species benefit from their interaction .	1	biology
 Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis .	0	biology
 2020 . Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time .	1	biology
 In primary succession , newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things ; in secondary succession , part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain .	1	biology
 2023 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 2026 . One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning .	1	biology
 Innate behavior , or instinct , is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned .	0	biology
 2029 . A similar , but more directed version of kinesis is taxis : the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus .	1	biology
 This movement can be in response to light ( phototaxis ) , chemical signals ( chemotaxis ) , or gravity ( geotaxis ) and can be directed toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus .	0	biology
 2032 . Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources .	1	biology
 Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors , and these are favored by natural section .	1	biology
 2038 . Significant energy is spent in the process of locating , attracting , and mating with the sex partner .	0	biology
 Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics : intersexual selection , the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex , and intrasexual selection , the competition for mates between species members of the same sex .	1	biology
 Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual , aural , tactile , and chemical cues .	0	biology
 2041 . In polyandrous mating systems , one female mates with many males .	1	biology
 These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems .	0	biology
 2044 . Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning , where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence .	1	biology
 During operant conditioning , the behavioral response is modified by its consequences , with regards to its form , strength , or frequency .	1	biology
 2047 . Some primates , including humans , are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions .	0	biology
 The development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning , the manipulation of information using the mind , the most prominent method of human learning .	1	biology
 In fact , that is how students are learning right now by reading this book .	0	biology
 2050 . Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population .	1	biology
 In other words , fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring .	0	biology
 2053 . Additionally , populations do not usually exist in isolation .	0	biology
 They engage in interspecific competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources .	1	biology
 These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow .	0	biology
 2056 . In contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r designation ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments .	0	biology
 2062 . The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage .	0	biology
 In ecology , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 2068 . Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .	1	biology
 In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in [ link ] , the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain .	0	biology
 2071 . A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .	1	biology
 A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .	1	biology
 These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms .	0	biology
 2077 . An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 Ideally , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers ( such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health .	0	biology
 2086 . One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification .	0	biology
 Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent , toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level , from the primary producers to the apex consumers .	1	biology
 Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate , including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , which was published in the 1960s bestseller , Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson .	0	biology
 2095 . As rain falls through this gas , it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain .	0	biology
 Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas , turning it into weak sulfuric acid , which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems .	1	biology
 Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes , which kills many of the resident fauna ; it also affects the man - made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings .	0	biology
 2098 . The Nile perch was introduced in 1963 , but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge .	0	biology
 The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the disappearance of a species ) .	0	biology
 In fact , there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria : the Nile perch , declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria , and increased fishing pressure .	0	biology
 2101 . It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems .	0	biology
 2104 . In 1988 , British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss : biodiversity hotspots .	0	biology
 Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species .	1	biology
 The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation triage .	0	biology
 2107 . A second approach to estimating present - time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest - area loss and understanding species - area relationships .	0	biology
 The species - area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased .	1	biology
 Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases .	0	biology

 Hunting is practiced throughout the world , but hunting practices , particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia , are believed to threaten several species with extinction .	0	biology
 4615 . Goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called common resources .	1	economic
 Because the waters of the Caribbean are open to all conch fishermen , and because any conch that you catch is conch that I can not catch , common resources like the conch tend to be overharvested .	0	economic
 4621 . The current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line , although the dollar amounts are adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time .	0	economic
 The U.S. poverty line in 2015 ranged from $ 11,790 for a single individual to $ 25,240 for a household of four people .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows the U.S. poverty rate over time ; that is , the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any given year .	0	economic
 The poverty rate declined through the 1960s , rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s , but seems to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s .	0	economic

 4627 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor . Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .	1	economic
 4633 . SNAP participation increased by 70 % between 2007 and 2011 , from 26.6 million participants to 45 million .	0	economic
 According to the Congressional Budget Office , this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the Great Recession of 2008–2009 and rising food prices . The federal government deploys a range of income security programs that are funded through departments such as Health and Human Services , Agriculture , and Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) ( see [ link ] ) .	0	economic
 According to the Office of Management and Budget , collectively , these three departments provided an estimated $ 62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children , subsidized housing , and energy assistance .	0	economic
 4636 . Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .	0	economic
 We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States . Measuring Income Distribution by QuintilesOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .	1	economic
 4642 . The programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor .	1	economic
 Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .	0	economic
 4645 . The United States does have an estate tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance .	1	economic
 However , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $ 5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth .	0	economic
 4648 . What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ?	0	economic
 To analyze these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor .	0	economic
 If no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( E ) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor ( D ) and the supply of labor ( S ) in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4651 . In the past , presidential use of the Taft - Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but , in this case , it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement . In other instances , unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies .	0	economic
 In one prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor - saving machinery in the mines .	0	economic
 The mineworkers’ union realized that over time , the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines , but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity .	0	economic
 4654 . Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion .	1	economic
 There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which arises if workers with the same skill levels — as measured by education , experience , and expertise — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender .	0	economic
 4657 . If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers .	0	economic
 In a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , hiring , and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors .	0	economic
 4663 . Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns .	0	economic
 Those who express concern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like [ link ] which shows total inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century .	0	economic

 As such , many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information , where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information ( one party knows much more than the other ) .	1	economic
 4669 . For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality .	0	economic
 If there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions .	0	economic
 4672 . When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products , then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity .	0	economic
 Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity .	0	economic
 4675 . In the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back guarantee , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality .	1	economic
 This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail - order catalogs or over the web , whose customers can not see the actual products , because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it .	0	economic
 4678 . Sellers of labor provide information through resumes , recommendations , school transcripts , and examples of their work .	0	economic
 Occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market .	0	economic
 Occupational licenses , which are typically issued by government agencies , show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test .	1	economic
 4681 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4687 . Pension insurance : Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised .	1	economic
 4690 . Retirement insurance : All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly .	1	economic
 Social Security and Medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits .	0	economic
 4693 . Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs .	0	economic
 For example , insurance policies often have deductibles , which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying .	1	economic
 For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 4696 . A final way of reducing moral hazard , which is especially applicable to health care , is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care , rather than consumers .	0	economic
 Traditionally , most health care in the United States has been provided on a fee - for - service basis , which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services .	1	economic
 However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .	0	economic

 4705 . Firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future .	0	economic
 Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years , or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years , or starts a research and development project .	0	economic
 Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by reinvesting profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( 4 ) by selling stock .	0	economic
 4711 . In this way , an individual investor could , in effect , loan the firm $ 5,000 , or any multiple of that amount .	0	economic
 Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder .	1	economic
 If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .	0	economic
 4714 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .	0	economic
 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	0	economic
 4717 . That rate of return can come in two forms .	0	economic
 A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders , called a dividend .	1	economic

 4726 . A high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years .	0	economic
 The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time .	1	economic
 4729 . A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades , as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month .	0	economic
 4732 . Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds .	1	economic
 A number of today ’s well - known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft .	0	economic
 4735 . ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )	0	economic
 The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	0	economic
 4738 . [ link ] shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds : 10-year Treasury bonds ( which are officially called “ notes ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody ’s , an independent firm that publishes such ratings .	0	economic
 Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together .	0	economic
 4741 . Purchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the Internet age , but it remains something of a task .	0	economic
 To simplify the process , companies offer mutual funds , which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies .	1	economic
 The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs .	0	economic
 4744 . The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing .	0	economic
 Thus , in attempting to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication .	0	economic
 4750 . For example , many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made — they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it .	0	economic
 In September 2009 , President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff ( taxes added on imported goods ) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year , 30 percent in its second year , and 25 percent in its third year .	1	economic
 Interestingly , the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step , because most of them also import tires from China and other countries .	0	economic
 4753 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic
 They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording .	0	economic
 4759 . Politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district , where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way .	0	economic
 Thus , when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly ask each other to include pork - barrel spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district .	1	economic
 Pork - barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs : the benefits of pork - barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country .	0	economic

 [ link ] breaks down what is produced into five categories : durable goods , nondurable goods , services , structures , and the change in inventories .	0	economic
 Before going into detail about these categories , notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand .	0	economic
 4783 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .	1	economic
 The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .	1	economic
 The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people .	1	economic
 4786 . The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .	1	economic
 The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .	1	economic
 Generally , it is the real value that is more important .	0	economic

 However , over time , the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP ( that is , the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line ) , because the rise in nominal GDP is exaggerated by the presence of inflation , especially in the 1970s . U.S .	0	economic

 4798 . So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries , or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ?	0	economic
 This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population .	1	economic
 4801 . GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society .	0	economic
 GDP per capita is only an average .	0	economic
 When GDP per capita rises by 5 % , it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5 % , or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less — or even declined .	0	economic
 4804 . According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .	0	economic
 The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .	1	economic
 Ingenious machines — the steam engine , the power loom , and the steam locomotive — performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do .	0	economic

 4816 . It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say , Benin , simply because of the great difference in population size .	0	economic
 To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita .	0	economic
 Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like Belgium , Uruguay , or Zimbabwe , with countries that have larger populations , like the United States , the Russian Federation , or Nigeria .	0	economic

 The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government - supported special economic zones ( SEZ ) .	0	economic
 These are areas of the country , usually with access to a port where , among other benefits , the government does not tax trade .	1	economic
 4822 . A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns .	0	economic
 Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita , the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish .	1	economic
 For example , raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth - grade level to a high school diploma ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output .	0	economic
 4825 . An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory .	0	economic
 The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers .	0	economic
 4828 . They are , however , also counted in the employed group .	0	economic
 All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term “ hidden unemployment . ” Discouraged workers , those who have stopped looking for employment and , hence , are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group	1	economic
 4831 . The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy .	0	economic
 During periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high .	0	economic
 During periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower .	0	economic
 4834 . The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( i.e .	1	economic
 the business cycle ) is known as cyclical unemployment .	0	economic
 4837 . One set of reasons why wages may be “ sticky downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions .	0	economic
 For low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages .	0	economic
 For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike .	0	economic
 4840 . Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate .	1	economic
 One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary .	0	economic
 4843 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others .	0	economic
 4846 . But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job .	0	economic
 The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment .	1	economic
 Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing .	0	economic
 4849 . Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy .	1	economic
 Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices .	0	economic
 4852 . To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy .	0	economic
 The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time .	0	economic
 4855 . Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices .	0	economic
 The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 .	0	economic
 4858 . A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption .	0	economic
 Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen .	1	economic
 4861 . The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods .	0	economic
 For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services .	1	economic
 It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 4864 . An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	0	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 Unlike the CPI , its baskets are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s GDP would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices .	0	economic
 4867 . Inflation in China averaged about 10 % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has dropped off since then .	0	economic
 Russia experienced hyperinflation — an outburst of high inflation — of 2,500 % per year in the early 1990s , although by 2006 Russia ’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10 % per year , as shown in [ link ] .	1	economic
 The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War , 1860–1865 , in the Confederate states . Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates , 1980–2013These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in Brazil , China , and Russia .	0	economic
 4870 . Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation .	0	economic
 If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 4873 . Moreover , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful , prolonged conflicts between employers and employees .	0	economic
 If the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently , minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link].U.S .	0	economic
 Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation , the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010 , even though the nominal figure climbed from $ 1.40 to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 4876 . Prices are the messengers in a market economy , conveying information about conditions of demand and supply .	0	economic
 Inflation blurs those price messages .	0	economic
 4879 . Second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible .	0	economic
 The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result .	0	economic
 4882 . In the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost - of - living adjustments ( COLAs ) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation .	1	economic
 These contracts were sometimes written as , for example , COLA plus 3 % .	0	economic
 4885 . Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	0	economic
 This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base . As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing , in 1996 the U.S. , government began offering indexed bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds are means by which the U.S. government ( and many private - sector companies as well ) borrows money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government repays the money with interest .	1	economic
 4888 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic
 If exports and imports are equal , then trade is balanced .	0	economic
 4891 . Old habits are hard to break .	0	economic
 Economists , however , typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid .	0	economic
 4894 . The second row of [ link ] provides data on trade in services .	0	economic
 Here , the U.S. economy is running a surplus .	0	economic
 Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .	0	economic
 4897 . Some of the other countries listed include Brazil , the largest economy in Latin America ; Nigeria , the largest economy in Africa ; and China , India , and Korea .	0	economic
 The first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP .	0	economic
 The second column shows the trade balance .	0	economic
 4900 . The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments .	0	economic
 Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy .	0	economic
 4903 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ?	0	economic
 4906 . For most years of the nineteenth century , U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit .	0	economic
 Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900 .	0	economic
 4909 . The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade .	0	economic
 The United States has a low level of trade , but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 4912 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic
 4224 . Schizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought , perception , emotion , and behavior .	1	psychology
 About 1 % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood ( early to mid-20s ) .	0	psychology
 4230 . Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes — usually detected by what a person says .	1	psychology
 The person might ramble , exhibit loose associations ( jump from topic to topic ) , or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words .	0	psychology
 4233 . Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors , emotions , or drives ( Green , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions , speech , or movements , even when such expressions are normal or expected .	1	psychology
 4236 . Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use .	0	psychology
 Although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( Thornicroft , 1990 ) , such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice versa .	0	psychology
 4239 . These experiences can include such events as combat , threatened or actual physical attack , sexual assault , natural disasters , terrorist attacks , and automobile accidents .	0	psychology
 This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in which a cause ( extreme trauma ) is explicitly specified . Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event , flashbacks ( states that can last from a few seconds to several days , during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment [ APA , 2013 ] ) , avoidance of stimuli connected to the event , persistently negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , guilt , and shame ) , feelings of detachment from others , irritability , proneness toward outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response ( jumpiness ) .	1	psychology
 For PTSD to be diagnosed , these symptoms must occur for at least one month .	0	psychology
 4248 . Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .	1	psychology
 Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .	1	psychology
 4251 . suicidal ideation : thoughts of death ( not just fear of dying ) , thinking about or planning suicide , or making an actual suicide attempt .	1	psychology
 4254 . People with persistent depressive disorder ( previously known as dysthymia ) experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years , as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder .	1	psychology
 People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy , but do not meet all the criteria for major depression .	0	psychology
 4257 . During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .	1	psychology
 The person may talk loudly and rapidly , exhibiting flight of ideas , abruptly switching from one topic to another .	0	psychology
 These individuals are easily distracted , which can make a conversation very difficult .	0	psychology
 4260 . Another cognitive theory of depression , hopelessness theory , postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness , which then leads to depression ( Abramson , Metalsky , & Alloy , 1989 ) .	1	psychology
 According to this theory , hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes .	1	psychology
 4263 . One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry .	0	psychology
 Contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior ( Pompili et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 Low levels of serotonin predict future suicide attempts and suicide completions , and low levels have been observed post - mortem among suicide victims ( Mann , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 4269 . Although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD , considerable evidence suggests that hoarding represents an entirely different disorder ( Mataix - Cols et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 People with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions , regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are .	1	psychology
 As a result , these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their living areas ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4272 . This woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and duration than would a 21-year - old college junior who is having trouble finding a date for the annual social .	0	psychology
 Some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , persistent , and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one ’s life , this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder . Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Although anxiety is universally experienced , anxiety disorders cause considerable distress .	0	psychology
 4275 . Rachman ( 1977 ) proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways .	0	psychology
 The first pathway is through classical conditioning .	0	psychology
 As you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response ( UCR ) , eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 4278 . When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes .	1	psychology
 Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact , rehearsing sentences before speaking , talking only briefly , and not talking about oneself ( Alden & Bieling , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 4281 . The exact genes and gene functions involved in this disorder , however , are not well - understood ( APA , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 Neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder .	1	psychology
 Located in the brainstem , the locus coeruleus is the brain ’s major source of norepinephrine , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response .	1	psychology
 4284 . For example , an individual may worry about her health and finances , the health of family members , the safety of her children , or minor matters ( e.g. , being late for an appointment ) without having any legitimate reason for doing so ( APA , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 A diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder — what Sigmund Freud referred to as free - floating anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least six months , and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms : restlessness , difficulty concentrating , being easily fatigued , muscle tension , irritability , and sleep difficulties .	1	psychology
 4287 . Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component ; in fact , there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors .	0	psychology
 The graph in [ link ] shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 4290 . A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .	1	psychology
 Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .	1	psychology
 The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 4293 . No universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present ( Zachar & Kendler , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 However , one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield ( 1992 ) , who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction .	0	psychology
 Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms — that is , psychological processes honed by evolution , such as cognition , perception , and learning — have important functions , such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought , problem solving , and communication .	1	psychology
 4296 . THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS ( DSM)Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time , the one that is used by most mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , published by the American Psychiatric Association ( 2013 ) .	0	psychology

 Do you tend to be sociable or shy ?	0	psychology
 4302 . As you have learned in this chapter , personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors .	0	psychology
 The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .	1	psychology
 4305 . One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) , first published in 1943 , with 504 true / false questions , and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989 , with 567 questions .	0	psychology
 The original MMPI was based on a small , limited sample , composed mostly of Minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients ; the revised inventory was based on a more representative , national sample to allow for better standardization .	0	psychology
 4308 . A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test ( TAT ) , created in the 1930s by Henry Murray , an American psychologist , and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan .	0	psychology
 A person taking the TAT is shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture .	1	psychology
 910 . GnetophytesGnetophytes are the closest relative to modern angiosperms , and include three dissimilar genera of plants : Ephedra , Gnetum , and Welwitschia ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Like angiosperms , they have broad leaves .	0	biology
 913 . Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .	0	biology
 Sepals and petals together form the perianth .	1	biology
 The sexual organs ( carpels and stamens ) are located at the center of the flower .	1	biology
 919 . Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .	1	biology
 925 . Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support , especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic .	0	biology
 Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory , or consumption of plants by insects and other animals .	0	biology
 This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination .	0	biology
 931 . In seed plants , the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation , and at the same time , a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte : from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte .	0	biology
 Whereas lower vascular plants , such as club mosses and ferns , are mostly homosporous ( produce only one type of spore ) , all seed plants , or spermatophytes , are heterosporous .	1	biology
 They form two types of spores : megaspores ( female ) and microspores ( male ) .	1	biology
 940 . The process of animal development begins with the cleavage , or series of mitotic cell divisions , of the zygote ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .	0	biology
 949 . More complex animals ( those with bilateral symmetry ) develop three tissue layers : an inner layer ( endoderm ) , an outer layer ( ectoderm ) , and a middle layer ( mesoderm ) .	1	biology
 Animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts .	1	biology
 955 . Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .	0	biology
 These two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first : mouth or anus .	0	biology
 964 . The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes ( including chordates and echinoderms ) and two distinct clades of protostomes ( including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans ) ( [ link]ab ) .	0	biology
 Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	0	biology
 967 . While the validity of this claim is still under investigation , these primitive fossils appear to be small , one - centimeter long , sponge - like creatures .	0	biology
 These fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years , actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 Until this discovery , most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 973 . Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .	0	biology
 Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum .	1	biology
 However , sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms , including variations in the size of the spongocoel , the number of osculi , and where the cells that filter food from the water are located .	0	biology
 976 . The gel - like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges .	0	biology
 In addition to the osculum , sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge .	1	biology
 In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 979 . In some sponges , sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl , which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica , depending on the type of sponge .	0	biology
 These spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge .	0	biology
 982 . Cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes ( “ stinging cells ” ) containing organelles called nematocysts ( stingers ) .	0	biology
 These cells are present around the mouth and tentacles , and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells .	1	biology
 985 . The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .	1	biology
 Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .	0	biology
 In terms of cellular complexity , cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer , such as nerve cells , contractile epithelial cells , enzyme - secreting cells , and nutrient - absorbing cells , as well as the presence of intercellular connections .	0	biology
 988 . The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes .	0	biology
 The slit - like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore .	1	biology
 The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food , and may extend for up to two - thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity .	1	biology
 991 . The rotifers are a microscopic ( about 100 µm to 30 mm ) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona , a rotating , wheel - like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Although their taxonomy is currently in flux , one treatment places the rotifers in three classes : Bdelloidea , Monogononta , and Seisonidea .	0	biology
 994 . A unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel .	0	biology
 The proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species .	1	biology
 997 . Phylum Mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments .	0	biology
 It is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks ; there are over 75,000 described species , making them the second most diverse phylum of animals .	0	biology
 1000 . Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally , although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks , such as snails and slugs , or in cephalopods .	0	biology
 In some mollusks , the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages — trochophore and veliger — before becoming a young adult ; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage , glochidia .	0	biology
 1003 . These animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Shells may be planospiral ( like a garden hose wound up ) , commonly seen in garden snails , or conispiral , ( like a spiral staircase ) , commonly seen in marine conches .	0	biology
 1006 . The phylum includes earthworms , polychaete worms , and leeches .	0	biology
 Annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called “ segmented worms ” due to their key characteristic of metamerism , or true segmentation .	1	biology
 1009 . The number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in Oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes ( poly = many , chaetae = hairs ) .	0	biology
 The many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy , flat , paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia , which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates .	1	biology
 The subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as Hirudo medicinalis and Hemiclepsis marginata .	0	biology
 1012 . Tagma may be in the form of a head , thorax , and abdomen , or a cephalothorax and abdomen , or a head and trunk .	0	biology
 A central cavity , called the hemocoel ( or blood cavity ) , is present , and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single - chambered heart .	0	biology
 Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod : insects and myriapods use a series of tubes ( tracheae ) that branch through the body , open to the outside through openings called spiracles , and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae , whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills , terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs , and aquatic chelicerates use book gills ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1015 . Most crustaceans are dioecious , which means that the sexes are separate .	1	biology
 Some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites .	0	biology
 Serial hermaphroditism , where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova , may also be seen in some species .	1	biology
 1018 . A “ head ” tagmum is not usually discernible .	0	biology
 The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages : the chelicerae ( [ link ] ) , which are specialized , claw - like or fang - like mouthparts .	1	biology
 These animals do not possess antennae .	0	biology
 1021 . There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes , including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo .	0	biology
 In deuterostomes , internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom .	1	biology
 The endodermal lining of the archenteron ( or the primitive gut ) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer .	0	biology
 1024 . These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum .	0	biology
 These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system .	0	biology
 An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate , even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost .	0	biology
 1027 . Characteristics of ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In some groups , some of these are present only during embryonic development .	0	biology
 1030 . Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx ( the region just posterior to the mouth ) that extend to the outside environment .	1	biology
 In organisms that live in aquatic environments , pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding .	0	biology
 1033 . Members of Urochordata are also known as tunicates ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The name tunicate derives from the cellulose - like carbohydrate material , called the tunic , which covers the outer body of tunicates .	0	biology
 1036 . A cranium is a bony , cartilaginous , or fibrous structure surrounding the brain , jaw , and facial bones ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head ; of these , those that have a cranium compose the clade Craniata .	0	biology
 1039 . Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .	0	biology
 Vertebrata is named for the vertebral column , composed of vertebrae , a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In adult vertebrates , the vertebral column replaces the notochord , which is only seen in the embryonic stage .	0	biology
 1042 . The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .	0	biology
 Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world , except for the polar regions .	0	biology
 1045 . Gnathostomes or “ jaw - mouths ” are vertebrates that possess jaws .	1	biology
 One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw , which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food .	1	biology
 1048 . Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .	0	biology
 Sharks , together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians , also have a sense organ called the lateral line , which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water , and is often considered homologous to “ hearing ” in terrestrial vertebrates .	1	biology
 The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish ’s body .	0	biology
 1051 . Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .	1	biology
 Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .	1	biology
 1054 . Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water , to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land ; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period .	0	biology
 One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega .	0	biology
 Acanthostega was aquatic ; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes .	0	biology
 1057 . Frogs are amphibians that belong to the order Anura ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates , with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica .	0	biology
 1060 . Extra - embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo .	1	biology
 While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself , the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac .	1	biology
 The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg ’s external environment .	0	biology
 1063 . The initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids .	0	biology
 Synapsids include all mammals , including extinct mammalian species .	0	biology
 Synapsids also include therapsids , which were mammal - like reptiles from which mammals evolved .	0	biology
 1066 . Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .	1	biology
 Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .	1	biology
 Anapsids include extinct organisms and may , based on anatomy , include turtles .	0	biology
 1069 . In cold weather , some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate .	0	biology
 Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating , but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves .	1	biology
 Rather , their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures , and the animal is very sluggish .	0	biology
 1072 . Crocodilia ( “ small lizard ” ) arose with a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic ; extant species include alligators , crocodiles , and caimans .	0	biology
 Crocodilians ( [ link ] ) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa , South America , Southern Florida , Asia , and Australia .	0	biology
 1075 . Turtles are members of the clade Testudines ( “ having a shell ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell .	0	biology
 1078 . Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .	0	biology
 Eccrine glands produce sweat , or perspiration , which is mainly composed of water .	1	biology
 In most mammals , eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body , and some mammals do not possess them at all .	0	biology
 1081 . The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features .	0	biology
 The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone , the dentary .	0	biology
 The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone .	0	biology
 1084 . There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .	0	biology
 The leathery - beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1087 . Some examples are Insectivora , the insect eaters ; Edentata , the toothless anteaters ; Rodentia , the rodents ; Cetacea , the aquatic mammals including whales ; Carnivora , carnivorous mammals including dogs , cats , and bears ; and Primates , which includes humans .	0	biology
 Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother , allowing for gas , fluid , and nutrient exchange .	1	biology
 While other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta , all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation .	0	biology
 1090 . Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .	0	biology
 Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust .	1	biology
 Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 1093 . The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates , which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings .	0	biology
 Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles ( collarbones ) , forming the furcula or wishbone .	1	biology
 The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping .	0	biology
 1096 . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .	0	biology
 This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds .	0	biology
 1099 . Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs , tarsiers , monkeys , apes , and humans .	0	biology
 Non - human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America , Africa , and Asia .	0	biology
 1102 . Order Primates is divided into two groups : prosimians and anthropoids .	0	biology
 Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa , the lemurs of Madagascar , and the lorises , pottos , and tarsiers of Southeast Asia .	0	biology
 Anthropoids include monkeys , apes , and humans .	0	biology
 1105 . By 40 million years ago , evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World ( South America ) and the Old World ( Africa and Asia ) .	1	biology
 New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini — a reference to their broad noses ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini — a reference to their narrow noses .	0	biology
 1108 . The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae , including gibbons and siamangs .	0	biology
 The great apes include the genera Pan ( chimpanzees and bonobos ) ( [ link]a ) , Gorilla ( gorillas ) , Pongo ( orangutans ) , and Homo ( humans ) ( [ link]b ) .	1	biology
 The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes ; they have low sexual dimorphism ( that is , the sexes are not markedly different in size ) ; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees . The ( a ) chimpanzee is one of the great apes .	1	biology
 1111 . Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago .	1	biology
 This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) .	0	biology
 1114 . Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems : a shoot system , and a root system .	0	biology
 The shoot system consists of two portions : the vegetative ( non - reproductive ) parts of the plant , such as the leaves and the stems , and the reproductive parts of the plant , which include flowers and fruits .	1	biology
 The shoot system generally grows above ground , where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis .	0	biology
 1117 . Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .	1	biology
 Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1120 . Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .	1	biology
 Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 1123 . Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .	1	biology
 Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .	1	biology
 1126 . Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .	1	biology
 The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .	1	biology
 The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 1129 . Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 They are found in the stem , the root , the inside of the leaf , and the pulp of the fruit .	0	biology
 1132 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 1135 . Two cells , known as guard cells , surround each leaf stoma , controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	0	biology
 1138 . Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .	1	biology
 Vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls ; they are shorter than tracheids .	1	biology
 Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element .	0	biology
 1141 . Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells , but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem .	0	biology
 The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith , while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex .	1	biology
 1144 . The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm , which grows inward from the cambium .	0	biology
 The cork cambium , cork cells , and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm .	1	biology
 The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 1147 . Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .	0	biology
 Corms are similar to rhizomes , except they are more rounded and fleshy ( such as in gladiolus ) .	0	biology
 Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	0	biology
 1150 . Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp . ) .	1	biology
 Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	0	biology
 1153 . Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .	1	biology
 Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .	1	biology
 1156 . A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil .	0	biology
 In contrast , a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface , and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion ( lawn grasses are a good example , as are wheat , rice , and corn ) .	1	biology
 Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots .	0	biology
 1159 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 1162 . This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .	0	biology
 The outermost cell layer of the root ’s vascular tissue is the pericycle , an area that can give rise to lateral roots .	1	biology
 In dicot roots , the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape , whereas in monocot roots , the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith .	1	biology
 1165 . Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 1168 . The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy .	1	biology
 The number and placement of a plant ’s leaves will vary depending on the species , with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement .	0	biology
 1171 . In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .	1	biology
 In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .	1	biology
 Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology
 1174 . The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick ; however , in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions , the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration .	0	biology
 A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species .	1	biology
 The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface .	0	biology
 1177 . Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface .	1	biology
 It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem .	0	biology
 1180 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	1	biology
 1183 . Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low - molecular - weight sugars using only carbon dioxide , light , and water .	0	biology
 Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light .	1	biology
 It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space .	0	biology
 1186 . The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants ; it can be crucial for competition and survival .	0	biology
 The response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors , which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light - absorbing pigment called a chromophore .	1	biology
 Together , the two are called a chromoprotein .	0	biology
 1189 . Most activation occurs on the lit side , causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid ( IAA ) to accumulate on the shaded side .	0	biology
 Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.Cryptochromes are another class of blue - light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin - based chromophore .	1	biology
 Cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle , also know as its circadian rhythem , using blue light cues .	1	biology
" 1192 . The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein , which means "" to grow . """	0	biology
 Auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism .	1	biology
 They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue , and promote leaf development and arrangement .	0	biology
 1195 . Gibberellins ( GAs ) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation , seed germination , and fruit and flower maturation .	1	biology
 GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems , young leaves , and seed embryos .	0	biology
 1198 . Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory .	0	biology
 Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator , resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites .	0	biology
 1201 . The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism , from the Greek words thigma meaning “ touch , ” and tropism implying “ direction . ” Tendrils are one example of this .	1	biology
 The meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive ; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response .	0	biology
 1204 . Plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds .	0	biology
 An organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon , such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants .	0	biology
 1207 . The essential elements can be divided into two groups : macronutrients and micronutrients .	0	biology
 Nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients .	1	biology
 About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients : carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium and sulfur .	0	biology
 2116 . During the Middle Ages , most Europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord , a church , and simple homes for the peasants or serfs , who made up about 60 percent of western Europe ’s population .	0	history
 Hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over Europe ( [ link]).One of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is Carcassonne , France .	0	history
 2119 . During this period , the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe . Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons , village and family life revolved around the Church .	0	history
 The sacraments , or special ceremonies of the Church , marked every stage of life , from birth to maturation , marriage , and burial , and brought people into the church on a regular basis .	1	history
 As Christianity spread throughout Europe , it replaced pagan and animistic views , explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms .	0	history
 2122 . By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .	1	history
 This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .	1	history
 2131 . The Inca had no system of writing , however .	0	history
 They communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the quipu ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 2140 . Everywhere in the Americas , a crushing demand for labor bedeviled Europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going .	0	history
 Spain granted encomiendas — legal rights to native labor — to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown .	1	history
 This system reflected the Spanish view of colonization : the king rewarded successful conquistadors who expanded the empire .	0	history
 2143 . The economic philosophy of mercantilism shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s .	0	history
 Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth , as measured in gold and silver bullion , existed in the world .	1	history
 2146 . As Europeans traversed the Atlantic , they brought with them plants , animals , and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean .	1	history
 These two - way exchanges between the Americas and Europe / Africa are known collectively as the Columbian Exchange ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2149 . In the 1500s , Spain surpassed Portugal as the dominant European power .	0	history
 This age of exploration and the subsequent creation of an Atlantic World marked the earliest phase of globalization , in which previously isolated groups — Africans , Native Americans , and Europeans — first came into contact with each other , sometimes with disastrous results .	1	history
 2152 . Spain , with its New World wealth , was the bastion of the Catholic faith .	0	history
 Beginning with the reform efforts of Martin Luther in 1517 and John Calvin in the 1530s , however , Catholic dominance came under attack as the Protestant Reformation , a split or schism among European Christians , began .	1	history
 2155 . However , by the late 1500s , some English members of the Church began to agitate for more reform .	1	history
 Known as Puritans , they worked to erase all vestiges of Catholicism from the Church of England .	0	history
 At the time , the term “ puritan ” was a pejorative one ; many people saw Puritans as holier - than - thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors .	0	history
 2158 . By choosing to settle along the rivers on the banks of the Chesapeake , the English unknowingly placed themselves at the center of the Powhatan Empire , a powerful Algonquian confederacy of thirty native groups with perhaps as many as twenty - two thousand people .	1	history
 The territory of the equally impressive Susquehannock people also bordered English settlements at the north end of the Chesapeake Bay .	0	history
 2164 . The abundance of European goods gave rise to new artistic objects .	0	history
 For example , iron awls made the creation of shell beads among the native people of the Eastern Woodlands much easier , and the result was an astonishing increase in the production of wampum , shell beads used in ceremonies and as jewelry and currency .	1	history
 Native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed , and this practice escalated with the arrival of European goods .	0	history
 2167 . The Dutch West India Company found the business of colonization in New Netherland to be expensive .	0	history
 To share some of the costs , it granted Dutch merchants who invested heavily in it patroonships , or large tracts of land and the right to govern the tenants there .	1	history
 In return , the shareholder who gained the patroonship promised to pay for the passage of at least thirty Dutch farmers to populate the colony .	0	history
 2173 . The Glorious Revolution also led to the English Toleration Act of 1689 , a law passed by Parliament that allowed for greater religious diversity in the Empire .	1	history
 This act granted religious tolerance to nonconformist Trinitarian Protestants ( those who believed in the Holy Trinity of God the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost ) , such as Baptists ( those who advocated adult baptism ) and Congregationalists ( those who followed the Puritans’ lead in creating independent churches ) .	1	history
 While the Church of England remained the official state religious establishment , the Toleration Act gave much greater religious freedom to nonconformists .	0	history
 2176 . The Freemasons were a fraternal society that advocated Enlightenment principles of inquiry and tolerance .	1	history
 Freemasonry originated in London coffeehouses in the early eighteenth century , and Masonic lodges ( local units ) soon spread throughout Europe and the British colonies .	0	history
 2179 . The monarchy was dissolved , and England became a republic : a state without a king .	1	history
 Oliver Cromwell headed the new English Commonwealth , and the period known as the English interregnum , or the time between kings , began .	1	history
 2182 . Creating wealth for the Empire remained a primary goal , and in the second half of the seventeenth century , especially during the Restoration , England attempted to gain better control of trade with the American colonies .	1	history
 The mercantilist policies by which it tried to achieve this control are known as the Navigation Acts .	0	history
 2185 . The Bostonians Paying the Excise - man , or Tarring and Feathering ( [ link ] ) , shows five Patriots tarring and feathering the Commissioner of Customs , John Malcolm , a sea captain , army officer , and staunch Loyalist .	1	history
 The print shows the Boston Tea Party , a protest against the Tea Act of 1773 , and the Liberty Tree , an elm tree near Boston Common that became a rallying point against the Stamp Act of 1765 .	1	history
 2188 . Prior to the 1764 act , colonial violations of the Navigation Acts had been tried in local courts , where sympathetic colonial juries refused to convict merchants on trial .	0	history
 However , the Sugar Act required violators to be tried in vice - admiralty courts .	0	history
 These crown - sanctioned tribunals , which settled disputes that occurred at sea , operated without juries .	1	history
 2194 . In 1765 , the British Parliament moved beyond the efforts during the previous two years to better regulate westward expansion and trade by putting in place the Stamp Act .	0	history
 As a direct tax on the colonists , the Stamp Act imposed an internal tax on almost every type of printed paper colonists used , including newspapers , legal documents , and playing cards .	1	history
 While the architects of the Stamp Act saw the measure as a way to defray the costs of the British Empire , it nonetheless gave rise to the first major colonial protest against British imperial control as expressed in the famous slogan “ no taxation without representation . ” The Stamp Act reinforced the sense among some colonists that Parliament was not treating them as equals of their peers across the Atlantic .	0	history
 2200 . However , Pitt was old and ill with gout .	0	history
 His chancellor of the exchequer , Charles Townshend ( [ link ] ) , whose job was to manage the Empire ’s finances , took on many of his duties .	0	history
 Primary among these was raising the needed revenue from the colonies .	0	history
 2203 . Great Britain pursued a policy of law and order when dealing with the crises in the colonies in the late 1760s and 1770s .	0	history
 Relations between the British and many American Patriots worsened over the decade , culminating in an unruly mob destroying a fortune in tea by dumping it into Boston Harbor in December 1773 as a protest against British tax laws .	0	history
 The harsh British response to this act in 1774 , which included sending British troops to Boston and closing Boston Harbor , caused tensions and resentments to escalate further .	0	history
 2206 . By the time the British withdrew from Boston , fighting had broken out in other colonies as well .	0	history
 In May 1775 , Mecklenburg County in North Carolina issued the Mecklenburg Resolves , stating that a rebellion against Great Britain had begun , that colonists did not owe any further allegiance to Great Britain , and that governing authority had now passed to the Continental Congress .	1	history
 The resolves also called upon the formation of militias to be under the control of the Continental Congress .	0	history
 2209 . He argued for the creation of an American republic , a state without a king , and extolled the blessings of republicanism , a political philosophy that held that elected representatives , not a hereditary monarch , should govern states .	1	history
 The vision of an American republic put forward by Paine included the idea of popular sovereignty : citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them , and decide other issues , on the basis of majority rule .	1	history
 Republicanism also served as a social philosophy guiding the conduct of the Patriots in their struggle against the British Empire .	0	history
 2212 . The southern colonies soon became the center of the fighting .	0	history
 The southern strategy brought the British success at first , but thanks to the leadership of George Washington and General Nathanael Greene and the crucial assistance of French forces , the Continental Army defeated the British at Yorktown , effectively ending further large - scale operations during the war .	0	history
 2215 . Whereas the British could pay in gold and silver , the American forces relied on paper money , backed by loans obtained in Europe .	1	history
 This first American money was called Continental currency ; unfortunately , it quickly fell in value .	0	history
 “ Not worth a Continental ” soon became a shorthand term for something of no value .	0	history
 2218 . To many revolutionaries , especially wealthy landowners , merchants , and planters , democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy .	0	history
 Indeed , conservative Whigs defined themselves in opposition to democracy , which they equated with anarchy .	0	history
 In the tenth in a series of essays later known as The Federalist Papers , Virginian James Madison wrote : “ Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . ” Many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic tendencies in check .	0	history
 2221 . While racial thinking permeated the new country , and slavery existed in all the new states , the ideals of the Revolution generated a movement toward the abolition of slavery .	0	history
 Private manumissions , by which slaveholders freed their slaves , provided one pathway from bondage .	1	history
 Slaveholders in Virginia freed some ten thousand slaves .	0	history
 2224 . Pennsylvania ’s constitution also eliminated the executive branch ( there was no governor ) and the upper house .	0	history
 Instead , Pennsylvania had a one - house — a unicameral — legislature .	1	history
 2227 . James Madison put forward a proposition known as the Virginia Plan , which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 The plan featured a bicameral or two - house legislature , with an upper and a lower house .	1	history
 The people of the states would elect the members of the lower house , whose numbers would be determined by the population of the state .	0	history
 2230 . Roger Sherman from Connecticut offered a compromise to break the deadlock over the thorny question of representation .	0	history
 His Connecticut Compromise , also known as the Great Compromise , outlined a different bicameral legislature in which the upper house , the Senate , would have equal representation for all states ; each state would be represented by two senators chosen by the state legislatures .	1	history
 Only the lower house , the House of Representatives , would have proportional representation .	0	history
 2233 . In the fierce debate that erupted , the two sides articulated contrasting visions of the American republic and of democracy .	0	history
 Supporters of the 1787 Constitution , known as Federalists , made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future .	1	history
 Those who opposed it , known as Anti - Federalists , argued that the Constitution would consolidate all power in a national government , robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions .	1	history
 2236 . For the national government to be effective , Hamilton deemed it essential to have the support of those to whom it owed money : the wealthy , domestic creditor class as well as foreign creditors .	0	history
 In January 1790 , he delivered his “ Report on Public Credit “ ( [ link ] ) , addressing the pressing need of the new republic to become creditworthy .	1	history
 He recommended that the new federal government honor all its debts , including all paper money issued by the Confederation and the states during the war , at face value .	0	history
 2239 . The events of 1793 and 1794 challenged the simple interpretation of the French Revolution as a happy chapter in the unfolding triumph of republican government over monarchy .	0	history
 The French king was executed in January 1793 ( [ link ] ) , and the next two years became known as the Terror , a period of extreme violence against perceived enemies of the revolutionary government .	1	history
 Revolutionaries advocated direct representative democracy , dismantled Catholicism , replaced that religion with a new philosophy known as the Cult of the Supreme Being , renamed the months of the year , and relentlessly employed the guillotine against their enemies .	0	history
 2245 . One of Adams ’s appointees , William Marbury , had been selected to be a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia , and when his commission did not arrive , he petitioned the Supreme Court for an explanation from Jefferson ’s secretary of state , James Madison .	0	history
 In deciding the case , Marbury v. Madison , in 1803 , Chief Justice John Marshall agreed that Marbury had the right to a legal remedy , establishing that individuals had rights even the president of the United States could not abridge .	0	history
 However , Marshall also found that Congress ’s Judicial Act of 1789 , which would have given the Supreme Court the power to grant Marbury remedy , was unconstitutional because the Constitution did not allow for cases like Marbury ’s to come directly before the Supreme Court .	0	history
 2248 . New Orleans and the vast Mississippi River Valley had been successfully defended , ensuring the future of American settlement and commerce .	0	history
 The Battle of New Orleans immediately catapulted Jackson to national prominence as a war hero , and in the 1820s , he emerged as the head of the new Democratic Party .	0	history
 2251 . Workers were organized the way that they had been in English factories , in family units .	0	history
 Under the “ Rhode Island system , ” families were hired .	1	history
 The father was placed in charge of the family unit , and he directed the labor of his wife and children .	0	history
 2254 . In Philadelphia , New York , and Boston — all cities that experienced dizzying industrial growth during the nineteenth century — workers united to form political parties .	0	history
 Thomas Skidmore , from Connecticut , was the outspoken organizer of the Working Men ’s Party , which lodged a radical protest against the exploitation of workers that accompanied industrialization .	1	history
 Skidmore took his cue from Thomas Paine and the American Revolution to challenge the growing inequity in the United States .	0	history
 2260 . Even short waterways , such as the two - and - a - half - mile canal going around the rapids of the Ohio River near Louisville , Kentucky , proved a huge leap forward , in this case by opening a water route from Pittsburgh to New Orleans .	0	history
 The preeminent example was the Erie Canal ( [ link ] ) , which linked the Hudson River , and thus New York City and the Atlantic seaboard , to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Valley .	1	history
 2263 . Before the 1820s , a code of deference had underwritten the republic ’s political order .	0	history
 Deference was the practice of showing respect for individuals who had distinguished themselves through military accomplishments , educational attainment , business success , or family pedigree .	1	history
 2266 . In this way , Van Buren helped create a political machine of disciplined party members who prized loyalty above all else , a harbinger of future patronage politics in the United States .	1	history
 This system of rewarding party loyalists is known as the spoils system ( from the expression , “ To the victor belong the spoils ” ) .	0	history
 Van Buren ’s political machine helped radically transform New York politics .	0	history
 2269 . The tariff raised questions about how power should be distributed , causing a fiery debate between those who supported states’ rights and those who supported the expanded power of the federal government ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Those who championed states’ rights denounced the 1828 measure as the Tariff of Abominations , clear evidence that the federal government favored one region , in this case the North , over another , the South .	0	history
 They made their case by pointing out that the North had an expanding manufacturing base while the South did not .	0	history
 2272 . Calhoun fell out of favor with President Jackson , who defended Peggy Eaton and derided those who would not socialize with her , declaring she was “ as chaste as a virgin . ” ( Jackson had personal reasons for defending Eaton : he drew a parallel between Eaton ’s treatment and that of his late wife , Rachel , who had been subjected to attacks on her reputation related to her first marriage , which had ended in divorce . )	0	history
 Martin Van Buren , who defended the Eatons and organized social gatherings with them , became close to Jackson , who came to rely on a group of informal advisers that included Van Buren and was dubbed the Kitchen Cabinet .	0	history
 This select group of presidential supporters highlights the importance of party loyalty to Jackson and the Democratic Party .	0	history
 2275 . Jackson ’s veto of the bank and his Specie Circular helped galvanize opposition forces into a new political party , the Whigs , a faction that began to form in 1834 .	0	history
 The name was significant ; opponents of Jackson saw him as exercising tyrannical power , so they chose the name Whig after the eighteenth - century political party that resisted the monarchical power of King George III .	0	history
 2278 . In a series of forced marches , some fifteen thousand Cherokee were finally relocated to Oklahoma .	1	history
 This forced migration , known as the Trail of Tears , caused the deaths of as many as four thousand Cherokee ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 The Creek , Choctaw , Chickasaw , and Seminole peoples were also compelled to go .	0	history
 2281 . The campaign thrust Harrison into the national spotlight .	0	history
 Democrats tried to discredit him by declaring , “ Give him a barrel of hard [ alcoholic ] cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him , and take my word for it , he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin . ” The Whigs turned the slur to their advantage by presenting Harrison as a man of the people who had been born in a log cabin ( in fact , he came from a privileged background in Virginia ) , and the contest became known as the log cabin campaign ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 At Whig political rallies , the faithful were treated to whiskey made by the E. C. Booz Company , leading to the introduction of the word “ booze ” into the American lexicon .	0	history
 2284 . The Adams - Onís Treaty upset many American expansionists , who criticized Adams for not laying claim to all of Texas , which they believed had been included in the Louisiana Purchase .	0	history
 In the summer of 1819 , James Long , a planter from Natchez , Mississippi , became a filibuster , or a private , unauthorized military adventurer , when he led three hundred men on an expedition across the Sabine River to take control of Texas .	1	history
 Long ’s men succeeded in capturing Nacogdoches , writing a Declaration of Independence ( see below ) , and setting up a republican government .	0	history
 2287 . After the 1819 Adams - Onís Treaty defined the U.S .- Mexico boundary , the Spanish Mexican government began actively encouraging Americans to settle their northern province .	1	history
 Texas was sparsely settled , and the few Mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile Indian tribes , especially the Comanche , who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle . To increase the non - Indian population in Texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of Mexico , Spain began to recruit empresarios .	0	history
 An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land .	1	history
 2290 . Like Spain , Mexico also wished to encourage settlement in the state of Coahuila y Texas and passed colonization laws to encourage immigration .	0	history
 Thousands of Americans , primarily from slave states , flocked to Texas and quickly came to outnumber the Tejanos , the Mexican residents of the region .	1	history
 The soil and climate offered good opportunities to expand slavery and the cotton kingdom .	0	history
 2293 . Indeed , Mexico refused even to acknowledge Polk ’s emissary , John Slidell , who had been sent to Mexico City to negotiate .	0	history
 Not to be deterred , Polk encouraged Thomas O. Larkin , the U.S. consul in Monterey , to assist any American settlers and any Californios , the Mexican residents of the state , who wished to proclaim their independence from Mexico .	0	history
 By the end of 1845 , having broken diplomatic ties with the United States over Texas and having grown alarmed by American actions in California , the Mexican government warily anticipated the next move .	0	history
 2296 . Once in California , gathered in camps with names like Drunkard ’s Bar , Angel ’s Camp , Gouge Eye , and Whiskeytown , the “ forty - niners ” did not find wealth so easy to come by as they had first imagined .	0	history
 Although some were able to find gold by panning for it or shoveling soil from river bottoms into sieve - like contraptions called rockers , most did not .	1	history
 2299 . Would they pledge to support it ?	0	history
 At the party ’s New York State convention in Buffalo , Martin Van Buren ’s antislavery supporters — called Barnburners because they were likened to farmers who were willing to burn down their own barn to get rid of a rat infestation — spoke in favor of the proviso .	1	history
 Their opponents , known as Hunkers , refused to support it .	0	history
 2302 . The Compromise of 1850 brought temporary relief .	0	history
 It resolved the issue of slavery in the territories for the moment and prevented secession .	0	history
 2305 . Almost no cotton was grown in the United States in 1787 , the year the federal constitution was written .	0	history
 However , following the War of 1812 , a huge increase in production resulted in the so - called cotton boom , and by midcentury , cotton became the key cash crop ( a crop grown to sell rather than for the farmer ’s sole use ) of the southern economy and the most important American commodity .	1	history
 By 1850 , of the 3.2 million slaves in the country ’s fifteen slave states , 1.8 million were producing cotton ; by 1860 , slave labor was producing over two billion pounds of cotton per year .	0	history
 2308 . White men invested substantial sums in slaves , carefully calculating the annual returns they could expect from a slave as well as the possibility of greater profits through natural increase .	0	history
 The domestic slave trade was highly visible , and like the infamous Middle Passage that brought captive Africans to the Americas , it constituted an equally disruptive and horrifying journey now called the second middle passage .	0	history
 Between 1820 and 1860 , white American traders sold a million or more slaves in the domestic slave market .	0	history
 2311 . In 1854 , American diplomats met in Ostend , Belgium , to find a way to gain Cuba .	0	history
 They wrote a secret memo , known as the Ostend Manifesto ( thought to be penned by James Buchanan , who was elected president two years later ) , stating that if Spain refused to sell Cuba to the United States , the United States was justified in taking the island as a national security measure .	1	history
 2314 . The thousands swept up in the movement believed in the possibility of creating a much better world .	0	history
 Many adopted millennialism , the fervent belief that the Kingdom of God would be established on earth and that God would reign on earth for a thousand years , characterized by harmony and Christian morality .	1	history
 Those drawn to the message of the Second Great Awakening yearned for stability , decency , and goodness in the new and turbulent American republic .	0	history
 2317 . German Protestant migrants formed several pietistic societies : communities that stressed transformative individual religious experience or piety over religious rituals and formality .	1	history
 One of the earliest of these , the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania , was founded by a charismatic leader named Conrad Beissel in the 1730s .	0	history
 2320 . During the late 1820s , Smith translated the writing on the golden plates , and in 1830 , he published his finding as The Book of Mormon .	0	history
 That same year , he organized the Church of Christ , the progenitor of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints popularly known as Mormons .	1	history
 He presented himself as a prophet and aimed to recapture what he viewed as the purity of the primitive Christian church , purity that had been lost over the centuries . Smith emphasized the importance of families being led by fathers .	0	history
 2323 . However , temperance enjoyed a revival in the 1840s , as a new type of reformer took up the cause against alcohol .	0	history
 The engine driving the new burst of enthusiastic temperance reform was the Washington Temperance Society ( named in deference to George Washington ) , which organized in 1840 .	0	history
 The leaders of the Washingtonians came not from the ranks of Protestant ministers but from the working class .	0	history
 2326 . An early and popular “ reform ” to slavery was colonization , or a movement advocating the displacement of African Americans out of the country , usually to Africa .	1	history
 In 1816 , the Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America ( also called the American Colonization Society or ACS ) was founded with this goal .	0	history
 2329 . Garrison also preached immediatism : the moral demand to take immediate action to end slavery .	1	history
 He wrote of equal rights and demanded that blacks be treated as equal to whites .	0	history
 2332 . The operation of the law further alarmed northerners and confirmed for many the existence of a “ Slave Power”—that is , a minority of elite slaveholders who wielded a disproportionate amount of power over the federal government , shaping domestic and foreign policies to suit their interests .	1	history
 Despite southerners’ repeated insistence on states’ rights , the Fugitive Slave Act showed that slaveholders were willing to use the power of the federal government to bend people in other states to their will .	0	history
 2335 . The Democrats divided along sectional lines as a result of the bill , and the Whig party , in decline in the early 1850s , found its political power slipping further .	0	history
 Most important , the Kansas - Nebraska Act gave rise to the Republican Party , a new political party that attracted northern Whigs , Democrats who shunned the Kansas - Nebraska Act , members of the Free - Soil Party , and assorted abolitionists .	0	history
 Indeed , with the formation of the Republican Party , the Free - Soil Party ceased to exist .	0	history
 2338 . The electoral contest in 1856 took place in a transformed political landscape .	0	history
 A third political party appeared : the anti - immigrant American Party , a formerly secretive organization with the nickname “ the Know - Nothing Party ” because its members denied knowing anything about it .	0	history
 By 1856 , the American or Know - Nothing Party had evolved into a national force committed to halting further immigration .	0	history
 2341 . Douglas responded to Lincoln during the second debate at Freeport , Illinois .	0	history
 In what became known as the Freeport Doctrine , Douglas adamantly upheld popular sovereignty , declaring : “ It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the Constitution , the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please . ” The Freeport Doctrine antagonized southerners and caused a major rift in the Democratic Party .	1	history
 The doctrine did help Douglas in Illinois , however , where most voters opposed the further expansion of slavery .	0	history
 2344 . Despite the ruptures and tensions , by the 1860s , some hope of healing the nation still existed .	0	history
 Before Lincoln took office , John Crittenden , a senator from Kentucky who had helped form the Constitutional Union Party during the 1860 presidential election , attempted to defuse the explosive situation by offering six constitutional amendments and a series of resolutions , known as the Crittenden Compromise .	0	history
 Crittenden ’s goal was to keep the South from seceding , and his strategy was to transform the Constitution to explicitly protect slavery forever .	0	history
 2347 . Meanwhile , Lincoln and military leaders in the North hoped a quick blow to the South , especially if they could capture the Confederacy ’s new capital of Richmond , Virginia , would end the rebellion before it went any further .	0	history
 On July 21 , 1861 , the two armies met near Manassas , Virginia , along Bull Run Creek , only thirty miles from Washington , DC .	0	history
 So great was the belief that this would be a climactic Union victory that many Washington socialites and politicians brought picnic lunches to a nearby area , hoping to witness history unfolding before them .	0	history
 2350 . The Union army ’s inability to destroy Lee ’s army at Antietam made it clear to Lincoln that McClellan would never win the war , and the president was forced to seek a replacement .	0	history
 Lincoln wanted someone who could deliver a decisive Union victory .	0	history
 2353 . Over the objections of slaveholders , it impressed slaves , seizing these workers from their owners and forcing them to work on fortifications and rail lines .	0	history
 Concerned about the resistance to and unhappiness with the government measures , in 1862 , the Confederate Congress gave President Davis the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus , the right of those arrested to be brought before a judge or court to determine whether there is cause to hold the prisoner .	1	history
 With a stated goal of bolstering national security in the fledgling republic , this change meant that the Confederacy could arrest and detain indefinitely any suspected enemy without giving a reason .	0	history
 2356 . Since the beginning of the war , thousands of slaves had fled to the safety of Union lines .	1	history
 In May 1861 , Union general Benjamin Butler and others labeled these refugees from slavery contrabands .	0	history
 Butler reasoned that since Southern states had left the United States , he was not obliged to follow federal fugitive slave laws .	0	history
 2359 . In keeping with the logic of total war , Sherman ’s forces cut a swath of destruction to Savannah .	0	history
 On Sherman ’s March to the Sea , the Union army , seeking to demoralize the South , destroyed everything in its path , despite strict instructions regarding the preservation of civilian property .	1	history
 Although towns were left standing , houses and barns were burned .	0	history
 2362 . The end of the Civil War saw the beginning of the Reconstruction era , when former rebel Southern states were integrated back into the Union .	1	history
 President Lincoln moved quickly to achieve the war ’s ultimate goal : reunification of the country .	0	history
 2365 . In February 1864 , two of the Radical Republicans , Ohio senator Benjamin Wade and Maryland representative Henry Winter Davis , answered Lincoln with a proposal of their own .	0	history
 Among other stipulations , the Wade - Davis Bill called for a majority of voters and government officials in Confederate states to take an oath , called the Ironclad Oath , swearing that they had never supported the Confederacy or made war against the United States .	1	history
 Those who could not or would not take the oath would be unable to take part in the future political life of the South .	0	history
 2368 . In this endeavor , the Freedmen ’s Bureau received support from Christian organizations that had long advocated for abolition , such as the American Missionary Association ( AMA ) .	0	history
 The AMA used the knowledge and skill it had acquired while working in missions in Africa and with American Indian groups to establish and run schools for freed slaves in the postwar South .	1	history
 2371 . The 1867 Military Reconstruction Act , which encompassed the vision of Radical Republicans , set a new direction for Reconstruction in the South .	0	history
 Republicans saw this law , and three supplementary laws passed by Congress that year , called the Reconstruction Acts , as a way to deal with the disorder in the South .	0	history
 The 1867 act divided the ten southern states that had yet to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment into five military districts ( Tennessee had already been readmitted to the Union by this time and so was excluded from these acts ) .	0	history
 2374 . While they no longer faced relentless toil under the lash , freed people emerged from slavery without any money and needed farm implements , food , and other basic necessities to start their new lives .	0	history
 Under the crop - lien system , store owners extended credit to farmers under the agreement that the debtors would pay with a portion of their future harvest .	1	history
 However , the creditors charged high interest rates , making it even harder for freed people to gain economic independence .	0	history
 2377 . Despite the great variety in Klan membership , on the whole , the group tended to direct its attention toward persecuting freed people and people they considered carpetbaggers , a term of abuse applied to northerners accused of having come to the South to acquire wealth through political power at the expense of southerners .	1	history
 The colorful term captured the disdain of southerners for these people , reflecting the common assumption that these men , sensing great opportunity , packed up all their worldly possessions in carpetbags , a then - popular type of luggage , and made their way to the South .	1	history
 2380 . Many white southerners felt humiliated by the process of Radical Reconstruction and the way Republicans had upended southern society , placing blacks in positions of authority while taxing large landowners to pay for the education of former slaves .	0	history
 Those committed to rolling back the tide of Radical Reconstruction in the South called themselves redeemers , a label that expressed their desire to redeem their states from northern control and to restore the antebellum social order whereby blacks were kept safely under the boot heel of whites .	1	history
 They represented the Democratic Party in the South and worked tirelessly to end what they saw as an era of “ negro misrule . ” By 1877 , they had succeeded in bringing about the “ redemption ” of the South , effectively destroying the dream of Radical Reconstruction .	0	history
 2383 . The Homestead Act allowed any head of household , or individual over the age of twenty - one — including unmarried women — to receive a parcel of 160 acres for only a nominal filing fee .	1	history
 All that recipients were required to do in exchange was to “ improve the land ” within a period of five years of taking possession .	0	history
 2386 . Similar advancements in hay mowers , manure spreaders , and threshing machines greatly improved farm production for those who could afford them .	0	history
 Where capital expense became a significant factor , larger commercial farms — known as “ bonanza farms”—began to develop .	1	history
 Farmers in Minnesota , North Dakota , and South Dakota hired migrant farmers to grow wheat on farms in excess of twenty thousand acres each .	0	history
 2389 . One example of the violence that bubbled up was the infamous Fence Cutting War in Clay County , Texas ( 1883–1884 ) .	0	history
 There , cowboys began destroying fences that several ranchers erected along public lands : land they had no right to enclose .	0	history
 2392 . A more effective means with which to address the public perception of the “ Indian threat ” was needed .	0	history
 Americanization provided the answer .	0	history
 2395 . Although Thomas Alva Edison ( [ link ] ) is best known for his contributions to the electrical industry , his experimentation went far beyond the light bulb .	0	history
 Edison was quite possibly the greatest inventor of the turn of the century , saying famously that he “ hoped to have a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every month or so . ” He registered 1,093 patents over his lifetime and ran a world - famous laboratory , Menlo Park , which housed a rotating group of up to twenty - five scientists from around the globe .	0	history
 2398 . Rockefeller was ruthless in his pursuit of total control of the oil refining business .	0	history
 As other entrepreneurs flooded the area seeking a quick fortune , Rockefeller developed a plan to crush his competitors and create a true monopoly in the refining industry .	0	history
 Beginning in 1872 , he forged agreements with several large railroad companies to obtain discounted freight rates for shipping his product .	0	history
 2401 . In order to control the variety of interests he now maintained in industry , Rockefeller created a new legal entity , known as a trust .	0	history
 In this arrangement , a small group of trustees possess legal ownership of a business that they operate for the benefit of other investors .	1	history
 2404 . In the 1870s , Irish coal miners in eastern Pennsylvania formed a secret organization known as the Molly Maguires , named for the famous Irish patriot .	1	history
 Through a series of scare tactics that included kidnappings , beatings , and even murder , the Molly Maguires sought to bring attention to the miners’ plight , as well as to cause enough damage and concern to the mine owners that the owners would pay attention to their concerns .	0	history
 2407 . Churches and civic organizations provided some relief to the challenges of working - class city life .	0	history
 Churches were moved to intervene through their belief in the concept of the social gospel .	0	history
 This philosophy stated that all Christians , whether they were church leaders or social reformers , should be as concerned about the conditions of life in the secular world as the afterlife , and the Reverend Washington Gladden was a major advocate .	1	history
 2410 . One example of a machine political system was the Democratic political machine Tammany Hall in New York , run by machine boss William Tweed with assistance from George Washington Plunkitt ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 There , citizens knew their immediate problems would be addressed in return for their promise of political support in future elections .	0	history
 2413 . While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of funds to find anyplace better , and the wealthy class chose to remain in the cities to stay close to the action of big business transactions , the emerging middle class responded to urban challenges with their own solutions .	0	history
 This group included the managers , salesmen , engineers , doctors , accountants , and other salaried professionals who still worked for a living , but were significantly better educated and compensated than the working - class poor .	0	history
 4919 . Profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs , like labor or raw materials , the firm needs to buy .	0	economic
 Aggregate supply ( AS ) refers to the total quantity of output ( i.e .	1	economic
 real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .	1	economic
 4922 . When an economy is operating at its potential GDP , machines and factories are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 For this reason , potential GDP is sometimes also called full - employment GDP .	0	economic
 4925 . The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world .	0	economic
 U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .	0	economic
 U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .	0	economic
 4928 . For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 4931 . For example , the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975 , 1980–1982 , 1990–91 , 2001 , and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices .	0	economic
 In the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation . Conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs .	0	economic
 From 1985 to 1986 , for example , the average price of crude oil fell by almost half , from $ 24 a barrel to $ 12 a barrel .	0	economic
 4934 . If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion . Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too .	0	economic
 Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to diminish it .	0	economic
 Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment .	0	economic
 4937 . Two types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter .	0	economic
 Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short - run movements of GDP .	1	economic
 Over the long run , in the United States , the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5 % ( give or take one percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy .	0	economic
 4940 . Focus first on the Keynesian zone , that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat .	1	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow .	0	economic
 4943 . The idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell .	0	economic
 Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy .	1	economic
 This point is illustrated in [ link].The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output .	0	economic
 4946 . As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .	0	economic
 The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services .	1	economic
 ( Aggregate demand ( AD ) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure .	0	economic
 4949 . Spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure .	1	economic
 Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) .	0	economic
 4952 . ) Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects .	1	economic
 The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks .	0	economic
 First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 4955 . Second , frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected .	1	economic
 These costs of changing prices are called menu costs — like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant .	0	economic
 Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time .	0	economic
 4958 . Thus , when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP .	0	economic
 The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .	0	economic
 4961 . Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 This pattern became known as stagflation .	0	economic
 ( Recall from The Aggregate Demand / Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation . )	1	economic
 4964 . He proposed that the government could bury money underground , and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again .	0	economic
 These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP .	0	economic
 4967 . The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output .	0	economic
 4970 . Actual or real GDP is benchmarked against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing .	0	economic
 Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 4973 . Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand .	0	economic
 Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right .	0	economic
 4976 . After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works .	0	economic
 An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory .	1	economic
 If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut .	0	economic
 4979 . The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve .	0	economic
 The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run .	0	economic
 4982 . Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment .	0	economic
 Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low .	0	economic
 4985 . However , the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years .	0	economic
 Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s .	0	economic
 Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment .	0	economic
 4988 . At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .	0	economic
 We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .	0	economic
 With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing .	1	economic
 4991 . ( We will get to its definition soon . )	0	economic
 First , money serves as a medium of exchange , which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller .	0	economic
 Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes , the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money .	0	economic
 4994 . Finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment .	0	economic
 This means that if money is usable today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future .	1	economic
 4997 . Of course , gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry . As commodity money , gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account .	0	economic
 Commodity - backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank .	1	economic
 During much of its history , the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver .	0	economic
 5000 . less liquid . The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity .	1	economic
 There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 5003 . A broader definition of money , M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits .	0	economic
 For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	0	economic
 5006 . Where does “ plastic money ” like debit cards , credit cards , and smart money fit into this picture ?	0	economic
 A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller .	1	economic
 It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 5009 . One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts .	0	economic
 Indeed , the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system .	0	economic
 The next section explains how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money .	0	economic
 5012 . Banks as Financial IntermediariesAn “ intermediary ” is one who stands between two other parties .	1	economic
 Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	0	economic
 5015 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 5018 . In this case , a home is the asset , but the mortgage is the liability .	0	economic
 The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed ( the liability ) . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	1	economic
 5021 . Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments .	0	economic
 The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market . One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?	1	economic
 The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid , the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan .	0	economic
 5024 . Securitization offers certain advantages .	0	economic
 If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments .	0	economic
 5027 . Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers . How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset - liability time mismatch ?	0	economic
 One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans , which means lending to a variety of customers .	1	economic
 For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area .	0	economic
 5030 . The organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation ’s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank .	1	economic
 Most nations have central banks or currency boards .	0	economic
 5033 . A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 The goal is not only to protect individuals’ savings , but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself .	0	economic
 5036 . Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks .	0	economic
 They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .	1	economic
 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 5039 . The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always straightforward .	0	economic
 As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid .	1	economic
 These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan . The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off .	0	economic
 5042 . About 70 countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs .	0	economic
 In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is responsible for deposit insurance .	1	economic
 Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC .	0	economic
 5045 . The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations .	0	economic
 Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates .	1	economic
 5048 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5051 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 5054 . Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time .	0	economic
 In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise .	0	economic
 5057 . In [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) occurs at an output of 750 , which is above potential GDP .	0	economic
 A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings .	1	economic
 Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens .	0	economic
 5060 . With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .	0	economic
 This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .	1	economic
 5063 . Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit .	0	economic
 For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans .	0	economic
 5066 . Unpredictable Movements of VelocityVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy .	1	economic
 The velocity of money in a year is defined as :	0	economic
 5069 . Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate .	0	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and there is deflation of 2 % , then the real interest rate is actually 9 % .	0	economic
 5072 . So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 .	0	economic
 Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking , M2 is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1 .	0	economic
 5075 . In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .	0	economic
 If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment .	0	economic
 From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy .	0	economic
 5078 . Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .	0	economic
 For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment .	0	economic
 5081 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 5084 . This chapter discusses the international dimension of money , which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate .	0	economic
 An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand .	1	economic
 The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5087 . You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters .	0	economic
 In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies .	0	economic
 These earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature .	0	economic
 5090 . The other kind of international financial investment , portfolio investment , involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility .	1	economic
 An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom , or deposited money in a British bank .	0	economic
 5093 . These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .	0	economic
 This is called the interbank market .	0	economic
 5096 . The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos .	0	economic
 Note that the two exchange rates are inverses : 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso ( or $ 0.10 per peso ) .	0	economic
 5099 . If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars .	0	economic
 This is known as arbitrage , the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit .	1	economic
 It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries .	0	economic
 5102 . A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country .	0	economic
 Let ’s discuss these scenarios in turn . Exchange Rates , Aggregate Demand , and Aggregate Supply	0	economic
 5105 . In 1997–1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more .	0	economic
 These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital , with bank lending increasing by 20 % to 30 % per year through the mid-1990s .	0	economic
 When their exchange rates depreciated , the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt .	0	economic
 5108 . A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate .	1	economic
 The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate , as are the currencies of about 40 % of the countries in the world economy .	0	economic
 5111 . When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency .	1	economic
 A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 5114 . The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency .	0	economic
 In this way , it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency .	0	economic
 5117 . For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg .	0	economic
 With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate .	0	economic
 With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg .	0	economic
 5120 . Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment .	0	economic
 5123 . But proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties .	0	economic
 Taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones .	0	economic
 5126 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5129 . When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .	1	economic
 Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 5132 . When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .	0	economic
 The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue . The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .	0	economic
 Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time .	0	economic
 5135 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5138 . The federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue .	0	economic
 It imposes an excise tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .	1	economic
 As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 5141 . Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits .	0	economic
 The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows the ratio of debt / GDP since 1940 .	0	economic
 5144 . The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries .	0	economic
 Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels .	1	economic
 The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 5147 . In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past .	0	economic
 On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ” The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”This happy consensus , however , did not last .	0	economic
 The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 .	0	economic
 5150 . It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip .	0	economic
 The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag .	1	economic
 After this lag , policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills .	0	economic
 5153 . Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement .	0	economic
 After all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers .	0	economic
 5156 . The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded . The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings . Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .	1	economic
 5159 . If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .	0	economic
 When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out . To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .	1	economic
 In 2005 , for example , the budget deficit was roughly 4 % of GDP .	0	economic
 5162 . Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment .	0	economic
 If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 5165 . Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education .	0	economic
 If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role .	0	economic
 5168 . Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar , measured in euros .	0	economic
 At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s ) .	0	economic
 5171 . You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .	0	economic
 As explained in The Macroeconomic Perspective , we must consider using purchasing power parity or “ international dollars ” to convert average incomes into comparable units .	0	economic
 Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries . The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution .	0	economic
 5174 . Where does economic growth come from ?	0	economic
 According to most economists who believe in the growth consensus , economic growth ( as discussed in Economic Growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements .	0	economic
 In turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all interacting in a market - driven economy .	0	economic
 5177 . Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital .	0	economic
 Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty . For example , the average citizen of Burundi , the lowest - income country , subsists on $ 150 per year ( adjusted to 2005 dollars ) .	0	economic
 According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop .	0	economic
 5180 . The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 5183 . Policymakers of the high - income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation .	0	economic
 First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term .	0	economic
 5186 . There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns .	0	economic
 These arguments are discussed at some length in The International Trade and Capital Flows . Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade , perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument ; that is , subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established .	1	economic
 ( Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail . )	0	economic
 5189 . Instead of offering net financial investment abroad , the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world .	0	economic
 These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research .	0	economic
 While trade deficits on their own are not bad , the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily .	0	economic
 5192 . The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I .	0	economic
 Over that time , global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1 % of GDP in 1820 to 9 % of GDP in 1913 .	0	economic
 5195 . A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good .	1	economic
 Absolute advantage can be the result of a country ’s natural endowment .	0	economic
 5198 . To simplify , let ’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours ( see [ link ] ) .	0	economic
 We illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) graph , shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources , in this case workers , and its level of technology .	0	economic
 5201 . Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries .	0	economic
 It answers the question , “ How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico ? ” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently .	0	economic
 5204 . Moreover , the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain products , and then exchange those products .	1	economic
 A high proportion of trade , however , is intra - industry trade — that is , trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another .	1	economic
 For example , the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos .	0	economic
 5207 . In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain .	0	economic
 The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .	0	economic
 As indicated in the beginning of the chapter , the production of the iPhone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the United States , parts supplied from Korea , the assembly of the parts in China , and the advertising and marketing done in the United States .	0	economic
 5210 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .	1	economic
 Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .	0	economic
 5213 . When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism .	1	economic
 Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition .	0	economic
 5216 . Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules , regulations , inspections , and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products .	1	economic
 A rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas , for instance .	0	economic
 1515 . The adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys ; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla .	1	biology
 1518 . The pancreas , illustrated in [ link ] , is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine .	1	biology
 It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones .	1	biology
 1521 . The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells .	0	biology
 These cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) in response to increased blood volume .	0	biology
 High blood volume causes the cells to be stretched , resulting in hormone release .	0	biology
 1524 . EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance , as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance .	0	biology
 Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood , artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks . The thymus is found behind the sternum ; it is most prominent in infants , becoming smaller in size through adulthood .	1	biology
 The thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins , which contribute to the development of the immune response .	0	biology
 1527 . The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys .	0	biology
 1530 . In contrast to ADH , which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance , aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules .	1	biology
 Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+ , aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid , a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance .	1	biology
 Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels , blood volume , or blood pressure , or an increase in blood potassium levels .	0	biology
 1533 . During puberty in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , which stimulates the production and release of follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 These hormones regulate the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) and therefore are called gonadotropins .	1	biology
 In both males and females , FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads .	0	biology
 1536 . Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth .	1	biology
 Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .	0	biology
 PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .	0	biology
 1539 . Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus , the main symptoms of which are illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .	0	biology
 1545 . The basal metabolic rate , which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest , is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland : thyroxine , also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4 , and triiodothyronine , also known as T3 .	1	biology
 These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain , uterus , testes , blood cells , and spleen .	0	biology
 1548 . Inadequate iodine intake , which occurs in many developing countries , results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4 hormones .	0	biology
 The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter , which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone .	1	biology
 Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid , and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid .	0	biology
 1551 . Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which is produced by the parathyroid glands , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2 + levels .	0	biology
 1554 . This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids .	1	biology
 This process is called a glucose - sparing effect .	0	biology
 In another direct mechanism , GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver ; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose .	0	biology
 1557 . A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development .	0	biology
 Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities , but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism , in which growth is reduced .	1	biology
 Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation .	0	biology
 1560 . The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .	1	biology
 The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .	0	biology
 1563 . They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism .	0	biology
 There are two main corticosteroids : glucocorticoids such as cortisol , and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone .	0	biology
 These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue .	0	biology
 1566 . This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck , and excessive glucose in the blood .	0	biology
 Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison ’s disease , which may result in bronzing of the skin , hypoglycemia , and low electrolyte levels in the blood .	1	biology
 1572 . The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain .	0	biology
 The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .	0	biology
 1575 . The auditory ossicles consist of three bones each : the malleus , incus , and stapes .	0	biology
 These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals . Fourteen facial bones form the face , provide cavities for the sense organs ( eyes , mouth , and nose ) , protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts , and serve as attachment points for facial muscles .	1	biology
 The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones , the maxillary bones , zygomatic bones , palatine , vomer , lacrimal bones , the inferior nasal conchae , and the mandible .	0	biology
 1578 . Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum .	1	biology
 Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running .	0	biology
 1581 . It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult .	0	biology
 The ribs are 12 pairs of long , curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body , forming the ribcage .	1	biology
 Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum , with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12 , which are free - floating ribs .	1	biology
 1584 . The clavicles are S - shaped bones that position the arms on the body .	1	biology
 The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax ( chest ) just above the first rib .	0	biology
 1587 . An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined .	1	biology
 The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm .	1	biology
 It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .	0	biology
 1590 . The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .	1	biology
 The ulna is located on the medial aspect ( pinky - finger side ) of the forearm .	1	biology
 It is longer than the radius .	0	biology
 1593 . The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones .	0	biology
 In adults , the hip bones , or coxal bones , are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones : the ilium , ischium , and pubis .	1	biology
 The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body .	0	biology
 1596 . At the distal end , the femur , tibia , and patella form the knee joint .	1	biology
 The patella , or kneecap , is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint .	1	biology
 The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors ( quadriceps ) .	1	biology
 1599 . The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle .	1	biology
 The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .	1	biology
 1605 . The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers .	0	biology
 Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets ; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament .	0	biology
 1608 . Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children .	1	biology
 In symphyses , hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage .	0	biology
 Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae .	1	biology
 1611 . This includes sutures , gomphoses , and synchondroses .	0	biology
 Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .	1	biology
 Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .	1	biology
 1614 . Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes .	1	biology
 There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .	0	biology
 1620 . Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction .	1	biology
 Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion , as in moving the arm in a circular motion .	1	biology
 1629 . Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .	1	biology
 Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .	1	biology
 Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 1632 . Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	1	biology
 Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .	1	biology
 1635 . In hinge joints , the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone .	1	biology
 In this way , one bone moves while the other remains stationary , like the hinge of a door .	0	biology
 1638 . Saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle , with concave and convex portions that fit together .	1	biology
 Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion .	0	biology
 1641 . The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins ( actin and myosin ) .	0	biology
 Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell .	0	biology
 1644 . These cells are incredibly large , with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths of up to 30 cm .	0	biology
 The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma .	1	biology
 The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .	0	biology
 1647 . Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments .	1	biology
 There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .	0	biology
 1650 . To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin , regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites .	0	biology
 Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .	1	biology
 Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .	0	biology
 1653 . ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) into acetyl and choline .	0	biology
 AChE resides in the synaptic cleft , breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors , which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1656 . Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .	1	biology
 The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	0	biology
 1659 . Short bones , or cuboidal bones , are bones that are the same width and length , giving them a cube - like shape .	1	biology
 For example , the bones of the wrist ( carpals ) and ankle ( tarsals ) are short bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1662 . Sesamoid bones are small , flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed .	1	biology
 The patellae are sesamoid bones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1665 . Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems .	0	biology
 Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi , which transport blood . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .	1	biology
 1668 . Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones , spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones .	0	biology
 Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .	1	biology
 1671 . Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes .	0	biology
 Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei .	1	biology
 They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix .	0	biology
 1674 . Ossification , or osteogenesis , is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts .	1	biology
 Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification ; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones , it can also occur in other tissues .	0	biology
 1677 . Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone .	0	biology
 Until adolescence , hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate ( growth plate ) , which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1680 . In mammals , pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation ( breathing ) .	0	biology
 During inhalation , air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 As air passes through the nasal cavity , the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified .	0	biology
 1683 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 1686 . Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction ( parasympathetic ) or relaxation ( sympathetic ) in the bronchi and bronchioles , depending on the nervous system ’s cues .	0	biology
 In humans , bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles .	1	biology
 They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 1689 . In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .	0	biology
 At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .	1	biology
 Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli .	0	biology
 1692 . Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases .	1	biology
 The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture .	0	biology
 1695 . On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .	0	biology
 The expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 1698 . Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes .	0	biology
 The vital capacity ( VC ) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1701 . The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 Lastly , the total lung capacity ( TLC ) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold .	1	biology
 It is the sum of the residual volume , expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1704 . In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .	1	biology
 The ratio of these values ( FEV1/FVC ratio ) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma , emphysema , and fibrosis .	0	biology
 If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high , the lungs are not compliant ( meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly ) , and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis .	0	biology
 1707 . The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs .	0	biology
 The lungs are elastic ; therefore , when air fills the lungs , the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs .	0	biology
 These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath .	0	biology
 1710 . The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .	1	biology
 Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .	1	biology
 1713 . There are two types of work conducted during respiration , flow - resistive and elastic work .	0	biology
 Flow - resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung , whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles , chest wall , and diaphragm .	1	biology
 Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow - resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles .	0	biology
 1716 . Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs .	0	biology
 Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance ( how elastic the lung is ) and resistance ( how much obstruction exists in the airways ) .	1	biology
 A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 1719 . Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema , asthma , and pulmonary edema .	0	biology
 In emphysema , which mostly arises from smoking tobacco , the walls of the alveoli are destroyed , decreasing the surface area for gas exchange .	1	biology
 1722 . There are two types of V / Q mismatch .	0	biology
 Both produce dead space , regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue .	1	biology
 Dead spaces can severely impact breathing , because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion .	0	biology
 1725 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .	0	biology
 Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red .	0	biology
 1728 . Increased temperature , such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle , causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced . Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood ’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen - carrying capacity .	0	biology
 In sickle cell anemia , the shape of the red blood cell is crescent - shaped , elongated , and stiffened , reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In this form , red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries .	0	biology
 1731 . Third , the majority of carbon dioxide molecules ( 85 percent ) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system .	0	biology
 In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	1	biology
 1734 . In all vertebrate organisms , as well as some invertebrates , this is a closed - loop system , in which the blood is not free in a cavity .	0	biology
 In a closed circulatory system , blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route , then returns to the heart again , as illustrated in [ link]a .	1	biology
 As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 1737 . As illustrated in [ link]a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two - chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle .	0	biology
 The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	0	biology
 1740 . The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .	1	biology
 In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .	0	biology
 1743 . The blood is more than the proteins , though .	0	biology
 Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma ( the liquid portion , which contains water , proteins , salts , lipids , and glucose ) and the cells ( red and white cells ) and cell fragments called platelets .	1	biology
 Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water , proteins , electrolytes , lipids , and glucose .	0	biology
 1746 . The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum .	1	biology
 Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves .	0	biology
 1749 . The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .	1	biology
 After it is filled , the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries , by - passing the semilunar valve ( or pulmonic valve ) to the lungs for re - oxygenation .	0	biology
 After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries , the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle .	0	biology
 1752 . The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .	0	biology
 The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1755 . The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .	1	biology
 They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .	0	biology
 The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 1758 . The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body ; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle .	0	biology
 The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax .	1	biology
 The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 1761 . The electrical signals and mechanical actions , illustrated in [ link ] , are intimately intertwined .	0	biology
 The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , which is located near the wall of the right atrium .	0	biology
 Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison .	0	biology
 1764 . The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs .	1	biology
 The major arteries diverge into minor arteries , and then smaller vessels called arterioles , to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body .	0	biology
 1767 . The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .	0	biology
 Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .	1	biology
 The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply .	0	biology
 1770 . The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava .	0	biology
 Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells .	1	biology
 The white blood cells remove infectious agents , such as bacteria and viruses , to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream .	0	biology
 1773 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 1776 . An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .	0	biology
 Both electrolytes and non - electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance .	0	biology
 1779 . Thus , one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams .	0	biology
 The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 1782 . When they move to a hypertonic marine environment , these fish start drinking sea water ; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 Most marine invertebrates , on the other hand , may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers ) .	0	biology
 Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration .	0	biology
 1785 . Externally , the kidneys are surrounded by three layers , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 1788 . The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	0	biology
 Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .	0	biology
 The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 1791 . The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .	0	biology
 The tips of the pyramids , called renal papillae , point toward the renal pelvis .	0	biology
 1794 . The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	0	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1797 . Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .	0	biology
 The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 1800 . The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .	0	biology
 Cortical radiate arteries , as the name suggests , radiate out from the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles , and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons .	1	biology
 1803 . The renal corpuscle , located in the renal cortex , is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule , a cup - shaped chamber that surrounds it , called the glomerular or Bowman 's capsule .	1	biology
 1806 . The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	1	biology
 The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids .	1	biology
 1809 . Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .	1	biology
 Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule .	0	biology
 In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	0	biology
 1812 . Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .	0	biology
 Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption .	1	biology
 In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network .	0	biology
 5602 . Despite the ongoing economic recovery , the job market is actually growing in some areas , but in a very polarized fashion .	0	sociology
 Polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market , with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education .	1	sociology
 At one end , there has been strong demand for low - skilled , low - paying jobs in industries like food service and retail .	0	sociology
 5608 . For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations .	1	sociology
 This can lead to a sense of xenophobia , which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods .	1	sociology
 Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of this risk and attempt to “ Americanize ” their products , selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were nevertheless made in Mexico .	0	sociology
 5611 . Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .	0	sociology
 Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .	1	sociology
 The complex U.S. economy , and the economies of other industrialized nations , meet the definition of organic solidarity .	0	sociology
 5614 . Governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called mercantilism .	0	sociology
 Mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges .	1	sociology
 The resulting restrictive practices and exacting demands included monopolies , bans on certain goods , high tariffs , and exclusivity requirements .	0	sociology
 5617 . Socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership ( often referred to as “ state run ” ) of goods and their production , with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the members of a society .	1	sociology
 Under socialism , everything that people produce , including services , is considered a social product .	0	sociology
 5620 . Convergence theory explains that as a country 's economy grows , its societal organization changes to become more like that of an industrialized society .	1	sociology
 Rather than staying in one job for a lifetime , people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise .	0	sociology
 5623 . Those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society .	0	sociology
 They focus on the way reality is socially constructed through day - to - day interaction and how society is composed of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols . One important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career inheritance .	0	sociology
 This concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as their parents , which is a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies ( Antony 1998 ) .	1	sociology
 5626 . Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing .	1	sociology
 A caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives .	1	sociology
 People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents , interests , or potential .	0	sociology
 5632 . Status ConsistencySocial stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income , education , and occupation .	0	sociology
 Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency , or lack thereof , of an individual ’s rank across these factors .	1	sociology
 Caste systems correlate with high status consistency , whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency .	0	sociology
 5635 . Social MobilitySocial mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system .	1	sociology
 When people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class , they experience social mobility .	0	sociology
 5638 . Dropping out of school , losing a job , or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and , therefore , downward social mobility . It is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes .	1	sociology
 This is known as intergenerational mobility .	0	sociology
 For example , an upper - class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class .	0	sociology
 5641 . Class traits , also called class markers , are the typical behaviors , customs , and norms that define each class .	1	sociology
 Class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures .	0	sociology
 5644 . To symbolically communicate social standing , people often engage in conspicuous consumption , which is the purchase and use of certain products to make a social statement about status .	1	sociology
 Carrying pricey but eco - friendly water bottles could indicate a person ’s social standing .	0	sociology
 5647 . While stratification in the United States refers to the unequal distribution of resources among individuals , global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations .	0	sociology
 There are two dimensions to this stratification : gaps between nations and gaps within nations .	0	sociology
 5650 . The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .	1	sociology
 The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .	1	sociology
 Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .	0	sociology
 5653 . For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .	0	sociology
 We can look at free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) as an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in the matter of global trade . Peripheral nations have very little industrialization ; what they do have often represents the outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations .	0	sociology
 They typically have unstable governments , inadequate social programs , and are economically dependent on core nations for jobs and aid .	0	sociology
 5656 . Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b).High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .	0	sociology
 Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .	1	sociology
 Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .	1	sociology
 5659 . Social scientists define global poverty in different ways and take into account the complexities and the issues of relativism described above .	0	sociology
 Relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford necessities but are unable to meet their society ’s average standard of living .	1	sociology
 People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .	0	sociology
 5662 . What do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in New York , a piecework seamstress working from her home in Mumbai , and a street tortilla vendor in Mexico City have in common ?	0	sociology
 They are all members of the underground economy , a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by taxes , government permits , or human protections .	1	sociology
 Official statistics before the worldwide recession posit that the underground economy accounted for over 50 percent of nonagricultural work in Latin America ; the figure went as high as 80 percent in parts of Asia and Africa ( Chen 2001 ) .	0	sociology
 5665 . According to modernization theory , low - income countries are affected by their lack of industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through ( Armer and Katsillis 2010):an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work	1	sociology
 5668 . Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions ( Mongolia and the Caucus Mountains , for instance ) or skin tones ( black , white , yellow , and red , for example).Social science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists , the American Sociological Association , and the American Psychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race .	0	sociology
 Over time , the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse , and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories .	0	sociology
 Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned , based on pseudoscience , and used to justify racist practices ( Omi and Winant 1994 ; Graves 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5671 . Scapegoat theory , developed initially from Dollard ’s ( 1939 ) Frustration - Aggression theory , suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group .	1	sociology
 History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group .	0	sociology
 5674 . A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .	1	sociology
 A 1970 documentary called Eye of the Storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops , by showing how defining one category of people as superior ( children with blue eyes ) results in prejudice against people who are not part of the favored category . While prejudice is not necessarily specific to race , racism is a stronger type of prejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior or inferior to others ; it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to disadvantage a racial minority .	1	sociology
 The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .	0	sociology
 5677 . While prejudice refers to biased thinking , discrimination consists of actions against a group of people .	1	sociology
 Discrimination can be based on age , religion , health , and other indicators ; race - based laws against discrimination strive to address this set of social problems .	0	sociology
 5680 . In the days after , it was revealed that only three members of the town ’s fifty - three - member police force were black ( Nobles and Bosman 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks , with some commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial inequality and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community , in local political establishments , and in the police force ( Bouie 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 Redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities , while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to accumulate wealth .	1	sociology
 5683 . Culture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture .	1	sociology
 We grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice .	0	sociology
 5686 . Segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups , particularly in residence , but also in workplace and social functions .	1	sociology
 It is important to distinguish between de jure segregation ( segregation that is enforced by law ) and de facto segregation ( segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors ) .	1	sociology
 5689 . Amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group .	1	sociology
 Amalgamation creates the classic “ melting pot ” analogy ; unlike the “ salad bowl , ” in which each culture retains its individuality , the “ melting pot ” ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely . Amalgamation , also known as miscegenation , is achieved through intermarriage between races .	0	sociology
 5692 . Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity .	1	sociology
 Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male . A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Therefore , the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable .	0	sociology
 5695 . Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation .	0	sociology
 Some is based on heterosexism , which Herek ( 1990 ) suggests is both an ideology and a set of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over other sexual orientations .	1	sociology
 Much like racism and sexism , heterosexism is a systematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions , offering power to those who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously disadvantaging those who do not .	0	sociology
 5698 . To a certain extent , men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity .	0	sociology
 Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .	1	sociology
" 5701 . Gender Dysphoria , on the other hand , removes some of that stigma by taking the word "" disorder "" out while maintaining a category that will protect patient access to care , including hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery ."	0	sociology
 In the DSM-5 , Gender Dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with .	1	sociology
 For a person to be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria , there must be a marked difference between the individual ’s expressed / experienced gender and the gender others would assign him or her , and it must continue for at least six months .	0	sociology
 5704 . In other words , both gender and sexuality are socially constructed .	0	sociology
 The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .	1	sociology
 This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .	0	sociology
 5707 . Queer TheoryQueer Theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies Western society ’s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual orientation .	1	sociology
 According to Jagose ( 1996 ) , Queer [ Theory ] focuses on mismatches between anatomical sex , gender identity , and sexual orientation , not just division into male / female or homosexual / hetereosexual .	0	sociology
 5710 . Gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges encountered as seniors grow older .	1	sociology
 Gerontologists investigate age , aging , and the aged .	0	sociology
 5719 . Each person experiences age - related changes based on many factors .	0	sociology
 Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging , while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging ( Whitbourne and Whitbourne 2010 ) .	1	sociology
 5722 . Should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity ?	0	sociology
 Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician - assisted suicide : the voluntary or physician - assisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one ’s life .	1	sociology
 This right to have a doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial .	0	sociology
 5725 . He did n’t intend to treat people differently based on personal or cultural biases , but he did .	0	sociology
 Ageism is discrimination ( when someone acts on a prejudice ) based on age .	1	sociology
 Dr. Robert Butler coined the term in 1968 , noting that ageism exists in all cultures ( Brownell ) .	0	sociology
 5731 . There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective .	0	sociology
 Modernization theory ( Cowgill and Holmes 1972 ) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization .	1	sociology
 As societies modernize , the status of elders decreases , and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion .	0	sociology
 5734 . One microanalytical theory is Rose ’s ( 1962 ) subculture of aging theory , which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded ( due to age ) , voluntarily or involuntarily , from participating in other groups .	1	sociology
 This theory suggests that elders will disengage from society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and interests .	0	sociology
 5740 . A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .	0	sociology
 A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .	0	sociology
 These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage . Drawing on two sociological paradigms , the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism .	0	sociology
 5743 . In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage .	0	sociology
 In a majority of cultures ( 78 percent ) , polygamy , or being married to more than one person at a time , is accepted ( Murdock 1967 ) , with most polygamous societies existing in northern Africa and east Asia ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .	1	sociology
 Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .	0	sociology
 5746 . In the United States , polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal .	0	sociology
 The act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states .	1	sociology
 Polygamy in the United States is often associated with those of the Mormon faith , although in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy .	0	sociology
 5749 . Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .	0	sociology
 Unilateral descent ( the tracing of kinship through one parent only ) is practiced in the other 40 percent of the world ’s societies , with high concentration in pastoral cultures ( O’Neal 2006 ) .	1	sociology
 5752 . Patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and community ; it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives .	0	sociology
 In China , where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common , the written symbols for maternal grandmother ( wáipá ) are separately translated to mean “ outsider ” and “ women ” ( Cohen 2011).Similarly , in matrilocal residence systems , where it is customary for the husband to live with his wife ’s blood relatives ( or her family of orientation ) , the husband can feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider .	1	sociology
 The Minangkabau people , a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of West Sumatra in Indonesia , believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues relating to the home or family ( Joseph and Najmabadi 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5755 . This is a decrease from 77 percent in 1980 ( U.S. Census 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 This two - parent family structure is known as a nuclear family , referring to married parents and children as the nucleus , or core , of the group .	1	sociology
 Recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married .	0	sociology
 5761 . Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .	1	sociology
 Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .	1	sociology
 Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .	0	sociology
 5767 . The term ecclesia , originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens , Greece , now refers to a congregation .	0	sociology
 In sociology , the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to .	1	sociology
 5770 . Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .	1	sociology
 Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .	1	sociology
 It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .	1	sociology
 5773 . A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000 people who attend regular weekly services .	1	sociology
 As of 2009 , the largest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas , boasting an average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 ( Bogan 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 5776 . In contrast , informal education describes learning about cultural values , norms , and expected behaviors by participating in a society .	1	sociology
 This type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home .	0	sociology
 5779 . Education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility .	0	sociology
 This function is referred to as social placement .	0	sociology
 College and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek .	0	sociology
 5782 . Many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence .	0	sociology
 The cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula as well as in the hidden curriculum , which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that students learn through informal learning and cultural transmission .	1	sociology
 This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .	0	sociology
 5785 . The labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees that symbolize completion of education .	0	sociology
 Credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or degrees to show that a person has a certain skill , has attained a certain level of education , or has met certain job qualifications .	1	sociology
 These certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has achieved , and allows the labeling of that individual .	0	sociology
 5788 . opined , “ The measure of a man is what he does with power , ” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted , “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely ” ( 1887 ) .	0	sociology
 Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define . Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) .	1	sociology
 Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments .	0	sociology
 5794 . Most people generally agree that anarchy , or the absence of organized government , does not facilitate a desirable living environment for society , but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the particulars of how a population should be governed .	1	sociology
 Throughout history , various forms of government have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets , each with pros and cons .	0	sociology
 5797 . In today ’s global political climate , monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies , governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution .	1	sociology
 Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies .	0	sociology
 5800 . The late Kim Jong - Il , North Korean dictator , and his successor , Kim Jong - Un , exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship . Some dictatorships do not align themselves with any particular belief system or ideology ; the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator .	0	sociology
 A totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects’ lives ; including occupation , religious beliefs , and number of children permitted in each family .	1	sociology
 Citizens may be forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches and demonstrations .	0	sociology

 6468 . Winner - take - all systems of electing candidates to office , which exist in several countries other than the United States , require that the winner receive either the majority of votes or a plurality of the votes .	0	government
 U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .	0	government
 Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 6474 . The argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy .	0	government
 Under this model of proportional representation , legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election .	1	government
 As a result , any given election can have multiple winners , and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 Parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections ; their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform ( [ link ] ) , which is adopted at each party ’s presidential nominating convention every four years .	0	government
 If successful , a party can create a large enough electoral coalition to gain control of the government .	0	government
 6519 . Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .	0	government
 The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .	0	government
 6522 . This marked the beginning of what historians call the Second Party System ( the first parties had been the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans ) , with the splitting of the Democratic - Republicans and the formation of two new political parties .	1	government
 One half , called simply the Democratic Party , was the party of Jackson ; it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank .	0	government

 These corporations will either have one or more in - house lobbyists , who work for one interest group or firm and represent their organization in a lobbying capacity , and/or will hire a contract lobbyist , individuals who work for firms that represent a multitude of clients and are often hired because of their resources and their ability to contact and lobby lawmakers , to represent them before the legislature .	1	government
 6543 . Interest groups and organizations represent both private and public interests in the United States .	0	government
 Private interests usually seek particularized benefits from government that favor either a single interest or a narrow set of interests .	1	government

 Tea Party protests , for instance , gave individuals all over the country the opportunity to voice their opposition to government actions and control .	0	government
 Likewise , the Occupy Wall Street movement also gave a voice to those individuals frustrated with economic inequality and the influence of large corporations on the public sector .	0	government
 Individually , the protestors would likely have received little notice , but by joining with others , they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6558 . Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .	0	government
 The Tea Party is an example of a so - called astroturf movement , because it is not , strictly speaking , a grassroots movement .	0	government

 Although its prescribed purpose was to revise the Articles of Confederation , a number of delegates charted a path toward disposing of the Articles entirely .	0	government
 6582 . In the final draft of the U.S. Constitution , the bicameral Congress established by the convention of 1787 was given a number of powers and limitations .	0	government
 These are outlined in Article I ( Appendix B ) .	0	government
 This article describes the minimum age of congresspersons ( Section 2 ) , requires that Congress meet at least once a year ( Section 4 ) , guarantees members’ pay ( Section 6 ) , and gives Congress the power to levy taxes , borrow money , and regulate commerce ( Section 8) .	1	government

 First , the average number of citizens in a congressional district now tops 700,000 .	0	government
 6588 . In general , congressional powers can be divided into three types : enumerated , implied , and inherent .	0	government
 An enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the Constitution .	1	government
 An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 6591 . Article I , Section 8 , of the U.S. Constitution details the enumerated powers of the legislature .	0	government
 These include the power to levy and collect taxes , declare war , raise an army and navy , coin money , borrow money , regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations , establish federal courts and bankruptcy rules , establish rules for immigration and naturalization , and issue patents and copyrights .	0	government
 6594 . But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	0	government
 Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .	0	government
 When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .	0	government
 Instead , the justices took the novel approach of upholding the law based on the Congress ’s enumerated power to tax , rather than the commerce clause .	0	government

 6606 . The amount of money they raise against their challengers demonstrates their advantage .	0	government
 In 2014 , for example , the average Senate incumbent raised $ 12,144,933 , whereas the average challenger raised only $ 1,223,566.“Incumbent Advantage , ” http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/incumbs.php?cycle=2014 ( May 15 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 This is one of the many reasons incumbents win a large majority of congressional races each electoral cycle .	0	government

 6609 . The Speaker also rules on House procedures , often delegating authority for certain duties to other members .	0	government
 He or she appoints members and chairs to committees , creates select committees to fulfill a specific purpose and then disband , and can even select a member to be speaker pro tempore , who acts as Speaker in the Speaker ’s absence .	0	government
 Finally , when the Senate joins the House in a joint session , the Speaker presides over these sessions , because they are usually held in the House of Representatives .	0	government

 6618 . Technically , bills that raise revenue , like tax bills , must begin in the House .	0	government
 This exception is encoded within the Constitution in Article I , Section 7 , which states , “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . ” Yet , despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution , Congress has found ways to get around this rule .	0	government
 6621 . This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster .	0	government
 The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate .	0	government
 6624 . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government
 6627 . According to political scientist Barbara Sinclair , the primary trigger for the shift away from the classic legislative route was the budget reforms of the 1970s .	0	government

 In the wake of the Civil War , President Andrew Johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during Reconstruction .	0	government
 President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover - up of key information relating to the 1972 break - in at the Democratic Party ’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex .	0	government
 6663 . No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office , starting with George Washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers .	0	government

 Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States .	0	government
 This move changed the way vetoes would be used in the future .	0	government

 The more general defense of its use by White House officials and attorneys ensures that the president can secure candid advice from his or her advisors and staff members . Increasingly over time , presidents have made more use of their unilateral powers , including executive orders , rules that bypass Congress but still have the force of law if the courts do not overturn them .	0	government
 More recently , presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements ( discussed later in this chapter ) directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation .	0	government
 6681 . However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 The act gave the president first - mover advantage in the budget process via the first “ executive budget . ” It also created the first - ever budget staff at the disposal of a president , at the time called the Bureau of the Budget but decades later renamed the Office of Management and Budget ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 6684 . In somewhat of a countervailing trend in the general election stage of the process , by the presidential election of 1824 , many states were using popular elections to choose their electors .	0	government
 This became important in that election when Andrew Jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of electors , but the presidency was given to John Quincy Adams instead .	0	government
 Out of the frustration of Jackson ’s supporters emerged a powerful two - party system that took control of the selection process . Daniel Myron Greene .	0	government

 A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen .	1	biology
 1834 . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected .	0	biology
 When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’s surface .	0	biology
 PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells .	1	biology
 1840 . The first cytokines to be produced are pro - inflammatory ; that is , they encourage inflammation , the localized redness , swelling , heat , and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection . The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen .	1	biology

 A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens .	1	biology
 A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1846 . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .	1	biology
 T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .	0	biology

 1852 . An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins , called a complement system , functions to destroy extracellular pathogens .	1	biology
 Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously ; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms .	0	biology
 1855 . In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized .	0	biology
 There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell - mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies .	0	biology
 Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen .	0	biology
 1858 . Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells .	0	biology
 Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines .	1	biology
 Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen - presenting cell .	0	biology
 1861 . Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .	0	biology
 In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .	0	biology
 The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) .	0	biology
 1864 . Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells : they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts , and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells .	1	biology
 1867 . Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .	0	biology
 Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors .	1	biology
 The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .	0	biology
 1870 . The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) .	1	biology
 Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes .	1	biology
 Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems , which are separated by interstitial space , by a process called extravasation ( passing through to surrounding tissue ) .	0	biology
 1873 . Not all antibodies bind with the same strength , specificity , and stability .	0	biology
 In fact , antibodies exhibit different affinities ( attraction ) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably , and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen .	0	biology
 1876 . Once the afferent arterioles are constricted , blood flow into the nephrons stops .	0	biology
 These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system .	0	biology
 1879 . Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .	1	biology
 Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels .	0	biology
 1882 . The atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator .	1	biology
 It is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea .	0	biology
 1885 . The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody - mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy .	1	biology
 In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens .	0	biology
 1888 . Both methods have advantages and disadvantages .	0	biology
 Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent .	1	biology
 A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly .	0	biology
 1891 . BuddingBudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals .	1	biology
 Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras .	0	biology
 1894 . Hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts .	1	biology
 Invertebrates such as earthworms , slugs , tapeworms and snails , shown in [ link ] , are often hermaphroditic .	0	biology
 1897 . In ovoviparity , fertilized eggs are retained in the female , but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg ’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched .	1	biology
 This occurs in some bony fish ( like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus ) , some sharks , some lizards , some snakes ( such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis ) , some vipers , and some invertebrate animals ( like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa ) .	0	biology
 1900 . Vertebrates have similar structures , with a few differences .	0	biology
 Non - mammals , such as birds and reptiles , have a common body opening , called a cloaca , for the digestive , excretory and reproductive systems .	1	biology
 Coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm .	0	biology
 1903 . Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells , with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen .	0	biology

 The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ .	0	biology
 1909 . The mons pubis is a round , fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis .	1	biology
 The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .	1	biology
 The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .	1	biology
 1912 . Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries , oviducts , the uterus , and the vagina , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments .	0	biology
 1915 . Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells .	1	biology
 The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis .	1	biology
 1918 . At the onset of puberty , the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time .	0	biology
 FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood .	0	biology
 1924 . The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs , while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining .	1	biology
 These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle , with an average length of 28 days .	0	biology
 1927 . To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes , only one sperm must fuse with one egg .	0	biology
 In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 1930 . Cleavage can take place in two ways : holoblastic ( total ) cleavage or meroblastic ( partial ) cleavage .	0	biology
 The type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs .	0	biology
 1936 . During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester , nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion .	0	biology
 As the trimester progresses , the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium , and the placenta forms .	0	biology
 This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus , with the mother ’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it .	1	biology
 1939 . Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise , during further development , to the different organs in the animal body .	1	biology
 This process is called organogenesis .	0	biology
 Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo .	0	biology
 1942 . Ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment .	1	biology
 One core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment .	0	biology
 1945 . Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal , population , and community ecology .	0	biology
 The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components ( living things ) in an area along with the abiotic components ( non - living things ) of that area .	1	biology
 Some of the abiotic components include air , water , and soil .	0	biology
 1954 . Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage .	0	biology
 A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy — the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves .	1	biology
 Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy .	0	biology
 1957 . All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .	1	biology
 The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 1960 . The intertidal zone , which is the zone between high and low tide , is the oceanic region that is closest to land ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Generally , most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach .	0	biology
 1963 . Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .	1	biology
 Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents .	0	biology
 1966 . Watch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) video to see marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms . It is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs .	0	biology
 These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral .	1	biology
 In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores .	0	biology
 1969 . Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water , crop irrigation , sanitation , and industry .	1	biology
 These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services .	0	biology
 Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are , therefore , connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes .	0	biology
 1972 . The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .	0	biology
 The channel ( the width of the river or stream ) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream .	1	biology
 Because of this , the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream .	0	biology
 1975 . Climate refers to the long - term , predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area .	1	biology
 The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges .	0	biology
 1978 . The variation in the sun ’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change .	0	biology
 Solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time .	1	biology
 There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature .	0	biology
 1987 . For mobile organisms , such as mammals , birds , or fish , a technique called mark and recapture is often used .	0	biology
 This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way ( such as tags , bands , paint , or other body markings ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( recaptures ) and some individuals that are unmarked ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1990 . Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time ( usually with data compiled from a life table ) .	1	biology
 These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1993 . After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .	0	biology
 When the population size , N , is plotted over time , a J - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link]).The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited .	0	biology
 Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 1996 . Obviously , a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human .	0	biology
 The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential , or rmax , thus changing the equation to :	0	biology
 2005 . While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration , other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten , even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals .	0	biology
 In Batesian mimicry , a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one .	1	biology
 Assuming they share the same predators , this coloration then protects the harmless ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic .	0	biology
 2008 . All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem , which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community .	1	biology
 The competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat .	1	biology
 In other words , different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources .	0	biology
 2011 . A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism , where two species benefit from their interaction .	1	biology
 Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis .	0	biology
 2020 . Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time .	1	biology
 In primary succession , newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things ; in secondary succession , part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain .	1	biology
 2023 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 2026 . One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning .	1	biology
 Innate behavior , or instinct , is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned .	0	biology
 2029 . A similar , but more directed version of kinesis is taxis : the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus .	1	biology
 This movement can be in response to light ( phototaxis ) , chemical signals ( chemotaxis ) , or gravity ( geotaxis ) and can be directed toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus .	0	biology
 2032 . Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources .	1	biology
 Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors , and these are favored by natural section .	1	biology
 2038 . Significant energy is spent in the process of locating , attracting , and mating with the sex partner .	0	biology
 Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics : intersexual selection , the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex , and intrasexual selection , the competition for mates between species members of the same sex .	1	biology
 Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual , aural , tactile , and chemical cues .	0	biology
 2041 . In polyandrous mating systems , one female mates with many males .	1	biology
 These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems .	0	biology
 2044 . Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning , where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence .	1	biology
 During operant conditioning , the behavioral response is modified by its consequences , with regards to its form , strength , or frequency .	1	biology
 2047 . Some primates , including humans , are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions .	0	biology
 The development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning , the manipulation of information using the mind , the most prominent method of human learning .	1	biology
 In fact , that is how students are learning right now by reading this book .	0	biology
 2050 . Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population .	1	biology
 In other words , fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring .	0	biology
 2053 . Additionally , populations do not usually exist in isolation .	0	biology
 They engage in interspecific competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources .	1	biology
 These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow .	0	biology
 2056 . In contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r designation ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments .	0	biology
 2062 . The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage .	0	biology
 In ecology , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 2068 . Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .	1	biology
 In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in [ link ] , the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain .	0	biology
 2071 . A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .	1	biology
 A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .	1	biology
 These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms .	0	biology
 2077 . An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 Ideally , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers ( such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health .	0	biology
 2086 . One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification .	0	biology
 Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent , toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level , from the primary producers to the apex consumers .	1	biology
 Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate , including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , which was published in the 1960s bestseller , Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson .	0	biology
 2095 . As rain falls through this gas , it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain .	0	biology
 Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas , turning it into weak sulfuric acid , which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems .	1	biology
 Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes , which kills many of the resident fauna ; it also affects the man - made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings .	0	biology
 2098 . The Nile perch was introduced in 1963 , but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge .	0	biology
 The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the disappearance of a species ) .	0	biology
 In fact , there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria : the Nile perch , declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria , and increased fishing pressure .	0	biology
 2101 . It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems .	0	biology
 2104 . In 1988 , British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss : biodiversity hotspots .	0	biology
 Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species .	1	biology
 The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation triage .	0	biology
 2107 . A second approach to estimating present - time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest - area loss and understanding species - area relationships .	0	biology
 The species - area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased .	1	biology
 Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases .	0	biology

 6739 . Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt offered models of vigorous executive leadership , while the image and style of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan influenced and at times haunted or frustrated successors .	0	government
 Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies . The youth and glamour that John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline brought to the White House in the early 1960s ( a ) helped give rise to the legend of “ one brief shining moment that was Camelot ” after Kennedy ’s presidency was cut short by his assassination on November 22 , 1963 .	0	government
