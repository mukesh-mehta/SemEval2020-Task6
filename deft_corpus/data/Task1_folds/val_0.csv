 3246 . The pion must then be captured and , thus , can not be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent violation of mass - energy conservation .	0	physics
 Such particles ( like the pion above ) are called virtual particles , because they can not be directly observed but their effects can be directly observed .	1	physics
 Realizing all this , Yukawa used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion , the particle that carries it .	0	physics
 3249 . He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S. I. Tomonaga for work in QED with its deep implications for particle physics . Why is it that particles called gluons are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when , in The Yukawa Particle and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited , we saw that pions apparently carry that force ?	0	physics
 The answer is that pions are exchanged but they have a substructure and , as we explore it , we find that the strong force is actually related to the indirectly observed but more fundamental gluons .	0	physics
 In fact , all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no substructure .	0	physics
 3255 . Quarks have been mentioned at various points in this text as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive club of truly elementary particles .	0	physics
 Note that an elementary or fundamental particle has no substructure ( it is not made of other particles ) and has no finite size other than its wavelength .	1	physics
 This does not mean that fundamental particles are stable — some decay , while others do not .	0	physics
 3258 . Originally , three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then - known mesons and baryons .	0	physics
 These quark flavors are named up ( u ) , down ( d ) , and strange ( s ) .	0	physics
 All quarks have half - integral spin and are thus fermions .	0	physics
 3264 . The analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good — the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances , but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale , and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable .	0	physics
 The search for a correct theory linking the forces , called the Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) , is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics .	0	physics
 Frontiers of Physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology , on the opposite end of the distance scale .	0	physics
 [ link ] is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } , similar to the diagrams in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces .	0	physics
 3267 . It is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles , but the theory ( quantum chromodynamics or QCD ) is very self - consistent .	0	physics
 So successful have QCD and the electroweak theory been that , taken together , they are called the Standard Model .	0	physics
 Advances in knowledge are expected to modify , but not overthrow , the Standard Model of particle physics and forces .	0	physics
 3270 . And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics .	0	physics

 The detection of what is now called the cosmic microwave background ( CMBR ) was so important ( generally considered as important as Hubble ’s detection that the galactic red shift is proportional to distance ) that virtually every scientist has accepted the expansion of the universe as fact .	0	physics
 Penzias and Wilson shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery .	0	physics
 3279 . By 1916 , he had laid the foundation of general relativity , again almost on his own .	0	physics
 Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations — doing this is to perform a thought experiment .	1	physics
 [ link ] illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field .	0	physics
 3285 . Gravitational wavesIf a massive object distorts the space around it , like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond , then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond .	0	physics
 Gravitational waves are mass - created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity .	1	physics
 Since gravity is by far the weakest force , extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves .	0	physics
 3288 . This , until recently , was a question of whether there is enough gravitation to stop the expansion of the universe .	0	physics
 In the past few years , it has become a question of the combination of gravitation and what is called the cosmological constant .	0	physics
 The cosmological constant was invented by Einstein to prohibit the expansion or contraction of the universe .	0	physics
 At the time he developed general relativity , Einstein considered that an illogical possibility .	0	physics
 3291 . This means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , analogous to circumnavigating the Earth .	0	physics
 In between these two is a flat ( zero curvature ) universe .	0	physics
 The recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat , and will expand forever .	0	physics
 3297 . The simple laws of physics apply , of course , but complex systems may reveal patterns that simple systems do not .	0	physics
 The emerging field of complexity is devoted to the study of complex systems , including those outside the traditional bounds of physics .	1	physics
 Of particular interest is the ability of complex systems to adapt and evolve .	0	physics

 The high - pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower - pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer .	0	physics
 3303 . Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes .	0	physics
 A bow wake , such as the one in [ link ] , is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed .	1	physics
 Water waves spread out in circles from the point where created , and the bow wake is the familiar V - shaped wake trailing the source .	0	physics
 3306 . Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles , but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus .	0	physics
 Another , equally famous , early accelerator is the cyclotron , invented in 1930 by the American physicist , E. O. Lawrence ( 1901–1958 ) .	0	physics

 4319 . In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .	1	economic
 Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .	0	economic
 For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average .	0	economic
 4322 . For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 Fiscal policy , which involves government spending and taxes , is determined by a nation ’s legislative body .	1	economic
 For the United States , this is the Congress and the executive branch , which originates the federal budget .	0	economic
 4325 . Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory .	0	economic
 Strictly speaking , a theory is a more abstract representation , while a model is more applied or empirical representation .	0	economic
 4328 . There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy .	0	economic
 The first is the traditional economy , which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia , Africa , and South America .	0	economic
 Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done ( i.e. , tradition ) .	1	economic
 4331 . The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .	0	economic
 In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .	0	economic
 Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .	1	economic
 4334 . The Rise of GlobalizationRecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization , which is the expanding cultural , political , and economic connections between people around the world .	1	economic
 One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods , services , and assets across national borders — in other words , international trade and financial capital flows .	0	economic
 4337 . Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .	1	economic
 Thus , the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country ’s total economic production is sold in other countries .	0	economic
 4340 . In many cases , it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price .	0	economic
 If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $ 300 , then $ 300 measures the amount of “ other consumption ” that he has given up .	0	economic
 4343 . The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern .	1	economic
 Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility , which means that as a person receives more of a good , the additional ( or marginal ) utility from each additional unit of the good declines .	0	economic
 In other words , the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth . The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all - or - nothing choices .	0	economic
 4346 . The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up .	0	economic
 Just as with Alphonso ’s budget constraint , the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier .	0	economic
 By now you might be saying , “ Hey , this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint . ” If so , read the following Clear It Up feature .	0	economic
 4349 . In everyday usage , efficiency refers to lack of waste .	0	economic
 An inefficient machine operates at high cost , while an efficient machine operates at lower cost , because it is not wasting energy or materials .	1	economic
 An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs , while an efficient organization meets schedules , is focused , and performs within budget .	1	economic
 4352 . For government , this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm .	0	economic
 At the individual and firm level , the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity , quality , and price that people want .	0	economic
 But for both the government and the market economy in the short term , increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy .	0	economic
 4355 . Fortunately however , the assumption that individuals are purely self - interested is a simplification about human nature .	0	economic
 In fact , we need to look no further than to Adam Smith , the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this .	0	economic
 The opening sentence of his book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , puts it very clearly : “ How selfish soever man may be supposed , there are evidently some principles in his nature , which interest him in the fortune of others , and render their happiness necessary to him , though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it . ” Clearly , individuals are both self - interested and altruistic .	0	economic
 4358 . The third theme is economic efficiency , or getting the most benefit from scarce resources .	1	economic
 All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases , there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other .	0	economic
 4361 . To find answers to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity .	0	economic
 Elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable .	1	economic
 Suppose you drop two items from a second - floor balcony .	0	economic
 4364 . The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 4367 . Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	0	economic
 Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4370 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .	1	economic
 In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4373 . Constant unitary elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity .	0	economic
 4376 . Income Elasticity of DemandThe income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income . Income elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeIncome elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeFor most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods .	0	economic
 However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .	0	economic
 4379 . Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital MarketsThe concept of elasticity applies to any market , not just markets for goods and services .	0	economic
 In the labor market , for example , the wage elasticity of labor supply — that is , the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages — will determine the shape of the labor supply curve .	0	economic
 Specifically :	0	economic
 4382 . If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .	0	economic
 This activity of production goes beyond manufacturing ( i.e. , making things ) .	0	economic
 It includes any process or service that creates value , including transportation , distribution , wholesale and retail sales .	0	economic
 4385 . Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .	0	economic
 Implicit costs are more subtle , but just as important .	0	economic
 They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm .	1	economic
 4388 . The cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses .	0	economic
 A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast - food meals .	0	economic
 4391 . Variable costs , on the other hand , are incurred in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost .	1	economic
 Labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours .	0	economic
 4394 . But as output expands still further , the average cost begins to rise .	0	economic
 At the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in . Average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output .	0	economic
 For example , the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $ 400 , so the average variable cost is $ 400/80 , or $ 5 per haircut .	0	economic
 4397 . Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market .	0	economic
 If we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit , also known as the firm ’s profit margin .	1	economic
 Expanding the equation for profit gives :	0	economic
 4400 . While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve .	0	economic
 Thus , the long - run average cost ( LRAC ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( SRAC ) curves , each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs .	0	economic
 More precisely , the long - run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output .	1	economic
 4403 . Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm , not just a large factory .	0	economic
 The leviathan effect can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently , across the entirety of the enterprise .	0	economic
 Firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region , thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level .

 4406 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .	1	economic
 The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service .	0	economic
 4409 . The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period ( for example , per day or per year ) and over some geographic area ( like a state or a country ) .	0	economic
 A demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [ link ] , with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 ( Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable ( x ) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable ( y ) goes on the vertical .	0	economic
 4412 . Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .	0	economic
 4415 . Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .	0	economic
 A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price , shown on the vertical axis , and quantity , shown on the horizontal axis .	1	economic
 The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information .	0	economic
 4418 . The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .	1	economic
 At any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price .	0	economic
 4421 . The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 The result was the demand curve and the supply curve .	0	economic
 4424 . For some — luxury cars , vacations in Europe , and fine jewelry — the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced .	0	economic
 A product whose demand rises when income rises , and vice versa , is called a normal good .	1	economic
 A few exceptions to this pattern do exist .	0	economic
 4427 . The demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements .	0	economic
 A substitute is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service .	1	economic
 As electronic books , like this one , become more available , you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books .	0	economic
 4430 . If other factors relevant to supply do change , then the entire supply curve will shift .	0	economic
 Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price , a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price .	0	economic
 4433 . According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press , more and more people , especially younger people , are getting their news from online and digital sources .	0	economic
 The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets , and most of those Americans say they use them in part to get the news .	0	economic
 4436 . Laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls .	1	economic
 Price controls come in two flavors .	0	economic
 4439 . Markets for labor have demand and supply curves , just like markets for goods .	0	economic
 The law of demand applies in labor markets this way : A higher salary or wage — that is , a higher price in the labor market — leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers , while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded .	0	economic
 The law of supply functions in labor markets , too : A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied ; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied . Equilibrium in the Labor Market	0	economic
 4442 . The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate , under the ceteris paribus assumption .	1	economic
 A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor .	0	economic
 4445 . Some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit .	0	economic
 Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses . In this section , we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital ( i.e. , savings ) with those who demand financial capital ( i.e. , borrowing ) .	0	economic
 Those who save money ( or make financial investments , which is the same thing ) , whether individuals or businesses , are on the supply side of the financial market .	0	economic
 4448 . Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods : now or in the future .	1	economic
 Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time .	0	economic
 Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store , decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time , sometimes a long period .	0	economic
 4451 . A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets .	0	economic
 The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive .	0	economic
 Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices .	1	economic
 4454 . If José had unlimited income or goods were free , then he could consume without limit .	0	economic
 But José , like all of us , faces a budget constraint .	0	economic
 José has a total of $ 56 to spend .	0	economic
 4457 . The fourth T - shirt is just to something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils .	0	economic
 This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility , which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added .	1	economic
 4460 . The general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities .	0	economic
 When the price of good 1 is divided by the price of good 2 , at the utility - maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2 .	1	economic
 This rule , known as the consumer equilibrium , can be written in algebraic form :	0	economic
 4463 . Conversely , when income falls , the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods .	0	economic
 As defined in the chapter on Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity , goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed . However , depending on Kimberly ’s preferences , a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines .	1	economic
 A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .	0	economic
 4466 . The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .	1	economic
 The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .	1	economic
 In this example , the higher price for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy a fewer bats for both reasons .	0	economic
 4469 . The middle , close - to - vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor .	0	economic
 The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward - bending supply curve for labor , which is the situation of high - wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still - higher wage by working fewer hours .	1	economic

 For example , he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point A , with consumption of $ 1 million in the present , zero savings , and zero future consumption ; point B , with present consumption of $ 800,000 , savings of $ 200,000 , and future consumption of $ 1,148,000 ; point C , with present consumption of $ 600,000 , savings of $ 400,000 , and future consumption of $ 2,296,000 ; or even choice D , with present consumption of zero , savings of $ 1,000,000 , and future consumption of $ 5,740,000 .	0	economic
 4475 . We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain .	1	economic
 This is known as loss aversion , where a $ 1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $ 1 gain helps us , according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journal Econometrica .	0	economic
 This insight has implications for investing , as people tend to “ overplay ” the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains .	0	economic
 4478 . Firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur : ( 1 ) many firms produce identical products ; ( 2 ) many buyers are available to buy the product , and many sellers are available to sell the product ; ( 3 ) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold ; and ( 4 ) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions — in other words , there is free entry and exit into and out of the market .	1	economic
 4481 . Total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm , broken down into fixed and variable costs , are shown in [ link ] and also appear in [ link ] .	0	economic
 The horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs ; the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs , measured in dollars .	0	economic
 4484 . New firms may start production , as well .	0	economic
 When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry . Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee .	1	economic
 If a business is making losses in the short run , it will either keep limping along or just shut down , depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs .	0	economic
 4487 . Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit . To understand how short - run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run , imagine the following situation .	0	economic
 The market is in long - run equilibrium , where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC .	0	economic
 No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market .	0	economic
 4490 . For a decreasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience lower costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a lower price than before .	1	economic
 In this case , the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs .	0	economic
 4493 . In this chapter , we explore the opposite extreme : monopoly . If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price , monopoly is a market with no competition at all , and firms have complete market power .	0	economic
 In the case of monopoly , one firm produces all of the output in a market .	1	economic
 Since a monopoly faces no significant competition , it can charge any price it wishes .	0	economic
 4496 . One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .	1	economic
 The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .	1	economic
 4499 . A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good , like Chiquita bananas , Chevrolet cars , or the Nike “ swoosh ” that appears on shoes and athletic gear .	1	economic
 Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S. government .	0	economic
 4502 . Taken together , this combination of patents , trademarks , copyrights , and trade secret law is called intellectual property , because it implies ownership over an idea , concept , or image , not a physical piece of property like a house or a car .	1	economic
 Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property , although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries .	0	economic
 4505 . Profits for the monopolist , like any firm , will be equal to total revenues minus total costs .	0	economic
 The pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm — that is , by using total cost , fixed cost , variable cost , marginal cost , average cost , and average variable cost .	0	economic
 However , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm .	0	economic
 4508 . [ link ] repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from [ link ] , and adds two more columns : Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold .	1	economic
 It is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost .	0	economic
 4511 . What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes , firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive ?	0	economic
 What determines their behavior ?	0	economic
 4514 . Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are distinctive in some way .	1	economic
 Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing ; restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food ; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names .	0	economic
 4517 . A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition .	1	economic
 [ link ] offers a reminder that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat , because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price .	0	economic
 In contrast , the demand curve , as faced by a monopolist , is the market demand curve , since a monopolist is the only firm in the market , and hence is downward sloping .	0	economic
 4520 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .	0	economic
 The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .	0	economic
 4523 . The long - term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve .	0	economic
 This outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost .	0	economic
 However , in monopolistic competition , the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve , not at the very bottom of the AC curve .	0	economic
 4526 . Similarly , a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .	0	economic
 In such a setting , the market has room for only one firm , because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete , and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market .	0	economic
 4529 . When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .	1	economic
 A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .	1	economic
 See the following Clear It Up feature for a more in - depth analysis of the difference between the two .	0	economic
 4532 . Because of the complexity of oligopoly , which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how oligopolies behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures .	1	economic
 Instead , economists use game theory , a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do .	1	economic
 Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences , as well as in business , law , and military strategy .	0	economic
 4535 . The result of this prisoner ’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist , the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $ 400 each in profits .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular .	0	economic
 4538 . If one firm cuts its price to $ 300 , it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats .	0	economic
 However , if the airline seeks to raise prices , the other oligopolists will not raise their prices , and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales .	0	economic
 4541 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .	1	economic
 When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .	1	economic
 An acquisition may not look just like a merger , since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name .	0	economic
 4544 . In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .	0	economic
 In 1914 , the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions ( where the outcome would be to “ substantially lessen competition ” in an industry ) , price discrimination ( where different customers are charged different prices for the same product ) , and tied sales ( where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product ) .	1	economic
 Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .	0	economic
 4547 . An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .	1	economic
 For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .	0	economic
 The four - firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms : in this case , 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40 .	0	economic
 4550 . However , in the total market for all computer software and services , including everything from games to scientific programs , the Microsoft share was only about 14 % in 2014 .	0	economic
 A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization .	1	economic
 In addition , these two shifts are interconnected .	0	economic
 4553 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .	1	economic
 Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .	1	economic
 A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers .	0	economic
 4556 . Even if a customer was interested in a portable TV , the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market .	0	economic
 A related , but not identical , concept is called bundling , where two or more products are sold as one .	1	economic
 Bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price .	0	economic
 4559 . A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly .	0	economic
 A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand .	1	economic
 This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs .	0	economic
 4562 . They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers accordingly .	1	economic
 This method was known as cost - plus regulation .	0	economic
 4565 . One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow .	1	economic
 When the airline industry was being regulated , for example , it suggested appointees to the regulatory board , sent lobbyists to argue with the board , provided most of the information on which the board made decisions , and offered well - paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board .	0	economic
 4568 . Private markets , such as the cell phone industry , offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced , how they are produced , and who gets them .	0	economic
 The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking .	0	economic
 4571 . Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	1	economic
 If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	0	economic
 If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .	0	economic
 4574 . In a market with no anti - pollution restrictions , firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free .	0	economic
 Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .	0	economic
 If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .	0	economic
 4577 . Other laws required the installation of certain equipment — for example , on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks — to reduce pollution .	0	economic
 These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation .	0	economic
 In effect , command - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account . Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment .	1	economic
 4580 . A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits .	1	economic
 A pollution charge gives a profit - maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax .	0	economic
 4583 . Another application of marketable permits occurred when the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 .	0	economic
 The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain , which harms forests as well as buildings .	0	economic
 4586 . The definition of ecotourism is a little vague .	1	economic
 Does it mean sleeping on the ground , eating roots , and getting close to wild animals ?	0	economic
 4589 . No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming — not without the cooperation of other nations .	0	economic
 Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material .	1	economic
 Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .	0	economic
 4592 . The tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) such as the one shown in [ link ] .	1	economic
 At one extreme , at a choice like P , a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection .	0	economic
 4595 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .	1	economic
 Revisit Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms .	0	economic
 4598 . Will private firms in a market economy under invest in research and technology ?	0	economic
 If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .	0	economic
 4601 . The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	1	economic
 Economists and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return .	0	economic
 4604 . After all , if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education , society should expect some kind of return on that spending .	0	economic
 Again , economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that , across a variety of nations , the social rate of return on schooling is also positive .	0	economic
 After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .	0	economic
 4607 . Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .	1	economic
 For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .	0	economic
 Without a patent , the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products , and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit .	0	economic
 4610 . Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .	0	economic
 The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .	1	economic
 Cooperation between government - funded universities , academies , and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries .	0	economic
 1216 . Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .	0	biology
 A horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers .	1	biology
 Five factors account for soil formation : parent material , climate , topography , biological factors , and time . Parent Material	0	biology
 1219 . Animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices , and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation .	0	biology
 Plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root , in an area known as the rhizosphere .	1	biology
 Additionally , leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition .	0	biology
 1222 . In this area , rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface .	0	biology
 The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward , resulting in a dense layer in the soil .	1	biology
 In some soils , the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate .	0	biology
 1225 . Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .	1	biology
 This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase .	0	biology
 Therefore , using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants , as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource , such as natural gas .	0	biology
 1228 . A symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship , with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation .	1	biology
 Fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae ( called lichens ) .	1	biology
 1231 . Plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle : the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage .	0	biology
 The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .	1	biology
 Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .	1	biology
 1234 . The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium .	0	biology
 The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .	1	biology
 The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .	1	biology
 1237 . Each pollen grain has two coverings : the exine ( thicker , outer layer ) and the intine ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The exine contains sporopollenin , a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells .	1	biology
 1240 . During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac . Two of the nuclei — the polar nuclei — move to the equator and fuse , forming a single , diploid central cell .	1	biology
 This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .	0	biology
 1243 . The ovule wall will become part of the fruit .	0	biology
 The integuments , while protecting the megasporangium , do not enclose it completely , but leave an opening called the micropyle .	0	biology
 The micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization .	1	biology
 1246 . In angiosperms , pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower .	1	biology
 In gymnosperms , pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone .	1	biology
 1249 . They visit flowers that are open during the day , are brightly colored , have a strong aroma or scent , and have a tubular shape , typically with the presence of a nectar guide .	0	biology
 A nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees , and not to humans ; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower , thus making the pollination process more efficient .	1	biology
 The pollen sticks to the bees’ fuzzy hair , and when the bee visits another flower , some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower .	0	biology
 1252 . After fertilization , the zygote divides to form two cells : the upper cell , or terminal cell , and the lower , or basal , cell .	0	biology
 The division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor , which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue .	0	biology
 The suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo .	1	biology
 1255 . Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .	0	biology
 Upon germination , enzymes are secreted by the aleurone , a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo .	1	biology
 The enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates , proteins and lipids , the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo .	0	biology
 1258 . The seed , along with the ovule , is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac .	0	biology
 In dicots , the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen .	1	biology
 1261 . In monocots , the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation .	0	biology
 The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .	1	biology
 The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .	1	biology
 1267 . In many seeds , the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate .	0	biology
 Scarification , which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat , is often employed before germination .	1	biology
 Presoaking in hot water , or passing through an acid environment , such as an animal ’s digestive tract , may also be employed .	0	biology
 1270 . An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .	1	biology
 An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .	0	biology
 1273 . Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .	1	biology
 Together , all three are known as the pericarp .	0	biology
 The mesocarp is usually the fleshy , edible part of the fruit ; however , in some fruits , such as the almond , the endocarp is the edible part .	0	biology
 1276 . In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .	1	biology
 The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .	1	biology
 Both are cut at an oblique angle ( any angle other than a right angle ) , placed in close contact with each other , and are then held together [ link ] .	1	biology
 1279 . Micropropagation ( also called plant tissue culture ) is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions [ link ] .	1	biology
 This method allows propagation of rare , endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions , are economically important , or are in demand as disease - free plants .	0	biology
 1282 . The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence , which is marked by several complex biochemical changes .	1	biology
 One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts , which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves .	0	biology
 1285 . This is fused to the animal ’s epidermis .	0	biology
 Ingrowths of the exoskeleton , called apodemes , function as attachment sites for muscles , similar to tendons in more advanced animals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In order to grow , the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering .	0	biology
 1288 . Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal / g , and fat contains about 9 kcal / g .	0	biology
 Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate ( SMR ) in ectotherms .	1	biology
 Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal / day , and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal / day .	0	biology
 1291 . Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .	0	biology
 During hibernation , ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) , while a bear ’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 ° C ( 99 ° F).If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water , it is called estivation .	1	biology
 Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year .	0	biology
 1294 . A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .	1	biology
 1297 . The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral ( or spinal ) cavities .	1	biology
 The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity , which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity , which surrounds the heart .	1	biology
 The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity , which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities .	0	biology
 1300 . Squamous epithelial cells are generally round , flat , and have a small , centrally located nucleus .	0	biology
 The cell outline is slightly irregular , and cells fit together to form a covering or lining .	0	biology
 1303 . The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells , making it appear as though there is more than one layer , as seen in [ link ] .	1	biology
 This is called pseudostratified , columnar epithelia .	0	biology
 This cellular covering has cilia at the apical , or free , surface of the cells .	1	biology
 1306 . Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others .	0	biology
 The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density .	0	biology
 When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers , it has proportionally a less dense matrix .	0	biology
 1309 . Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .	1	biology
 The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 1312 . Compact bone is found in the shaft ( or diaphysis ) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones , while spongy bone is found in the end ( or epiphysis ) of a long bone .	1	biology
 Compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .	1	biology
 1315 . These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures .	0	biology
 Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body .	1	biology
 It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body ’s systems encounter .	0	biology
 1318 . Positive Feedback LoopA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus , possibly accelerating it .	1	biology
 Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies , but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting , or coagulation .	1	biology
 1324 . Omnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal - derived food .	1	biology
 In Latin , omnivore means to eat everything .	0	biology
 1327 . As the word monogastric suggests , this type of digestive system consists of one ( “ mono ” ) stomach chamber ( “ gastric ” ) .	1	biology
 Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in [ link]ab .	0	biology
 1330 . Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes , which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria .	0	biology
 Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .	1	biology
 Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .	0	biology
 1333 . The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach .	1	biology
 The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .	0	biology
 1345 . The large intestine , illustrated in [ link ] , reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material .	1	biology
 The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter .	0	biology
 1348 . The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood .	1	biology
 The liver produces bile , a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum .	1	biology
 1351 . Essential NutrientsWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors , there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food .	1	biology
 These nutrients are termed essential nutrients , meaning they must be eaten , and the body can not produce them .	0	biology
 1354 . Food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules .	0	biology
 The first step in this process is ingestion .	0	biology
 Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth .	1	biology
 1357 . The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides , which are short chains of four to nine amino acids .	1	biology
 In the duodenum , other enzymes — trypsin , elastase , and chymotrypsin — act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides .	0	biology
 Trypsin elastase , carboxypeptidase , and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme .	0	biology
 1360 . The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth .	0	biology
 The first phase of ingestion , called the cephalic phase , is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food .	1	biology
 All aspects — such as sight , sense , and smell — trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices .	0	biology
 1363 . The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times .	1	biology
 1366 . In the duodenum , digestive secretions from the liver , pancreas , and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase .	0	biology
 In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .	1	biology
 Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .	0	biology
 1369 . The nervous system is made up of neurons , specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals , and glia , cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons .	1	biology
 A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire — it transmits a signal from one place to another .	0	biology
 1372 . The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .	1	biology
 An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .	1	biology
 These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons , muscle , or target organs .	0	biology
 1375 . There are several different types of glia with different functions , two of which are shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Astrocytes , shown in [ link]a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS .	1	biology
 They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons , regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid , and provide structural support for synapses .	0	biology
 1378 . Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .	1	biology
 One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .	0	biology
 1381 . Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	0	biology
 Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .	1	biology
 They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid , which serves as a cushion for the brain , moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain , and is a component for the choroid plexus . Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment .	0	biology
 1384 . When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .	0	biology
 At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron .	0	biology
 A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( -55 mV ) .	0	biology
 1387 . Flow of ions through these channels , particularly the Na+ channels , regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon .	1	biology
 This ‘ jumping’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction .	0	biology
 If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon , the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points .	0	biology
 1390 . Na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize .	1	biology
 This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .	0	biology
 Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .	1	biology
 1393 . Long - term potentiation ( LTP ) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection .	1	biology
 LTP is based on the Hebbian principle : cells that fire together wire together .	0	biology
 1396 . The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .	1	biology
 The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .	0	biology
 As the Latin suggests , the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord .	1	biology
 1399 . The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .	0	biology
 1402 . The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .	0	biology
 A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum ( Latin : “ tough body ” ) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other .	1	biology
 Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other , the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant .	0	biology
 1405 . Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .	0	biology
 Two of the parietal lobe ’s main functions are processing somatosensation — touch sensations like pressure , pain , heat , cold — and processing proprioception — the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space .	0	biology
 The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex .	0	biology
 1408 . The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .	1	biology
 It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .	1	biology
 The hippocampus is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1411 . Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland , a pea - sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells .	1	biology
 1414 . The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .	0	biology
 The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain .	1	biology
 1417 . Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body .	1	biology
 1420 . Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) .	0	biology
 The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .	0	biology
 1423 . Humans have 12 cranial nerves , nerves that emerge from or enter the skull ( cranium ) , as opposed to the spinal nerves , which emerge from the vertebral column .	1	biology
 Each cranial nerve is accorded a name , which are detailed in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1426 . Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly .	0	biology
 In 2012 , an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer ’s disease , and payments for their care are estimated at $ 200 billion .	0	biology
 1429 . Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD)Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .	0	biology
 Like ASD , ADHD is more prevalent in males than females .	0	biology
 1432 . Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime .	0	biology
 While there are several different types of epilepsy , all are characterized by recurrent seizures .	0	biology
 1435 . This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .	0	biology
 In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .	0	biology
 Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system .	0	biology
 1438 . The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system .	0	biology
 This takes place at the sensory receptor , and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential .	1	biology
 How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?	0	biology
 1441 . Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated ( that is , surrounded by a capsule ) or unencapsulated ( a group that includes free nerve endings ) .	1	biology
 A free nerve ending , as its name implies , is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron .	1	biology
 Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin , and they extend into the middle of the epidermis .	0	biology
 1444 . Deeper in the epidermis , near the base , are Ruffini endings , which are also known as bulbous corpuscles .	0	biology
 They are found in both glabrous and hairy skin .	0	biology
 1447 . Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .	0	biology
 Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs .	0	biology
 1450 . Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz ; cats , 60,000 Hz ; bats , 100,000 Hz ; and dolphins 150,000 Hz , and American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ) , a fish , can hear 180,000 Hz .	0	biology
 Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound . Amplitude , or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough , in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds .	0	biology
 1453 . Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	0	biology
 The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	1	biology
 The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .	0	biology
 1456 . The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .	1	biology
 The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .	1	biology
 Here , the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea .	0	biology
 1459 . When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane , it flexes back and forth in a wave - like fashion .	0	biology
 Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane .	0	biology
 1462 . The fluid - filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles .	0	biology
 They are arranged in three spatial planes .	0	biology
 1465 . The photoreceptive cells of the eye , where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs , are located in the retina ( shown in [ link ] ) on the inner surface of the back of the eye .	1	biology
 But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered .	0	biology
 1468 . The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken , changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina .	0	biology
 With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens , and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results .	0	biology
 Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .	0	biology
 1471 . There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina : rods and cones , named for their general appearance as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina .	1	biology
 1474 . Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity .	0	biology
 That is , they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light .	1	biology
 1477 . Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .	1	biology
 The SCN sends information to the pineal gland , which is important in sleep / wake patterns and annual cycles .	0	biology
 1480 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .	1	biology
 1483 . Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons ( neurons with two processes from the cell body ) .	1	biology
 Each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium , and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor - laden , hair - like cilia that trap odorant molecules .	0	biology
 1486 . These are elongated cells with hair - like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Food molecules ( tastants ) are dissolved in saliva , and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli .	1	biology
 The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue , outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent .	0	biology
 1489 . Chemically , these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols ; their chemical names will end in “ -ol ” for alcohols or “ -one ” for ketones .	0	biology
 Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol , which is an estrogen , or female sex hormone , and testosterone , which is an androgen , or male sex hormone .	1	biology
 These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs , respectively .	0	biology
 1492 . Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors .	0	biology
 In this way , even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types , they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors .	0	biology
 1495 . Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes .	0	biology
 Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone , hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription , or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways .	0	biology
 1498 . One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .	0	biology
 When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor , a G - protein that is associated with the receptor is activated ; G - proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane .	1	biology
 When a hormone is not bound to the receptor , the G - protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate , or GDP .	0	biology
 1501 . The term “ humoral ” is derived from the term “ humor , ” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood .	1	biology
 A humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood .	1	biology
 For example , a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin .	0	biology
 1504 . Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones , the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body 's physiology .	0	biology
 Hypothalamic - Pituitary AxisThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain .	1	biology
 1507 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .	1	biology
 This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .	1	biology
 1510 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .	0	biology
 3319 . A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .	0	psychology
 Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 ( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .	1	psychology
 ( b ) Phenotype describes an individual ’s observable characteristics , such as hair color , skin color , height , and build .	0	psychology
 3322 . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .	1	psychology
 When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele .	1	psychology
 When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous .	1	psychology
 3325 . ( a ) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring .	1	psychology
 The capital B represents the dominant allele , and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele .	0	psychology
 3328 . Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .	1	psychology
 Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .	0	psychology
 If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU , their offspring have a 25 % chance of expressing the PKU phenotype .	0	psychology
 3334 . Visit this site for an engaging video primer on the epigenetics of twin studies .	0	psychology
 3340 . Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system , 100 billion strong at birth .	1	psychology
 Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3343 . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .	1	psychology
 The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .	0	psychology
 The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .	1	psychology
 3346 . Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet .	0	psychology
 In some axons , glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath , which coats the axon and acts as an insulator , increasing the speed at which the signal travels .	1	psychology
 The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function .	0	psychology
 3349 . We begin at the neuronal membrane .	0	psychology
 The neuron exists in a fluid environment — it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid ( i.e. , cytoplasm ) .	1	psychology
 The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .	0	psychology
 3355 . The action potential is an all - or - none phenomenon .	0	psychology
 In simple terms , this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation .	1	psychology
 3358 . There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons , and we can speak in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders .	0	psychology
 3361 . Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system .	1	psychology
 Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .	1	psychology
 An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .	1	psychology
 3364 . The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary .	1	psychology
 It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS ; therefore , it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons .	0	psychology
 3367 . The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .	0	psychology
 Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium , in which biological conditions ( such as body temperature ) are maintained at optimal levels .	1	psychology
 3370 . The Spinal CordIt can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world .	1	psychology
 Because of it , the brain can act .	0	psychology
 3373 . There is evidence of some specialization of function — referred to as lateralization — in each hemisphere , mainly regarding differences in language ability .	1	psychology
 Beyond that , however , the differences that have been found have been minor .	0	psychology
 3376 . Lobes of the BrainThe four lobes of the brain are the frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital lobes ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain , extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus .	1	psychology
 The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .	0	psychology
 3379 . Gage 's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over localization — regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions .	1	psychology
 On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage , the extent of his injury , and his life before and after the accident , scientists tended to find support for their own views , on whichever side of the debate they fell ( Macmillan , 1999 ) .	0	psychology
 ( a ) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction accident .	0	psychology
 ( b ) Gage ’s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere .	0	psychology
 3382 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .	1	psychology
 The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology
 3385 . The occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain , and contains the primary visual cortex , which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information .	1	psychology
 The occipital cortex is organized retinotopically , which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person ’s visual field and the position of that object ’s representation on the cortex .	1	psychology
 3388 . The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory .	1	psychology
 Interestingly , the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system ; therefore , not surprisingly , smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not .	0	psychology
 3391 . The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior .	0	psychology
 3394 . Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep / wake cycle , arousal , alertness , and motor activity .	0	psychology
 3397 . It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .	1	psychology
 The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .	1	psychology
 3400 . On February 25 , 1990 , a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest , apparently triggered by a bulimic episode .	0	psychology
 She was eventually revived , but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time .	0	psychology
 3403 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans create pictures of the living , active brain ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance , called a tracer .	1	psychology
 3406 . In some situations , it is helpful to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person ’s brain , without needing information on the actual location of the activity .	0	psychology
 Electroencephalography ( EEG ) serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain ’s electrical activity .	1	psychology
 An array of electrodes is placed around a person ’s head ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3409 . Located in the neck , the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth , metabolism , and appetite .	1	psychology
 In hyperthyroidism , or Grave ’s disease , the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine , causing agitation , bulging eyes , and weight loss .	1	psychology
 3412 . These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .	0	psychology
 People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . The gonads secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior .	1	psychology
 The female gonads are the ovaries ; the male gonads are the testes .	1	psychology
 3415 . Visit this website to see an example of a consent form . While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing , sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study .	0	psychology
 Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment , but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful .	1	psychology
 For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .	0	psychology
 3418 . Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects .	0	psychology
 Often , these researchers use rodents ( [ link ] ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments — the APA estimates that 90 % of all animal research in psychology uses these species ( American Psychological Association , n.d . ) .	0	psychology
 Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans , these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants .	1	psychology
 3421 . We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient .	0	psychology
 A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to + 1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables .	1	psychology
 The correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter r .	0	psychology
 3424 . Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables .	1	psychology
 However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .	1	psychology
 While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .	0	psychology
 3427 . We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations , especially with unsystematic observations .	0	psychology
 Illusory correlations , or false correlations , occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists .	1	psychology
 One well - known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon ’s phases have on human behavior .	0	psychology
 3430 . In order to conduct an experiment , a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested .	0	psychology
 As you ’ve learned , hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research .	1	psychology
 3433 . Ideally , the people who observe and record the children ’s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group , in order to control for experimenter bias .	0	psychology
 Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher ’s expectations might skew the results of the study .	1	psychology
 Remember , conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning , and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses .	0	psychology
 3436 . Because by doing so , we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations .	0	psychology
 If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration .	0	psychology
 The placebo effect occurs when people 's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation .	1	psychology
 3439 . Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include .	0	psychology
 Participants are the subjects of psychological research , and as the name implies , individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process .	1	psychology
 Often , psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants .	0	psychology
 3442 . Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design .	0	psychology
 With sufficiently large samples , random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups .	1	psychology
 3445 . Poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out , and even well - designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested .	0	psychology
 Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it , meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability .	1	psychology
 Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding .	0	psychology
 3448 . In observational research , scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just a few individuals .	1	psychology
 Indeed , some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals .	0	psychology
 3451 . The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another .	0	psychology
 The anthropologist Jane Goodall , for example , spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation , some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers — using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study ( McKie , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3454 . To protect against this type of bias , researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified .	0	psychology
 In addition , researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers , in order to test inter - rater reliability : a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers .	1	psychology
 3457 . Instead , they use existing records to answer various research questions .	0	psychology
 This type of research approach is known as archival research .	0	psychology
 Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships .	1	psychology
 3460 . Even without significant life changes , some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project .	0	psychology
 As a result , the attrition rates , or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts , in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project .	1	psychology
 For this reason , researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end .	0	psychology
 3463 . In the end , research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions .	0	psychology
 Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .	1	psychology
 In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .	0	psychology
 3466 . We ’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas , but what sort of ideas are they , exactly ?	0	psychology
 A theory is a well - developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena .	1	psychology
 Theories are repeatedly checked against the world , but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once ; instead , researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory .	0	psychology
 3469 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .	1	psychology
 Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 However , a major criticism of Freud ’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable ; for example , it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the i d , the ego , and the superego — the three elements of personality described in Freud ’s theories .	0	psychology
 3472 . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism .	0	psychology
 An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .	1	psychology
 3475 . In some areas in psychology , it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty .	0	psychology
 In most cases , young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full - time faculty position .	0	psychology
 3478 . As the name suggests , biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior .	1	psychology
 While biological psychology is a broad field , many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3481 . As mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior .	1	psychology
 Thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions .	1	psychology
 Like biological psychology , cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds .	0	psychology
 3484 . Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique .	1	psychology
 Several individuals ( e.g. , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality .	0	psychology
 3487 . Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others .	1	psychology
 Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others , prejudice , and attraction , and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts .	1	psychology
 3490 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors .	1	psychology
 This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3493 . Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior .	1	psychology
 As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .	0	psychology
 3496 . Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system .	1	psychology
 For example , forensic psychologists ( and forensic psychiatrists ) will assess a person ’s competency to stand trial , assess the state of mind of a defendant , act as consultants on child custody cases , consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations , and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children ’s testimony ( American Board of Forensic Psychology , 2014 ) .	0	psychology
 3499 . These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it can not be seen by any other person .	0	psychology
 This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism .	1	psychology
 Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3502 . Perhaps one of the most influential and well - known figures in psychology ’s history was Sigmund Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Freud ( 1856–1939 ) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “ hysteria ” and neurosis .	0	psychology
 3505 . Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) .	0	psychology
 Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex , in which an animal or human produced a reflex ( unconscious ) response to a stimulus and , over time , was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus .	1	psychology
 3508 . Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior . B .	0	psychology
 F. Skinner ( 1904–1990 ) was an American psychologist ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences .	0	psychology
 3511 . Abraham Maslow ( 1908–1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here .	0	psychology
 3514 . Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli .	1	psychology
 Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain , hunger , thirst , sleepiness , and being aware of our thoughts and emotions .	0	psychology
 3517 . Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity .	1	psychology
 A woman ’s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm — a recurring , cyclical pattern of bodily changes .	0	psychology
 3520 . In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .	1	psychology
 Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance , or optimal level , within a biological system .	1	psychology
 3523 . One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .	1	psychology
 The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light .	1	psychology
 3526 . Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .	1	psychology
 These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 3529 . As we grow older , we sleep less .	0	psychology
 In fact , a meta - analysis , which is a study that combines the results of many related studies , conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old , we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day ( Ohayon , Carskadon , Guilleminault , & Vitiello , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 As the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan , presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly .	0	psychology
 3532 . Sleep can be divided into two different general phases : REM sleep and non - REM ( NREM ) sleep .	1	psychology
 Rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids .	1	psychology
 Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .	0	psychology
 3535 . In terms of brain wave activity , stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves .	0	psychology
 The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves , which are relatively low frequency ( 8–13Hz ) , high amplitude patterns of electrical activity ( waves ) that become synchronized ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed , yet awake .	0	psychology
 3538 . Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory ( Fogel & Smith , 2011 ; Poe , Walsh , & Bjorness , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .	0	psychology
 3541 . The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time .	0	psychology
 By the late 19th century , German psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious .	0	psychology
 By analyzing dreams , Freud thought people could increase self - awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives .	0	psychology
 3544 . The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious .	0	psychology
 The collective unconscious , as described by Jung , is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone .	1	psychology
 According to Jung , certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location .	0	psychology
 3547 . A parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted , disruptive motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role .	1	psychology
 Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep .	0	psychology
 3550 . A person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or when trying to fall asleep .	1	psychology
 This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs , which , not surprisingly , contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep .	0	psychology
 3553 . There are two types of sleep apnea : obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea .	0	psychology
 Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .	1	psychology
 In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 3556 . SIDSIn sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies .	1	psychology
 Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS , and boys have a greater risk than girls .	0	psychology
 3559 . The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) is used by clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders .	1	psychology
 Drug use disorders are addictive disorders , and the criteria for specific substance ( drug ) use disorders are described in DSM-5 .	0	psychology
 3562 . In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .	1	psychology
 Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level — even to the point of overdose and death .	0	psychology
 3565 . Stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity .	1	psychology
 Many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system .	0	psychology
 3568 . While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug , high blood levels of caffeine can result in insomnia , agitation , muscle twitching , nausea , irregular heartbeat , and even death ( Reissig , Strain , & Griffiths , 2009 ; Wolt , Ganetsky , & Babu , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 In 2012 , Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year - old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine .	0	psychology
 3571 . Thus , opioid drugs , which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism , have an extremely high potential for abuse .	0	psychology
 Natural opioids , called opiates , are derivatives of opium , which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant .	1	psychology
 There are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs ( correctly called opioids ) that have very potent painkilling effects , and they are often abused .	1	psychology
 3574 . Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency .	1	psychology
 It is often prescribed for minor pain , and it is available over - the - counter in some other countries .	0	psychology
 3577 . Meditation is the act of focusing on a single target ( such as the breath or a repeated sound ) to increase awareness of the moment .	1	psychology
 While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated , an individual can perform meditation alone .	1	psychology
 3580 . The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold .	0	psychology
 Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50 % of the time .	1	psychology
 Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time .	0	psychology
 3583 . While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment , it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world .	0	psychology
 Perception refers to the way sensory information is organized , interpreted , and consciously experienced .	1	psychology
 Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .	0	psychology
 3586 . In fact , we often do n’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time .	1	psychology
 This is known as sensory adaptation .	0	psychology
 Imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock .	0	psychology
 3589 . The shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception .	0	psychology
 For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .	0	psychology
 One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .	1	psychology
 3592 . The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .	1	psychology
 Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .	1	psychology
 3595 . Like light waves , the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound .	0	psychology
 The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound ’s pitch .	1	psychology
 High - frequency sound waves are perceived as high - pitched sounds , while low - frequency sound waves are perceived as low - pitched sounds .	1	psychology
 3598 . The eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .	1	psychology
 3601 . When light levels are high , the pupil will constrict , or become smaller , to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye .	1	psychology
 The pupil ’s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris , which is the colored portion of the eye .	0	psychology
 3604 . The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .	1	psychology
 The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .	0	psychology
 3607 . Rods and cones are connected ( via several interneurons ) to retinal ganglion cells .	0	psychology
 Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve .	1	psychology
 The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .	1	psychology
 3610 . Normal - sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision .	0	psychology
 Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .	0	psychology
 5806 . The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs .	0	government
 Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation , secure national borders , and the safety and well - being of citizens .	0	government
 1954 . 5818 .	0	government
 The government of the United States can best be described as a republic , or representative democracy .	0	government
 A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people . In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .	1	government
 5821 . However , in representative governments like the United States , minority rights are protected : people can not be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be .	0	government
 For example , let ’s say American society decided that atheists , people who do not believe that God exists , were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country .	0	government
 5827 . The foremost supporter of elite theory was C. Wright Mills .	0	government
 In his book , The Power Elite , Mills argued that government was controlled by a combination of business , military , and political elites . C .	0	government
 5830 . According to pluralist theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians .	1	government
 These groups include such entities as environmental advocates , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses .	0	government
 5833 . The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .	1	government
 Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .	1	government
 At the same time , neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone ’s right to free expression to interfere with someone else ’s ability to exercise his or her own rights .	0	government
 5836 . Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community .	0	government
 New York : Simon & Schuster , 75.Putnam argues that a decline in social capital—“the collective value of all ‘ social networks’ [ those whom people know ] and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other”—accompanies this decline in membership in small , interactive groups.——— .	0	government

 Therefore , one could be sure that election results were reliable and that the winning candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor .	0	government
 Common Cause has also advocated that the Electoral College be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote .	0	government
 5842 . Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today .	0	government
 Likewise , the sit - ins ( and sleep - ins and pray - ins ) staged by African American civil rights activists , which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters , motels , and churches , have been adopted today by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Other tactics , such as boycotting businesses of whose policies the activists disapproved , are also still common .	0	government
 5845 . Americans aged 18–29 were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older Americans .	0	government
 A 2015 poll of more than three thousand young adults by Harvard University ’s Institute of Politics revealed that only 22 percent claimed to be politically engaged , and fewer than 10 percent said that they belonged to any type of political organization or had volunteered for a political campaign .	0	government

 Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues .	0	government
 Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’s latent preferences or beliefs .	0	government
 Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time .	0	government
 5851 . Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .	0	government
 5854 . People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property .	1	government
 Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract .	0	government
 Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it , the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms .	0	government
 5857 . All this began to change in 1763 when the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France came to an end , and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America .	0	government
 The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain , and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France .	0	government
 5860 . The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .	0	government
 The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .	1	government

 This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party .	0	government
 Today , many who do not agree with the positions of the Democratic or the Republican Party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the Tea Party ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 5866 . In May 1775 , delegates met again in the Second Continental Congress .	0	government
 By this time , war with Great Britain had already begun , following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and British troops at Lexington and Concord , Massachusetts .	0	government
 5869 . Drafted by Thomas Jefferson , the Declaration of Independence officially proclaimed the colonies’ separation from Britain .	1	government
 In it , Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion .	0	government
 5872 . Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing .	0	government
 Thus , a confederation was created — an entity in which independent , self - governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense .	1	government
 Fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another , however , the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government .	0	government
 5875 . One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes .	0	government
 To avoid any perception of “ taxation without representation , ” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes .	0	government
 5878 . In 1786 , Virginia and Maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in Annapolis , Maryland , for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 However , only five states sent representatives .	0	government
 5881 . Fifty - five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 for the meeting that became known as the Constitutional Convention .	0	government
 Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful .	0	government
 5884 . Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .	1	government
 5887 . The Constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles .	0	government
 The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .	0	government
 5890 . The Three - Fifths Compromise , illustrated in [ link ] , resolved the impasse , although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone .	0	government
 For purposes of Congressional apportionment , slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population , including free African Americans and 60 percent ( three - fifths ) of their enslaved population .	0	government
 5893 . Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 Thus , Congress can pass laws , but its power to do so can be checked by the president , who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law .	0	government
 Later , in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison , the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws , a process called judicial review .	1	government
 5896 . All powers not expressly given to the national government , however , were intended to be exercised by the states .	1	government
 These powers are known as reserved powers ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Thus , states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce ( commerce within the borders of a state ) and marriage .	0	government
 5899 . This approach to ratification was an unusual one .	0	government
 Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states , changes to the nation ’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures .	0	government
 5902 . John Adams and Thomas Jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the Constitution .	0	government
 In the following excerpt ( reproduced as written ) from a letter dated March 15 , 1789 , after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen , Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution :	0	government
 5905 . Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .	0	government
 Although some Anti - Federalists , like Patrick Henry , were wealthy , most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “ the middling sort . ” This was certainly the fear of Melancton Smith , a New York merchant and landowner , who believed that power should rest in the hands of small , landowning farmers of average wealth who “ are more temperate , of better morals and less ambitious than the great.”Isaac Krannick .	0	government

 Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .	0	government
 5911 . An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .	0	government
 Similarly , Jay reminded New Yorkers in Federalist No .	0	government
 2 that union had been the goal of Americans since the time of the Revolution .	0	government
 5914 . Because these men would be members of a “ transient ” body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state , they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the “ heats and ferments ” of the voters .	0	government
 Indeed , Hamilton argued in Federalist No .	0	government
 70 , instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant , Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many .	0	government
 5917 . Responding to charges by Anti - Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals , the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens .	0	government
 James Madison , a member of Congress from Virginia , took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution .	0	government
 5920 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .	1	government
 Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .	0	government
 For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .	0	government
 5923 . Other liberties , however , do not derive from British precedents .	0	government
 The protections for religion , speech , the press , and assembly that are granted by the First Amendment did not exist under English law .	0	government
 ( The right to petition the government did , however . )	0	government
 5926 . The Supreme Court , for example , has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right .	1	government
 The Tenth Amendment , one of the first submitted to the states for ratification , ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution .	1	government
 This guarantee protects states’ reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage , divorce , and intrastate transportation and commerce , and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety .	0	government
 5929 . In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .	0	government
 The Twenty - Second Amendment , added in 1955 , limits the president to two terms in office , and the Twenty - Seventh Amendment , first submitted for ratification in 1789 , regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress .	1	government
 5932 . When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s , many that had allowed free , property - owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men .	0	government
 The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .	1	government
 After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .	1	government
 5935 . The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .	1	government
 The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .	1	government
 Many southern states had used a poll tax , a tax placed on voting , to prevent poor African Americans from voting .	0	government
 5938 . American federalism also seeks to balance the forces of decentralization and centralization .	0	government
 We see decentralization when we cross state lines and encounter different taxation levels , welfare eligibility requirements , and voting regulations , to name just a few .	0	government
 5941 . In the United States , conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts , with the U.S. Supreme Court being the final arbiter .	0	government
 The resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government , as illustrated recently when the Supreme Court ruled that states can not interfere with the federal government ’s actions relating to immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 In other instances , a Supreme Court ruling can erode that autonomy , as demonstrated in the 1940s when , in United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , the Court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states , a function previously handled exclusively by the states . United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , 315 U.S. 110 ( 1942 ) .	0	government
 5944 . In a confederation , authority is decentralized , and the central government ’s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments .	0	government
 Under the Articles of Confederation ( the first constitution of the United States ) , states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak .	1	government
 Because states were reluctant to give up any of their power , the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt , ending commercial disputes among states , negotiating trade agreements with other countries , and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country .	0	government

 However , when it came time to ratify the Constitution , a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states .	0	government
 What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .	0	government
 The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .	0	government
 5950 . The most important restriction Section 9 places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty .	0	government
 Specifically , the government can not suspend the writ of habeas corpus , which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person ’s detention is legal ; pass a bill of attainder , a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial ; or enact an ex post facto law , which criminalizes an act retroactively .	0	government
 The Bill of Rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions , ensuring that the government can not encroach on personal freedoms .	0	government
 5953 . Various constitutional provisions govern state - to - state relations .	0	government
 Article IV , Section 1 , referred to as the full faith and credit clause or the comity clause , requires the states to accept court decisions , public acts , and contracts of other states .	0	government
 Thus , an adoption certificate or driver ’s license issued in one state is valid in any other state .	0	government

 The federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor struck down the part of DOMA that outlawed federal benefits . United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 That move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states .	0	government

 Two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early 1900s .	0	government
 First , the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 authorized Congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population , a burdensome provision that Article I , Section 9 , had imposed on the national government . Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co. , 158 U.S. 601 ( 1895 ) .	0	government
 With this change , the federal government ’s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend . The second development regulates federal grants , that is , transfers of federal money to state and local governments .	0	government

 In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .	1	government
 Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”	0	government

 But , the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to Native Americans .	0	government

 First , the amendment says , “ no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States , ” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV , Section 2 , of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens .	0	government

 6076 . Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .	0	government
 For example , in Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) .	0	government
 6079 . When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well .	0	government

The key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing , in Thomas Jefferson ’s words , “ a wall of separation between church and state . ” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v.

The rights of conscientious objectors — individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought , conscience , or religion — have also been controversial , although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non - combatant medics during wartime .	0	government
 To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .	0	government
 6091 . In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .	0	government
 It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ” In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .	0	government
 This standard became known as the Sherbert test .	0	government
 Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government , the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs .	0	government

 6097 . Although the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights — free speech , press , assembly , and petition — we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression , particularly since the world ’s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication ( i.e. , speech and press ) in the centuries since the First Amendment was written and adopted .	0	government

 In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	0	government
 This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers .

 Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .	1	psychology
 3979 . He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child ( 1988 ) .	0	psychology
 A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings .	1	psychology
 Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment : The caregiver must be responsive to the child ’s physical , social , and emotional needs ; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions ( Bowlby , 1969 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3982 . In cases of resistant attachment , children tend to show clingy behavior , but then they reject the attachment figure ’s attempts to interact with them ( Ainsworth & Bell , 1970 ) .	1	psychology
 These children do not explore the toys in the room , as they are too fearful .	0	psychology
 3985 . In authoritarian style , the parent places high value on conformity and obedience .	1	psychology
 The parents are often strict , tightly monitor their children , and express little warmth .	0	psychology
 3988 . As you can see , parenting styles influence childhood adjustment , but could a child ’s temperament likewise influence parenting ?	0	psychology
 Temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks , behaves , and reacts with the environment .	1	psychology
 Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions , adapt well to change , and are capable of regulating their emotions .	0	psychology
 3991 . Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .	0	psychology
 Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .	1	psychology
 Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 3994 . Cognitive empathy , also known as theory - of - mind ( which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism ) , relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others ( Shamay - Tsoory , Tomer , & Aharon - Peretz , 2005 ) .	1	psychology
 Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance .	0	psychology
 3997 . In contrast , until about 50 years ago in the United States , a doctor might not inform someone that they were dying , and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals .	0	psychology
 In 1967 that reality began to change with Cicely Saunders , who created the first modern hospice in England .	0	psychology
 The aim of hospice is to help provide a death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment , which is usually outside of a hospital setting .	1	psychology

 4006 . Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self - esteem or positive self - image .	0	psychology
 Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) .	1	psychology
 Festinger ’s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self - perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) .	1	psychology
 4009 . Besides the classic military example and group initiation , can you think of other examples of cognitive dissonance ?	0	psychology
 Here is one : Marco and Maria live in Fairfield County , Connecticut , which is one of the wealthiest areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living .	0	psychology
 4012 . After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .	0	psychology
 Out of this work came a model called the Yale attitude change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes .	0	psychology
 Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message , the content of the message , and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message ( Hovland , Janis , & Kelley , 1953 ) .	0	psychology
 4015 . The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .	1	psychology
 Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement .	0	psychology
 4018 . The remaining members of the group were confederates of the researcher .	0	psychology
 A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher .	1	psychology
 Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design , and the true , naïve participants believe that confederates are , like them , uninformed participants in the experiment .	0	psychology
 4021 . The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not coerced by others ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The Asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something .	0	psychology
 For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority .	0	psychology
 4024 . Another form of social influence is obedience to authority .	0	psychology
 Obedience is the change of an individual ’s behavior to comply with a demand by an authority figure .	1	psychology
 People often comply with the request because they are concerned about a consequence if they do not comply .	0	psychology
 4027 . Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink .	0	psychology
 Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus ( Janis , 1972 ) .	1	psychology
 In group situations , the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do .	0	psychology
 4030 . Social LoafingAnother way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing .	0	psychology
 Social loafing is the exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group .	1	psychology
 Social loafing occurs when our individual performance can not be evaluated separately from the group .	0	psychology
 4033 . As a consequence of its concern for candidate characteristics , industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination in hiring .	0	psychology
 Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees affect those employees and the performance of a business .	1	psychology
 This includes studying worker satisfaction , motivation , and commitment .	0	psychology
 4036 . The involvement of the United States in World War I in April 1917 catalyzed the participation in the military effort of psychologists working in this area .	0	psychology
 At that time Yerkes was the president of the 25-year - old American Psychological Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 The APA is a professional association in the United States for clinical and research psychologists .	1	psychology
 4039 . Gilbreth was another influential I - O psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Using time and motion studies , Gilbreth and her husband , Frank , worked to make workers more efficient by reducing the number of motions required to perform a task .	0	psychology
 4042 . How did your prejudice develop ?	0	psychology
 Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics .	1	psychology
 Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group .	0	psychology
 4045 . Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex .	1	psychology
 Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex .	0	psychology
 4048 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .	1	psychology
 Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 Negative feelings often result in discrimination , such as the exclusion of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people from social groups and the avoidance of LGBT neighbors and co - workers .	0	psychology
 4051 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .	0	psychology
 A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .	1	psychology
 When we hold stereotypes about a person , we tend to treat the person according to our expectations .	0	psychology
 4054 . An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .	1	psychology
 A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .	1	psychology
 For example , if you are female , your gender in - group includes all females , and your gender out - group includes all males ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4057 . Humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person .	0	psychology
 Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .	1	psychology
 4060 . For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person .	0	psychology
 Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) .	0	psychology
 This theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal , they become frustrated and aggressive .	1	psychology
 4063 . With the rapid growth of technology , and widely available mobile technology and social networking media , a new form of bullying has emerged : cyberbullying ( Hoff & Mitchell , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 Cyberbullying , like bullying , is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional harm to another person .	1	psychology
 What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert , concealed , done in private , and the bully can remain anonymous .	0	psychology
 4066 . Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation .	0	psychology
 Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police .	0	psychology
 4069 . Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy .	0	psychology
 Empathy is the capacity to understand another person ’s perspective , to feel what he or she feels .	1	psychology
 An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help ( Batson , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 4072 . Self - disclosure is part of the two way street .	0	psychology
 Self - disclosure is the sharing of personal information ( Laurenceau , Barrett , & Pietromonaco , 1998 ) .	1	psychology
 We form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose important information about ourselves .	0	psychology
 4075 . Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion .	1	psychology
 Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion .	1	psychology
 Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .	1	psychology
 4081 . Performance appraisals are typically documented several times a year , often with a formal process and an annual face - to - face brief meeting between an employee and his supervisor .	0	psychology
 It is important that the original job analysis play a role in performance appraisal as well as any goals that have been set by the employee or by the employee and supervisor .	0	psychology
 4084 . The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) of 1990 states people may not be discriminated against due to the nature of their disability .	1	psychology
 A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities such as hearing , walking , and breathing .	1	psychology
 4087 . Some people love their jobs , some people tolerate their jobs , and some people can not stand their jobs .	0	psychology
 Job satisfaction describes the degree to which individuals enjoy their job .	1	psychology
 It was described by Edwin Locke ( 1976 ) as the state of feeling resulting from appraising one ’s job experiences .	0	psychology
 4090 . Many people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of their home life , whether it be caring for children or taking care of an elderly parent ; this is known as work - family balance .	1	psychology
 We might commonly think about work interfering with family , but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with work obligations ( Carlson , Kacmar , & Williams , 2000 ) .	0	psychology
 4093 . His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .	0	psychology
 In the Theory X approach to management , managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self - directed .	1	psychology
 Theory X managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks to perform and when .	0	psychology
 4096 . This is in contrast to the transformational leader .	0	psychology
 People who have transformational leadership possess four attributes to varying degrees : They are charismatic ( highly liked role models ) , inspirational ( optimistic about goal attainment ) , intellectually stimulating ( encourage critical thinking and problem solving ) , and considerate ( Bass , Avolio , & Atwater , 1996 ) .	1	psychology
 4099 . Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand cultural differences .	0	psychology
 Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of improving teamwork .	1	psychology
 There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups , but the evidence suggests that simply working together , particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that such prejudice can be reduced or eliminated .	0	psychology
 4102 . Workplace violence is one aspect of workplace safety that I - O psychologists study .	0	psychology
 Workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence , harassment , intimidation , or other threatening , disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace .	1	psychology
 It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide ( Occupational Safety & Health Administration , 2014 ) .	0	psychology
 4105 . One of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist .	0	psychology
 The airline industry is one industry that uses checklists .	0	psychology
 4108 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	1	psychology
 A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .	0	psychology
 4111 . The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal : judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be ( Lyon , 2012 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 As you may recall from what you learned about self - efficacy , an individual ’s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( Bandura , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 4117 . Selye and the General Adaptation SyndromeAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye , mentioned earlier .	0	psychology
 He would eventually become one of the world ’s foremost experts in the study of stress ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4120 . If exposure to a stressor is prolonged , the organism will enter the stage of resistance .	0	psychology
 During this stage , the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor .	1	psychology
 4123 . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body .	0	psychology
 Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight .	1	psychology
 However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .	0	psychology
 4126 . As our society becomes increasingly multiethnic and multiracial , mental health professionals must develop cultural competence ( [ link ] ) , which means they must understand and address issues of race , culture , and ethnicity .	1	psychology
 They must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application ( Sue , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 4129 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .	0	psychology
 They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	1	psychology
 Many life events that most people would consider pleasant ( e.g. , holidays , retirement , marriage ) are among those listed on the SRRS ; these are examples of eustress .	0	psychology
 4132 . Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job .	0	psychology
 Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) .	1	psychology
 Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in [ link ] involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e.g. , inability to decide when to take breaks ) .	0	psychology
 4135 . Frequently , a person who is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol has an additional psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Saying a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses .	1	psychology
 This can often be a substance - related diagnosis and another psychiatric diagnosis , such as depression , bipolar disorder , or schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 4138 . Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional factors are called psychophysiological disorders .	1	psychology
 The physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors ( hence the psycho and physiological in psychophysiological ) .	0	psychology
 4141 . The question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated researchers for over three decades , and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of health psychology ( Kiecolt - Glaser , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning .	1	psychology
 The term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981 , when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain , endocrine system , and immune system ( Zacharie , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 4144 . The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system .	1	psychology
 For many years , disorders that involve the cardiovascular system — known as cardiovascular disorders — have been a major focal point in the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system ’s centrality in the stress response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	1	psychology
 Heart disease is one such condition .	0	psychology
 4147 . Also , one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical students from 32 to 48 years .	0	psychology
 At the beginning of the study , these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure ; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger , whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger .	0	psychology
 Decades later , researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55 , and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age ( Chang , Ford , Meoni , Wang , & Klag , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4150 . Asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed , leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs .	1	psychology
 The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways ( leading to thickening of the airway walls ) and a tightening of the muscles around them , resulting in a narrowing of the airways ( [ link ] ) ( American Lung Association , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 4156 . Family therapy is a special form of group therapy , consisting of one or more families .	1	psychology
 Although there are many theoretical orientations in family therapy , one of the most predominant is the systems approach .	0	psychology
 4159 . Both types of treatment help people with psychological disorders , such as depression , anxiety , and schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 Psychotherapy is a psychological treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems , or to attain personal growth .	1	psychology
 In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .	0	psychology
 4162 . In a psychoanalyst ’s office , you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories , and the therapist using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In free association , the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment .	1	psychology
 However , Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block , or repress , unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association .	0	psychology
 4165 . Today , Freud ’s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies : the psychodynamic perspective .	0	psychology
 This approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people ’s internal drives and forces , but treatment is less intensive than Freud ’s original model .	0	psychology
 4168 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .	1	psychology
 In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .	1	psychology
 Therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors , like phobias and bedwetting , can be changed by teaching clients new , more constructive behaviors .	0	psychology
 4171 . In exposure therapy , a therapist seeks to treat clients’ fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem , with the idea that they will eventually get used to it .	1	psychology
 This can be done via reality , imagination , or virtual reality .	0	psychology
 4174 . One popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy .	0	psychology
 This involves a controlled setting where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens , such as a poker chip , that can be exchanged for items or privileges .	1	psychology
 4177 . PSYCHOTHERAPY : COGNITIVE - BEHAVIORAL THERAPYCognitive - behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient ’s childhood or past , as in other forms of psychotherapy .	1	psychology
 One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .	1	psychology
 Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009).Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .	1	psychology
 4180 . Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian , or client - centered therapy .	0	psychology
 Note the change from patients to clients .	0	psychology
 4183 . While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy , they also are taken by individuals not in therapy .	0	psychology
 This is known as biomedical therapy .	0	psychology
 Medications used to treat psychological disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors , including psychiatrists .	1	psychology
 4186 . When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .	0	psychology
 Coping refers to mental and behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress , including its presumed cause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces .	1	psychology
 4189 . As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things .	0	psychology
 Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) .	1	psychology
 Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well - being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 4192 . While having social support is quite beneficial , being the recipient of prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes .	0	psychology
 In their literature review , Brondolo , Brady , Pencille , Beatty , and Contrada ( 2009 ) describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique , significant stressors for those who are the targets of such attitudes and behavior .	0	psychology
 Being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression , lowered self - esteem , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease .	0	psychology
 4195 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :	1	psychology
 4198 . Although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating , it is — admittedly — somewhat of a grim topic .	0	psychology
 Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and encouraging approach to human affairs — the quest for happiness .	0	psychology
 4201 . In 1998 , Seligman ( the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier ) , who was then president of the American Psychological Association , urged psychologists to focus more on understanding how to build human strength and psychological well - being .	0	psychology
 In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4204 . In terms of our health , the expression , “ do n’t worry , be happy ” is helpful advice indeed .	0	psychology
 There has also been much work suggesting that optimism — the general tendency to look on the bright side of things — is also a significant predictor of positive health outcomes .	1	psychology
 4207 . In the late 1700s , a French physician , Philippe Pinel , argued for more humane treatment of the mentally ill .	0	psychology
 He suggested that they be unchained and talked to , and that ’s just what he did for patients at La Salpêtrière in Paris in 1795 ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4210 . If an individual is mandated to attend therapy , she is seeking services involuntarily .	0	psychology
 Involuntary treatment refers to therapy that is not the individual ’s choice .	1	psychology
 Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment .	0	psychology
 4213 . Diego likely has attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .	0	psychology
 The symptoms of this disorder were first described by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s .	0	psychology
 4216 . Despite the retraction , the reporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting .	0	psychology
 A recent survey of parents , for example , found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern ( Kennedy , LaVail , Nowak , Basket , & Landry , 2011 ) ; and perhaps fearing that their children would develop autism , more than 10 % of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 Some parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine - autism link .	0	psychology
 5222 . It matters because the support of farmers in high - income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low - income countries .	0	economic
 Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .	0	economic
 5225 . U.S. producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar .	0	economic
 The effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States can be measured using two concepts developed in Demand , Supply , and Efficiency : consumer surplus and producer surplus . U.S .	0	economic
 Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade , the equilibrium is at point A .	0	economic
 5228 . Lost sales translate into lost jobs .	0	economic
 The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries .	0	economic
 This is why the United States International Trade Commission , in its study of barriers to trade , predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs .	0	economic
 5231 . Workers in many low - income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States .	0	economic
 Workers in countries like China , Thailand , Brazil , South Africa , and Poland are often paid less than the United States minimum wage .	0	economic
 For example , in the United States , the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour ; a typical wage in many low - income countries might be more like $ 7.25 per day , or often much less .	0	economic
 5234 . Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .	1	economic
 Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .	1	economic
 Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .	0	economic
 5237 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .	0	economic
 In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .	0	economic
 5240 . One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security .	0	economic
 In 1954 , the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms , so it declared wool and mohair to be “ strategic materials ” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers .	0	economic
 5243 . There are different types of economic integration across the globe , ranging from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or quotas , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated .	1	economic
 Many nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements .	0	economic

 In contrast , in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave , the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation .	1	physics
 [ link ] shows an example of a longitudinal wave .	0	physics
 2903 . [ link ] shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase — that is , precisely aligned crest to trough — producing pure destructive interference .	0	physics
 Because the disturbances are in the opposite direction for this superposition , the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference — the waves completely cancel .	0	physics
 2906 . The fixed ends of strings must be nodes , too , because the string can not move there .	0	physics
 The word antinode is used to denote the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves .	1	physics
 Standing waves on strings have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed vwvw size 12{v rSub { size 8{w } } } { } of the disturbance on the string .	0	physics
 2909 . Because hearing is one of our most important senses , it is interesting to see how the physical properties of sound correspond to our perceptions of it .	0	physics
 Hearing is the perception of sound , just as vision is the perception of visible light .	1	physics
 But sound has important applications beyond hearing .	0	physics
 2912 . Note that because only the ratio I2/I1I2/I1 is given ( and not the actual intensities ) , this result is true for any intensities that differ by a factor of two .	0	physics
 For example , a 56.0 dB sound is twice as intense as a 53.0 dB sound , a 97.0 dB sound is half as intense as a 100 dB sound , and so on . It should be noted at this point that there is another decibel scale in use , called the sound pressure level , based on the ratio of the pressure amplitude to a reference pressure .	0	physics
 This scale is used particularly in applications where sound travels in water .	0	physics
 2915 . Interference microscopes enhance contrast between objects and background by superimposing a reference beam of light upon the light emerging from the sample .	1	physics
 Since light from the background and objects differ in phase , there will be different amounts of constructive and destructive interference , producing the desired contrast in final intensity .	0	physics
 2918 . Apart from the UV microscope , the variations of microscopy discussed so far in this section are available as attachments to fairly standard microscopes or as slight variations .	0	physics
 The next level of sophistication is provided by commercial confocal microscopes , which use the extended focal region shown in [ link](b ) to obtain three - dimensional images rather than two - dimensional images .	1	physics
 Here , only a single plane or region of focus is identified ; out - of - focus regions above and below this plane are subtracted out by a computer so the image quality is much better .	0	physics
 2921 . We use specific terms for the resonances in any system .	0	physics
 The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental , while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones .	1	physics
 All resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental , and they are collectively called harmonics .	1	physics
 2924 . Normal human hearing encompasses frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz , an impressive range .	0	physics
 Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound , whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound .	1	physics
 Neither is perceived by the ear , although infrasound can sometimes be felt as vibrations .	0	physics
 2927 . Very few measuring devices are capable of observations over a range of a trillion .	0	physics
 The perception of intensity is called loudness .	1	physics
 At a given frequency , it is possible to discern differences of about 1 dB , and a change of 3 dB is easily noticed .	0	physics
 2930 . Another major use of ultrasound in medical diagnostics is to detect motion and determine velocity through the Doppler shift of an echo , known as Doppler - shifted ultrasound .	1	physics
 This technique is used to monitor fetal heartbeat , measure blood velocity , and detect occlusions in blood vessels , for example .	0	physics
 2933 . How do we know there are two types of electric charge ?	0	physics
 When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways , certain combinations of materials always produce one type of charge on one material and the opposite type on the other .	0	physics
 2936 . In fact , in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant .	1	physics
 This universally obeyed law of nature is called the law of conservation of charge .	0	physics
 1520 . The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans , as visible in the micrograph shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin . These hormones regulate blood glucose levels .	1	biology

 1526 . Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over - hydration ( hyponatremia ) .	1	biology
 The water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus , which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid .	1	biology
 The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration , inadequate water intake , or low blood volume due to blood loss .	0	biology
 1532 . Regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland , the adrenal cortex , and the gonads .	0	biology
 During puberty in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , which stimulates the production and release of follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 These hormones regulate the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) and therefore are called gonadotropins .	1	biology
 1538 . In order to manage nutrient intake , storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary , the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores .	0	biology
 Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas , which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise ( for example , after a meal is consumed ) .	1	biology
 Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells , which use glucose for ATP production .	0	biology
 1547 . T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .	0	biology
 Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid , and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine .	0	biology
 1550 . In children , hypothyroidism can cause cretinism , which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects .	0	biology
 Hyperthyroidism , the overproduction of thyroid hormones , can lead to an increased metabolic rate and its effects : weight loss , excess heat production , sweating , and an increased heart rate .	1	biology
 Graves’ disease is one example of a hyperthyroid condition .	0	biology
 1562 . In a long - term stress response , the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids .	1	biology
 Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells .	0	biology
 1565 . Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing ’s disease , characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body .	1	biology
 This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck , and excessive glucose in the blood .	0	biology
 1568 . A hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid - filled compartment within the body , called the coelom .	1	biology
 The organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid , which also resists external compression .	0	biology
 1571 . The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull , ossicles of the middle ear , hyoid bone of the throat , vertebral column , and the thoracic cage ( ribcage ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The function of the axial skeleton is to provide support and protection for the brain , the spinal cord , and the organs in the ventral body cavity .	0	biology
 1574 . The auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid - filled cochlea .	1	biology
 The auditory ossicles consist of three bones each : the malleus , incus , and stapes .	0	biology
 1577 . The vertebral column , or spinal column , surrounds and protects the spinal cord , supports the head , and acts as an attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck .	1	biology
 The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones : the 24 vertebrae , the sacrum , and the coccyx bones .	0	biology
 1580 . The sternum , or breastbone , is a long , flat bone located at the anterior of the chest .	1	biology
 It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult .	0	biology
 1583 . The pectoral girdle bones provide the points of attachment of the upper limbs to the axial skeleton .	1	biology
 The human pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle ( or collarbone ) in the anterior , and the scapula ( or shoulder blades ) in the posterior ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1589 . The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones : the ulna and the radius .	1	biology
 The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .	1	biology
 The ulna is located on the medial aspect ( pinky - finger side ) of the forearm .	1	biology
 1592 . The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton .	1	biology
 Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion , the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments .	0	biology
 1595 . The femur , or thighbone , is the longest , heaviest , and strongest bone in the body .	1	biology
 The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the proximal end .	0	biology
 1598 . It is the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot .	0	biology
 The fibula , or calf bone , parallels and articulates with the tibia .	1	biology
 It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight .	0	biology
 1601 . The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint , or articulation .	1	biology
 Joints are responsible for movement , such as the movement of limbs , and stability , such as the stability found in the bones of the skull .	0	biology
 1604 . Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue , allowing for more movement than in a suture .	1	biology
 An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle .	0	biology
 1613 . Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other .	1	biology
 Gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones .	0	biology
 1619 . Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side .	0	biology
 Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction .	0	biology
 1625 . Eversion is the opposite of inversion , movement of the sole of the foot outward , away from the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane .	1	biology
 Retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction .	1	biology
 1631 . Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	1	biology
 1634 . Planar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces .	1	biology
 These joints allow for gliding movements , and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints .	0	biology
 1637 . Condyloid joints consist of an oval - shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval - shaped hollow of another bone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint .	0	biology
 1640 . Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles , which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can be consciously controlled .	1	biology
 Because it can be controlled by thought , skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle .	0	biology
 1643 . Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart , and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure .	1	biology
 Like skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle is striated , but unlike skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle can not be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle .	1	biology
 1646 . Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line .	0	biology
 The Z discs mark the border of units called sarcomeres , which are the functional units of skeletal muscle .	1	biology
 One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band , one on either side of the A band .	0	biology
 1649 . Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .	1	biology
 Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .	1	biology
 The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance , as there is little space between the filaments .	0	biology
 1652 . Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron , which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle .	1	biology
 The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate .	1	biology
 The end of the neuron ’s axon is called the synaptic terminal , and it does not actually contact the motor end plate .	1	biology
 1655 . The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite , a mineral formed from calcium phosphate .	0	biology
 Calcification is the process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue .	1	biology
 The process of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1658 . The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	1	biology
 The rounded ends , the epiphyses , are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Most of the limb bones are long bones — for example , the femur , tibia , ulna , and radius .	0	biology
 1661 . Irregular bones are bones with complex shapes .	1	biology
 These bones may have short , flat , notched , or ridged surfaces .	0	biology
 1664 . Compact bone ( or cortical bone ) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity , or bone marrow .	1	biology
 It provides protection and strength to bones .	0	biology
 1667 . Each osteon consists of lamellae , which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal .	1	biology
 The Haversian canal ( osteonic canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing .	0	biology
 1670 . Bone consists of four types of cells : osteoblasts , osteoclasts , osteocytes , and osteoprogenitor cells .	0	biology
 Osteoblasts are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation .	1	biology
 Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue , and collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1673 . Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix .	1	biology
 Osteoprogenitor cells are squamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts .	1	biology
 Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures .	0	biology
 1676 . Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage .	1	biology
 All of the bones of the body , except for the flat bones of the skull , mandible , and clavicles , are formed through endochondral ossification .	0	biology
 1679 . Bone renewal continues after birth into adulthood .	0	biology
 Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue .	1	biology
 It involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts .	0	biology
 1682 . The right lung is larger and contains three lobes , whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The muscular diaphragm , which facilitates breathing , is inferior to ( below ) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity . The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs .	1	biology
 The right lung is made of three lobes and is larger .	0	biology
 1685 . Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .	0	biology
 Like the trachea , the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle .	0	biology
 1688 . The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .	0	biology
 At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .	0	biology
 1691 . If particulates do make it beyond the nose , or enter through the mouth , the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain several protective devices .	0	biology
 The lungs produce mucus — a sticky substance made of mucin , a complex glycoprotein , as well as salts and water — that traps particulates .	1	biology
 The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia , small hair - like projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1694 . The volume in the lung can be divided into four units : tidal volume , expiratory reserve volume , inspiratory reserve volume , and residual volume .	0	biology
 Tidal volume ( TV ) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath .	1	biology
 On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .	0	biology
 1697 . Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .	1	biology
 The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .	1	biology
 The lungs are never completely empty : There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation .	0	biology
 1700 . It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 The functional residual capacity ( FRC ) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume .	0	biology
 The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 1703 . Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .	0	biology
 An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .	1	biology
 In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .	1	biology
 1706 . To increase the volume of the lungs , the chest wall expands .	0	biology
 This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles , the muscles that are connected to the rib cage .	1	biology
 Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract , thus expanding the thoracic cavity .	0	biology
 1709 . A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .	0	biology
 Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .	0	biology
 1712 . On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .	0	biology
 The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation , or how much air moves into and out of the alveoli .	1	biology
 Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli .	0	biology
 1715 . Babies born prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant .	0	biology
 As a result , they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome , because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs .	0	biology
 Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli .	0	biology
 1718 . In these types of restrictive diseases , the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation , which traps air in the lungs .	0	biology
 Forced or functional vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible , is much lower than in normal patients , and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is greatly prolonged ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A patient suffering from these diseases can not exhale the normal amount of air .	0	biology
 1721 . At times , however , there is a mismatch between the amount of air ( ventilation , V ) and the amount of blood ( perfusion , Q ) in the lungs .	1	biology
 This is referred to as ventilation / perfusion ( V / Q ) mismatch .	0	biology
 1724 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .	0	biology
 1727 . The oxygen - carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood .	0	biology
 In addition to	0	biology
 1730 . This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin , a molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed .	0	biology
 Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible .	0	biology
 1733 . However , hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and thus limits shifts in pH .	0	biology
 The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion ( Cl- ) ; this is called the chloride shift .	1	biology
 When the blood reaches the lungs , the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion .	0	biology
 1736 . In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .	1	biology
 As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .	0	biology
 This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange .	0	biology
 1739 . This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .	0	biology
 The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .	1	biology
 In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .	1	biology
 1742 . The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen - rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit .	0	biology
 For this reason , amphibians are often described as having double circulation . Most reptiles also have a three - chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits , as shown in [ link]c . The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum , which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood .	0	biology
 1745 . Red blood cells , or erythrocytes ( erythro- = “ red ” ; -cyte = “ cell ” ) , are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells ; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow .	1	biology
 In mammals , red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7–8 µm in size .	0	biology
 1748 . In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .	1	biology
 This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve , a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood .	1	biology
 The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .	1	biology
 1751 . The heart is composed of three layers ; the epicardium , the myocardium , and the endocardium , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .	1	biology
 The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 1754 . The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood .	0	biology
 The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .	1	biology
 They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .	0	biology
 1757 . Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .	0	biology
 The slowdown of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain , known as angina , and complete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction : the death of cardiac muscle tissue , commonly known as a heart attack .	1	biology
 1760 . The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells , or cardiomyocytes , that make up the heart muscle .	0	biology
 Cardiomyocytes , shown in [ link ] , are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle ; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle .	1	biology
 They are self - stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes .	0	biology
 1763 . The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Arteries take blood away from the heart .	1	biology
 The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs .	1	biology
 1766 . Fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries .	0	biology
 The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .	0	biology
 Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .	1	biology
 1769 . Blood pressure ( BP ) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body .	1	biology
 Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating .	1	biology
 1772 . Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute .	1	biology
 It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute ( heart rate ) times the stroke volume ( the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle ) .	1	biology
 Therefore , cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate , as when exercising .	0	biology
 1775 . Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .	1	biology
 1778 . In order to calculate osmotic pressure , it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured .	0	biology
 The unit for measuring solutes is the mole .	0	biology
 One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute .	1	biology
 1781 . Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms .	1	biology
 This is possible because some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments .	0	biology
 When they live in fresh water , their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic , as illustrated in [ link]a .	0	biology
 1784 . Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration .	0	biology
 The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called urine .	1	biology
 1787 . The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	0	biology
 The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	0	biology
 Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .	0	biology
 1790 . The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .	1	biology
 The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	1	biology
 In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .	1	biology
 1793 . The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .	1	biology
 The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	1	biology
 1796 . The arteries , veins , and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum .	0	biology
 Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .	0	biology
 The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 1799 . Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .	1	biology
 1802 . There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .	1	biology

 U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .	0	government
 Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 6474 . The argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy .	0	government
 Under this model of proportional representation , legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election .	1	government
 As a result , any given election can have multiple winners , and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 But the national conventions , organized and sponsored by the national - level party , can dominate the national discussion for several weeks in late summer , a time when the major media outlets are often searching for news .	0	government
 These conventions are the definition of a media circus at which high - ranking politicians , party elites , and sometimes celebrities , such as actor / director Clint Eastwood ( [ link ] ) , along with individuals many consider to be the future leaders of the party are brought before the public so the party can make its best case for being the one to direct the future of the country .

 6498 . The past thirty years have brought a dramatic change in the relationship between the two parties as fewer conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans have been elected to office .	0	government
 As political moderates , or individuals with ideologies in the middle of the ideological spectrum , leave the political parties at all levels , the parties have grown farther apart ideologically , a result called party polarization .	1	government
 In other words , at least organizationally and in government , Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly dissimilar from one another ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 6513 . But whereas interest groups often work indirectly to influence our leaders , political parties are organizations that try to directly influence public policy through its members who seek to win and hold public office .	1	government
 Parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections ; their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform ( [ link ] ) , which is adopted at each party ’s presidential nominating convention every four years .	0	government

 This exception is encoded within the Constitution in Article I , Section 7 , which states , “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . ” Yet , despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution , Congress has found ways to get around this rule .	0	government
 6621 . This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster .	0	government
 The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate .	0	government
 6624 . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government

 More recently , presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements ( discussed later in this chapter ) directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation .	0	government
 6681 . However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 The act gave the president first - mover advantage in the budget process via the first “ executive budget . ” It also created the first - ever budget staff at the disposal of a president , at the time called the Bureau of the Budget but decades later renamed the Office of Management and Budget ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 6684 . In somewhat of a countervailing trend in the general election stage of the process , by the presidential election of 1824 , many states were using popular elections to choose their electors .	0	government
 This became important in that election when Andrew Jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of electors , but the presidency was given to John Quincy Adams instead .	0	government
 Out of the frustration of Jackson ’s supporters emerged a powerful two - party system that took control of the selection process . Daniel Myron Greene .	0	government
 6687 . The 2016 elections seem to support the idea that the primary process produces a nominee rather than party insiders .	0	government
 Outsiders Donald Trump on the Republican side and Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side had much success despite significant concerns about them from party elites .	0	government
 Whether this pattern could be reversed in the case of a closely contested selection process remains to be seen .	0	government
 6690 . The Twelfth Amendment , ratified in 1804 , provided for the separate election of president and vice president as well as setting out ways to choose a winner if no one received a majority of the electoral votes .	1	government
 Only once since the passage of the Twelfth Amendment , during the election of 1824 , has the House selected the president under these rules , and only once , in 1836 , has the Senate chosen the vice president .	0	government
 6693 . Nor has public funding helped to solve the problem .	0	government
 Indeed , starting with Barack Obama ’s 2008 decision to forfeit public funding so as to skirt the spending limitations imposed , candidates now regularly opt to raise more money rather than to take public funding . Jason Scott - Sheets , “ Public financing is available for presidential candidates .	0	government
 So what ’s not to like about free money ? ” 14 April 2016 , http://www.opensecrets.org / news/2016/04/public - financing - is - available - for - presidential - candidates - so - whats - not - to - like - about - free - money/ .	0	government
 In addition , political action committees ( PACs ) , supposedly focused on issues rather than specific candidates , seek to influence the outcome of the race by supporting or opposing a candidate according to the PAC ’s own interests .	1	government
 6696 . These include the heads of the Internal Revenue Service , the Central Intelligence Agency , the Office of Management and Budget , the Federal Reserve , the Social Security Administration , the Environmental Protection Agency , the National Labor Relations Board , and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .	0	government
 The Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) is the president ’s own budget department .	0	government
 In addition to preparing the executive budget proposal and overseeing budgetary implementation during the federal fiscal year , the OMB oversees the actions of the executive bureaucracy .	0	government

 3 : 226–243 .	0	government
 Despite the fact that one - third of U.S. presidents have appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year , when Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared that the Senate would not hold hearings on a nominee until after the upcoming presidential election . Barbara Perry , “ One - third of all U.S. presidents appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year , ” Washington Post , 29 February 2016 , https://www.washingtonpost.com / news / monkey - cage / wp/2016/02/29/one - third - of - all - u - s - presidents - appointed - a - supreme - court - justice - in - an - election - year/ .	0	government
 McConnell remained adamant even after President Barack Obama , saying he was acting in fulfillment of his constitutional duty , nominated Merrick Garland , longtime chief judge of the federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit .	0	government
 Garland is highly respected by senators from both parties and won confirmation to his DC circuit position by a 76–23 vote in the Senate .	0	government
 6702 . When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .	0	government
 Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .	0	government
 Nor is this phenomenon restricted to nominations for the highest court in the land .	0	government
 6705 . Indeed , until the twentieth century , many presidents had little to do with the naming of their running mate at the nominating convention .	0	government
 The office was seen as a form of political exile , and that motivated Republicans to name Theodore Roosevelt as William McKinley ’s running mate in 1900 .	0	government
 The strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity .	0	government
 6708 . But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .	0	government
 Sometimes , as in the case of Bill Clinton and Al Gore , the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious .	0	government
 In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .	0	government
 6711 . The first act undertaken by the new president — the delivery of an inaugural address — can do much to set the tone for what is intended to follow .	0	government
 While such an address may be an exercise in rhetorical inspiration , it also allows the president to set forth priorities within the overarching vision of what he or she intends to do .	1	government
 5604 . A certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative inflexibility of the labor market , considered structural unemployment , which describes when there is a societal level of disjuncture between people seeking jobs and the available jobs .	1	sociology
 This mismatch can be geographic ( they are hiring in California , but most unemployed live in Alabama ) , technological ( skilled workers are replaced by machines , as in the auto industry ) , or can result from any sudden change in the types of jobs people are seeking versus the types of companies that are hiring .	0	sociology
 5610 . In 1893 , Émile Durkheim described what he called “ mechanical ” and “ organic ” solidarity that correlates to a society ’s economy .	0	sociology
 Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .	1	sociology
 Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .	1	sociology
 5613 . To solve this problem , people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at any time : that is , money .	0	sociology
 Money refers to an object that a society agrees to assign a value to so it can be exchanged for payment .	1	sociology
 In early economies , money was often objects like cowry shells , rice , barley , or even rum .	0	sociology
 5616 . Scholars do n’t always agree on a single definition of capitalism .	0	sociology
 For our purposes , we will define capitalism as an economic system in which there is private ownership ( as opposed to state ownership ) and where there is an impetus to produce profit , and thereby wealth .	1	sociology
 This is the type of economy in place in the United States today .	0	sociology
 5619 . By this he meant that if an owner did not work to produce or earn the property , then the owner was stealing it from those who did .	0	sociology
 Proudhon believed economies could work using a principle called mutualism , under which individuals and cooperative groups would exchange products with one another on the basis of mutually satisfactory contracts ( Proudhon 1840).By far the most important influential thinker on socialism is Karl Marx .	1	sociology
 Through his own writings and those with his collaborator , industrialist Friedrich Engels , Marx used a scientific analytical process to show that throughout history , the resolution of class struggles caused changes in economies .	0	sociology
 5622 . The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .	0	sociology
 In reality , to control the risk of an economic depression ( a sustained recession across several economic sectors ) , the U.S. government will often adjust interest rates to encourage more lending — and consequently more spending .	1	sociology
 In short , letting the natural cycle fluctuate is not a gamble most governments are willing to take .	0	sociology
 5625 . Factors that define stratification vary in different societies .	0	sociology
 In most societies , stratification is an economic system , based on wealth , the net value of money and assets a person has , and income , a person ’s wages or investment dividends .	1	sociology
 While people are regularly categorized based on how rich or poor they are , other important factors influence social standing .	0	sociology
 5628 . A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement .	1	sociology
 A class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and occupation .	1	sociology
 Unlike caste systems , class systems are open .	0	sociology
 5631 . MeritocracyMeritocracy is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort — or merit — that determines social standing .	1	sociology
 High levels of effort will lead to a high social position , and vice versa .	0	sociology
 5634 . In the last century , the United States has seen a steady rise in its standard of living , the level of wealth available to a certain socioeconomic class in order to acquire the material necessities and comforts to maintain its lifestyle .	1	sociology
 The standard of living is based on factors such as income , employment , class , poverty rates , and housing affordability .	0	sociology
 5637 . In the United States , people who earn a college degree , get a job promotion , or marry someone with a good income may move up socially .	0	sociology
 In contrast , downward mobility indicates a lowering of one ’s social class .	1	sociology
 Some people move downward because of business setbacks , unemployment , or illness .	0	sociology
 5640 . Patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long - term societal changes . Similarly , intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person 's social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime .	1	sociology
 For example , the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings . Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder .	1	sociology
 Structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole , not individual changes .	0	sociology
 5643 . In 1945 , sociologists Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore published the Davis - Moore thesis , which argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role , the greater must be the reward .	0	sociology
 The theory posits that social stratification represents the inherently unequal value of different work .	1	sociology
 5646 . In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .	0	sociology
 The GINI coefficient measures income inequality between countries using a 100-point scale on which 1 represents complete equality and 100 represents the highest possible inequality .	1	sociology
 In 2007 , the global GINI coefficient that measured the wealth gap between the core nations in the northern part of the world and the mostly peripheral nations in the southern part of the world was 75.5 percent ( Korseniewicz and Moran 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 5649 . When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .	0	sociology
 The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .	1	sociology
 The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .	1	sociology
 5652 . Those that were in a state of subordination faced significant obstacles to mobilization .	0	sociology
 Core nations are dominant capitalist countries , highly industrialized , technological , and urbanized .	1	sociology
 For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .	0	sociology
 5655 . The OECD ( Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development ) countries make up a group of thirty - four nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and sustainability .	0	sociology
 According to the World Bank ( 2014b ) , in 2013 , the average gross national income ( GNI ) per capita , or the mean income of the people in a nation , found by dividing total GNI by the total population , of a high - income nation belonging to the OECD was $ 43,903 per capita and the total population was over one billion ( 1.045 billion ) ; on average , 81 percent of the population in these nations was urban .	0	sociology
 Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b).High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .	0	sociology
 5658 . Perhaps the most pressing issue for middle - income nations is the problem of debt accumulation .	0	sociology
 As the name suggests , debt accumulation is the buildup of external debt , wherein countries borrow money from other nations to fund their expansion or growth goals .	1	sociology
 As the uncertainties of the global economy make repaying these debts , or even paying the interest on them , more challenging , nations can find themselves in trouble .	0	sociology
 5661 . Subjective poverty describes poverty that is composed of many dimensions ; it is subjectively present when your actual income does not meet your expectations and perceptions .	1	sociology
 With the concept of subjective poverty , the poor themselves have a greater say in recognizing when it is present .	0	sociology
 5664 . Child slavery , which may include child prostitution , is a form of chattel slavery .	0	sociology
 In debt bondage , or bonded labor , the poor pledge themselves as servants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like transportation , room , and board .	1	sociology
 In this scenario , people are paid less than they are charged for room and board .	0	sociology
 5667 . According to Zimmerman , Martin attacked him , and in the ensuing scuffle Martin was shot and killed ( CNN Library 2014).A public outcry followed Martin ’s death .	0	sociology
 There were allegations of racial profiling — the use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to stop and detain someone — a national discussion about “ Stand Your Ground Laws , ” and a failed lawsuit in which Zimmerman accused NBC of airing an edited version of the 911 call that made him appear racist .	1	sociology
 Zimmerman was not arrested until April 11 , when he was charged with second - degree murder by special prosecutor Angela Corey .	0	sociology
 5670 . Sociologist Louis Wirth ( 1945 ) defined a minority group as “ any group of people who , because of their physical or cultural characteristics , are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment , and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination . ” The term minority connotes discrimination , and in its sociological use , the term subordinate group can be used interchangeably with the term minority , while the term dominant group is often substituted for the group that ’s in the majority .	1	sociology
 These definitions correlate to the concept that the dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society , while subordinate groups are those who lack power compared to the dominant group .	1	sociology
 5673 . Prejudice refers to the beliefs , thoughts , feelings , and attitudes someone holds about a group .	1	sociology
 A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .	0	sociology
 5676 . For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .	0	sociology
 Colorism is another kind of prejudice , in which someone believes one type of skin tone is superior or inferior to another within a racial group .	1	sociology
 Studies suggest that darker skinned African Americans experience more discrimination than lighter skinned African Americans ( Herring , Keith , and Horton 2004 ; Klonoff and Landrine 2000 ) .	0	sociology
 5679 . Institutional discrimination can also include the promotion of a group 's status , such in the case of white privilege , which is the benefits people receive simply by being part of the dominant group . While most white people are willing to admit that nonwhite people live with a set of disadvantages due to the color of their skin , very few are willing to acknowledge the benefits they receive . Racial Tensions in the United States The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson , MO on August 9 , 2014 illustrates racial tensions in the United States as well as the overlap between prejudice , discrimination , and institutional racism .	1	sociology
 On that day , Brown , a young unarmed black man , was killed by a white police officer named Darren Wilson .	0	sociology
 5682 . For example , Vivien Thomas ( 1910–1985 ) , the black surgical technician who helped develop the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of “ blue babies ” was classified as a janitor for many years , and paid as such , despite the fact that he was conducting complicated surgical experiments .	0	sociology
 The years since the Civil War have showed a pattern of attempted disenfranchisement , with gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly minority neighborhoods . Feminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins ( 1990 ) developed intersection theory , which suggests we can not separate the effects of race , class , gender , sexual orientation , and other attributes .	1	sociology
 When we examine race and how it can bring us both advantages and disadvantages , it is important to acknowledge that the way we experience race is shaped , for example , by our gender and class .	0	sociology
 5685 . Expulsion refers to a subordinate group being forced , by a dominant group , to leave a certain area or country .	1	sociology
 As seen in the examples of the Trail of Tears and the Holocaust , expulsion can be a factor in genocide .	0	sociology
 5688 . Assimilation describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives up its own identity by taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture .	1	sociology
 In the United States , which has a history of welcoming and absorbing immigrants from different lands , assimilation has been a function of immigration .	0	sociology
 5691 . However , sociologists and most other social scientists view them as conceptually distinct .	0	sociology
 Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity . Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male . A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .	1	sociology
 5694 . Heterosexuals and homosexuals may also be referred to informally as “ straight ” and “ gay , ” respectively .	0	sociology
 The United States is a heteronormative society , meaning it assumes sexual orientation is biologically determined and unambiguous .	1	sociology
 Consider that homosexuals are often asked , “ When did you know you were gay ? ” but heterosexuals are rarely asked , “ When did you know that you were straight ? ” ( Ryle 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 5697 . In this socialization process , children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex .	0	sociology
 The term gender role refers to society ’s concept of how men and women are expected to look and how they should behave .	1	sociology
 These roles are based on norms , or standards , created by society .	0	sociology
 5700 . However , it is estimated that two to five percent of the U.S. population is transgender ( Transgender Law and Policy Institute 2007 ) .	0	sociology
 Transgender individuals who attempt to alter their bodies through medical interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy — so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity — are called transsexuals .	1	sociology
 They may also be known as male - to - female ( MTF ) or female - to - male ( FTM ) .	0	sociology
 5703 . Furthermore , the word gay ( as it refers to a homosexual ) , carried a somewhat negative and unfavorable meaning fifty years ago , but it has since gained more neutral and even positive connotations .	1	sociology
 When people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role assigned to them , they are said to be doing gender .	1	sociology
 This notion is based on the work of West and Zimmerman ( 1987 ) .	0	sociology
 5706 . Sexual Attitudes and PracticesIn the area of sexuality , sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices , not on physiology or anatomy .	0	sociology
 Sexuality is viewed as a person ’s capacity for sexual feelings .	1	sociology
 Studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal .	0	sociology
 5709 . The Gerontology Research Group ( 2014 ) estimates there are between 300 and 450 people worldwide who are at least 110 years of age .	0	sociology
 Centenarians are people living to be 100 years old , and they are approximately 1,000 times more common than supercentenarians .	1	sociology
 In 2010 , there were about 80,000 centenarians in the United States alone .	0	sociology
 5712 . This median age has been increasing , which indicates the population as a whole is growing older .	0	sociology
 A cohort is a group of people who share a statistical or demographic trait .	1	sociology
 People belonging to the same age cohort were born in the same time frame .	0	sociology
 5715 . From 1950 to approximately 2010 , the global population of individuals age sixty - five and older increased by a range of 5–7 percent ( Lee 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 This percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge impact on the dependency ratio : the number of nonproductive citizens ( young , disabled , or elderly ) to productive working citizens ( Bartram and Roe 2005 ) .	1	sociology
 One country that will soon face a serious aging crisis is China , which is on the cusp of an “ aging boom”— a period when its elderly population will dramatically increase .	1	sociology
 5718 . Dr. Ignatz Nascher and the Birth of GeriatricsIn the early 1900s , a New York physician named Dr. Ignatz Nascher coined the term geriatrics , a medical specialty that focuses on the elderly .	1	sociology
 He created the word by combining two Greek words : geron ( old man ) and iatrikos ( medical treatment ) .	0	sociology
 5721 . It broke new ground and opened the doors for sociologists , social workers , health practitioners , and therapists to study death and help those who were facing death .	0	sociology
 Kübler - Ross ’s work is generally considered a major contribution to thanatology : the systematic study of death and dying .	1	sociology
 5724 . The loss of independence is one potential part of the process , as are diminished physical ability and age discrimination .	0	sociology
 The term senescence refers to the aging process , including biological , emotional , intellectual , social , and spiritual changes .	1	sociology
 This section discusses some of the challenges we encounter during this process .	0	sociology
 5727 . This makes the care - providing situation more complex .	0	sociology
 Elder abuse occurs when a caretaker intentionally deprives an older person of care or harms the person in his or her charge .	1	sociology
 Caregivers may be family members , relatives , friends , health professionals , or employees of senior housing or nursing care .	0	sociology
 5730 . According to continuity theory , the elderly make specific choices to maintain consistency in internal ( personality structure , beliefs ) and external structures ( relationships ) , remaining active and involved throughout their elder years .	1	sociology
 This is an attempt to maintain social equilibrium and stability by making future decisions on the basis of already developed social roles ( Atchley 1971 ; Atchley 1989 ) .	0	sociology
 5733 . Finally , exchange theory ( Dowd 1975 ) , a rational choice approach , suggests we experience an increased dependence as we age and must increasingly submit to the will of others because we have fewer ways of compelling others to submit to us .	1	sociology
 Indeed , inasmuch as relationships are based on mutual exchanges , as the elderly become less able to exchange resources , they will see their social circles diminish .	0	sociology
 5751 . In many cultures , newly married couples move in with , or near to , family members .	0	sociology
 In a patrilocal residence system it is customary for the wife to live with ( or near ) her husband ’s blood relatives ( or family or orientation ) .	1	sociology
 Patrilocal systems can be traced back thousands of years .	0	sociology
 5757 . It is often characterized as violence between household or family members , specifically spouses .	1	sociology
 To include unmarried , cohabitating , and same - sex couples , family sociologists have created the term intimate partner violence ( IPV ) .	0	sociology
 Women are the primary victims of intimate partner violence .	0	sociology
 5760 . These universals , and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion , provide rich material for sociological study . In studying religion , sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience , beliefs , and rituals of a religion .	0	sociology
 Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .	1	sociology
 Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .	1	sociology
 5763 . For example , Christianity began as a cult , transformed into a sect , and today exists as an ecclesia .	0	sociology
 Cults , like sects , are new religious groups .	0	sociology
 In the United States today this term often carries pejorative connotations .	0	sociology
 5769 . For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .	1	sociology
 Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .	1	sociology
 Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .	1	sociology
 5772 . Liberation theology began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in the 1950s and 1960s in Latin America , and it combines Christian principles with political activism .	1	sociology
 It uses the church to promote social change via the political arena , and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice , discrimination , and poverty .	0	sociology
 5775 . Formal education describes the learning of academic facts and concepts through a formal curriculum .	1	sociology
 Arising from the tutelage of ancient Greek thinkers , centuries of scholars have examined topics through formalized methods of learning .	0	sociology
 5778 . Another global concern in education is universal access .	0	sociology
 This term refers to people ’s equal ability to participate in an education system .	1	sociology
 5781 . Such a situation leads to social class reproduction , extensively studied by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu .	0	sociology
 He researched how cultural capital , or cultural knowledge that serves ( metaphorically ) as currency that helps us navigate a culture , alters the experiences and opportunities available to French students from different social classes .	1	sociology
 Members of the upper and middle classes have more cultural capital than do families of lower - class status .	0	sociology
 5787 . In 2001 , the Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind Act , which requires states to test students in designated grades .	1	sociology
 The results of those tests determine eligibility to receive federal funding .	0	sociology
 5790 . According to Weber , the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been the case ; its legitimacy exists because it has been accepted for a long time .	0	sociology
 Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth , for instance , occupies a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of succession for the monarchy .	0	sociology
 5793 . According to Weber , power made legitimate by laws , written rules , and regulations is termed rational - legal authority .	1	sociology
 In this type of authority , power is vested in a particular rationale , system , or ideology and not necessarily in the person who implements the specifics of that doctrine .	0	sociology
 5796 . As mentioned above , the monarchies of most modern nations are ceremonial remnants of tradition , and individuals who hold titles in such sovereignties are often aristocratic figureheads . A few nations today , however , are run by governments wherein a monarch has absolute or unmitigated power .	1	sociology
 Such nations are called absolute monarchies .	0	sociology
 Although governments and regimes are constantly changing across the global landscape , it is generally safe to say that most modern absolute monarchies are concentrated in the Middle East and Africa .	0	sociology
 5799 . Power in a dictatorship is held by a single person ( or a very small group ) that wields complete and absolute authority over a government and population .	0	sociology
 Like some absolute monarchies , dictatorships may be corrupt and seek to limit or even eradicate the liberties of the general population .	1	sociology
 5802 . Thus , the United States is a constitution - based federal republic in which citizens elect representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf .	1	sociology
 The term representative democracy , which is virtually synonymous with republic , can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect representatives to promote policies that favor their interests .	1	sociology
 In the United States , representatives are elected at local and state levels , and the votes of the Electoral College determine who will hold the office of president .	0	sociology
 2116 . During the Middle Ages , most Europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord , a church , and simple homes for the peasants or serfs , who made up about 60 percent of western Europe ’s population .	0	history
 Hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over Europe ( [ link]).One of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is Carcassonne , France .	0	history
 2119 . During this period , the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe . Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons , village and family life revolved around the Church .	0	history
 The sacraments , or special ceremonies of the Church , marked every stage of life , from birth to maturation , marriage , and burial , and brought people into the church on a regular basis .	1	history
 As Christianity spread throughout Europe , it replaced pagan and animistic views , explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms .	0	history
 2122 . By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .	1	history
 This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .	1	history
 2131 . The Inca had no system of writing , however .	0	history
 They communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the quipu ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 2140 . Everywhere in the Americas , a crushing demand for labor bedeviled Europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going .	0	history
 Spain granted encomiendas — legal rights to native labor — to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown .	1	history

 2389 . One example of the violence that bubbled up was the infamous Fence Cutting War in Clay County , Texas ( 1883–1884 ) .	0	history
 There , cowboys began destroying fences that several ranchers erected along public lands : land they had no right to enclose .	0	history
 2392 . A more effective means with which to address the public perception of the “ Indian threat ” was needed .	0	history
 Americanization provided the answer .	0	history
 2395 . Although Thomas Alva Edison ( [ link ] ) is best known for his contributions to the electrical industry , his experimentation went far beyond the light bulb .	0	history
 Edison was quite possibly the greatest inventor of the turn of the century , saying famously that he “ hoped to have a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every month or so . ” He registered 1,093 patents over his lifetime and ran a world - famous laboratory , Menlo Park , which housed a rotating group of up to twenty - five scientists from around the globe .	0	history
 2398 . Rockefeller was ruthless in his pursuit of total control of the oil refining business .	0	history
 As other entrepreneurs flooded the area seeking a quick fortune , Rockefeller developed a plan to crush his competitors and create a true monopoly in the refining industry .	0	history
 Beginning in 1872 , he forged agreements with several large railroad companies to obtain discounted freight rates for shipping his product .	0	history
 2401 . In order to control the variety of interests he now maintained in industry , Rockefeller created a new legal entity , known as a trust .	0	history
 In this arrangement , a small group of trustees possess legal ownership of a business that they operate for the benefit of other investors .	1	history
 2404 . In the 1870s , Irish coal miners in eastern Pennsylvania formed a secret organization known as the Molly Maguires , named for the famous Irish patriot .	1	history
 Through a series of scare tactics that included kidnappings , beatings , and even murder , the Molly Maguires sought to bring attention to the miners’ plight , as well as to cause enough damage and concern to the mine owners that the owners would pay attention to their concerns .	0	history
 2407 . Churches and civic organizations provided some relief to the challenges of working - class city life .	0	history
 Churches were moved to intervene through their belief in the concept of the social gospel .	0	history
 This philosophy stated that all Christians , whether they were church leaders or social reformers , should be as concerned about the conditions of life in the secular world as the afterlife , and the Reverend Washington Gladden was a major advocate .	1	history
 2410 . One example of a machine political system was the Democratic political machine Tammany Hall in New York , run by machine boss William Tweed with assistance from George Washington Plunkitt ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 There , citizens knew their immediate problems would be addressed in return for their promise of political support in future elections .	0	history
 2413 . While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of funds to find anyplace better , and the wealthy class chose to remain in the cities to stay close to the action of big business transactions , the emerging middle class responded to urban challenges with their own solutions .	0	history
 This group included the managers , salesmen , engineers , doctors , accountants , and other salaried professionals who still worked for a living , but were significantly better educated and compensated than the working - class poor .	0	history
 2418 . These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .	0	history
 Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models .	1	history
 Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James .	0	history
 2424 . Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control the president .	0	history
 The first was Roscoe Conkling , Republican senator from New York and leader of the Stalwarts , a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Long supporting former President Grant , Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes’ early appeals for civil service reform .	0	history
 2427 . Unable to find such a man , the predominant Half - Breeds again turned to their own leader , Senator Blaine .	0	history
 However , when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface , a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional Stalwarts - versus - Half - Breeds debate and form their own faction , the Mugwumps , a name taken from the Algonquin phrase for “ great chief . ”	0	history
 2430 . The Farmers’ Alliance , a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid-1880s , took root in the wake of the Grange movement .	1	history
 In 1890 , Dr. Charles Macune , who led the Southern Alliance , which was based in Texas and had over 100,000 members by 1886 , urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization , the Northwest Alliance , and the Colored Alliance , the largest African American organization in the United States .	1	history
 2433 . A notable example of the government ’s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’s Army .	0	history
 In the spring of 1894 , businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington , DC , where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects .	1	history
 2436 . It was not until Theodore Roosevelt unexpectedly became president in 1901 that the federal government would engage in Progressive reforms .	0	history
 Before then , Progressivism was work done by the people , for the people .	0	history
 What knit Progressives together was the feeling that the country was moving at a dangerous pace in a dangerous direction and required the efforts of everyday Americans to help put it back on track .	0	history
 2439 . Another series of reforms pushed forward by Progressives that sought to sidestep the power of special interests in state legislatures and restore the democratic political process were three election innovations — the initiative , referendum , and recall .	0	history
 The first permitted voters to enact legislation by petitioning to place an idea , or initiative , on the ballot .	1	history
 2442 . The image below ( [ link ] ) shows a machinist in a factory where Taylor had consulted ; he is alone and focused solely on his job .	0	history
 Progressive in its emphasis on efficiency , the use of science , and the reliance on experts , Taylorism , as scientific management became known , was not widely popular among workers who resented managerial authority and the loss of autonomy over their work .	1	history
 Many workers went on strikes in response , although some favored Taylor ’s methods , since their pay was directly linked to the productivity increases that his methods achieved and since increased efficiency allowed companies to charge consumers lower prices .	0	history
 2445 . White middle - class reformers were appalled at the violence of race relations in the nation but typically shared the belief in racial characteristics and the superiority of Anglo - Saxon whites over African Americans , Asians , “ ethnic ” Europeans , Indians , and Latin American populations .	0	history
 Southern reformers considered segregation a Progressive solution to racial violence ; across the nation , educated middle - class Americans enthusiastically followed the work of eugenicists who identified virtually all human behavior as inheritable traits and issued awards at county fairs to families and individuals for their “ racial fitness . ” It was against this tide that African American leaders developed their own voice in the Progressive Era , working along diverse paths to improve the lives and conditions of African Americans throughout the country .	0	history
 2448 . By 1908 , internal fights over the role of women in the fight for African American equal rights lessened the interest in the Niagara Movement .	0	history
 But the movement laid the groundwork for the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , founded in 1909 .	0	history
 Du Bois served as the influential director of publications for the NAACP from its inception until 1933 .	0	history
 2451 . Although not as flamboyant or outwardly progressive as Roosevelt , Taft ’s organizational skills and generally solid performance as president aligned with the party leadership ’s concerns over another Roosevelt presidency and secured for him the Republican Party ’s nomination .	0	history
 Angry over this snub , in 1912 , Roosevelt and the other Progressive Republicans bolted from the Republican Party and formed the Progressive Party .	0	history
 His popularity had him hoping to win the presidential race as a third - party candidate .	0	history
 2454 . Fearing future loss of the territory through military conflict , as well as desiring to create challenges for Great Britain ( which they had fought in the Crimean War ) , Russia had happily accepted the American purchase offer .	0	history
 In the United States , several newspaper editors openly questioned the purchase and labeled it “ Seward ’s Folly ” ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 They highlighted the lack of Americans to populate the vast region and lamented the challenges in attempting to govern the native peoples in that territory .	0	history
 2457 . Shippers and other businessmen , particularly in the sugar industry , supported American intervention to safeguard their own interests in the region .	0	history
 Likewise , the “ Cuba Libre ” movement founded by José Martí , who quickly established offices in New York and Florida , further stirred American interest in the liberation cause .	0	history
 The difference in this uprising , however , was that supporters saw in the renewed U.S. Navy a force that could be a strong ally for Cuba .	0	history
 2460 . Domestically , the country was neither unified in their support of the treaty nor in the idea of the United States building an empire at all .	0	history
 Many prominent Americans , including Jane Addams , former President Grover Cleveland , Andrew Carnegie , Mark Twain , and Samuel Gompers , felt strongly that the country should not be pursuing an empire , and , in 1898 , they formed the Anti - Imperialist League to oppose this expansionism .	1	history
 The reasons for their opposition were varied : Some felt that empire building went against the principles of democracy and freedom upon which the country was founded , some worried about competition from foreign workers , and some held the xenophobic viewpoint that the assimilation of other races would hurt the country .	0	history
 2466 . Carranza refused to work with Wilson and the U.S. government , and instead threatened to defend Mexico ’s mineral rights against all American oil companies established there .	0	history
 Wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed Carranza , most notably Pancho Villa ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 However , Villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake Carranza ; in 1915 , Wilson reluctantly authorized official U.S. recognition of Carranza ’s government .	0	history
 2469 . The war effort was costly — with an eventual price tag in excess of $ 32 billion by 1920—and the government needed to finance it .	0	history
 The Liberty Loan Act allowed the federal government to sell liberty bonds to the American public , extolling citizens to “ do their part ” to help the war effort and bring the troops home .	1	history
 The government ultimately raised $ 23 billion through liberty bonds .	0	history
 2472 . First during World War I , then again in World War II , these women stepped up to run farms and other agricultural enterprises , as men left for the armed forces ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Known as Farmerettes , some twenty thousand women — mostly college educated and from larger urban areas — served in this capacity .	0	history
 Their reasons for joining were manifold .	0	history
 2475 . As early as January 1918—a full five months before U.S. military forces fired their first shot in the war , and eleven months before the actual armistice — Wilson announced his postwar peace plan before a joint session of Congress .	0	history
 Referring to what became known as the Fourteen Points , Wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade , specifically , free trade , freedom of the seas , an end to secret treaties and negotiations , promotion of self - determination of all nations , and more .	1	history
 In addition , he called for the creation of a League of Nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war .	0	history
 2478 . Meanwhile , southern lynchings continued to escalate , with white mobs burning African Americans at the stake .	0	history
 During the “ Red Summer ” of 1919 , northern cities recorded twenty - five bloody race riots that killed over 250 people .	1	history
 Among these was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 , where a white mob stoned a young black boy to death because he swam too close to the “ white beach ” on Lake Michigan .	1	history
 2481 . The 1920s opened up new possibilities of mobility for a large percentage of the U.S. population , as automobile manufacturers began to mass produce what had once been a luxury item , and daring aviators both demonstrated and drove advancements in aircraft technology .	0	history
 The most significant innovation of this era was Henry Ford ’s Model T Ford , which made car ownership available to the average American .	0	history
 2484 . Many of these new immigrants were coming from eastern and southern Europe and , for many English - speaking , native - born Americans of northern European descent , the growing diversity of new languages , customs , and religions triggered anxiety and racial animosity .	0	history
 In reaction , some embraced nativism , prizing white Americans with older family trees over more recent immigrants , and rejecting outside influences in favor of their own local customs .	1	history
 Nativists also stoked a sense of fear over the perceived foreign threat , pointing to the anarchist assassinations of the Spanish prime minister in 1897 , the Italian king in 1900 , and even President William McKinley in 1901 as proof .	0	history
 2487 . Many Americans were disillusioned in the post - World War I era , and their reactions took many forms .	0	history
 Rebellious American youth , in particular , adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents .	0	history
 Many young women of the era shed their mother ’s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper , the Jazz Age female stereotype , seeking the endless party .	1	history
 2490 . The law proved difficult to enforce , as illegal alcohol soon poured in from Canada and the Caribbean , and rural Americans resorted to home - brewed “ moonshine . ” The result was an eroding of respect for law and order , as many people continued to drink illegal liquor .	0	history
 Rather than bringing about an age of sobriety , as Progressive reformers had hoped , it gave rise to a new subculture that included illegal importers , interstate smuggling ( or bootlegging ) , clandestine saloons referred to as “ speakeasies , ” hipflasks , cocktail parties , and the organized crime of trafficking liquor .	1	history
 2493 . Although his critics depicted him as weak , lazy , or incompetent , he was actually quite shrewd and politically astute .	0	history
 Together with his running mate , Calvin Coolidge , the governor of Massachusetts , they attracted the votes of many Americans who sought Harding ’s promised return to normalcy .	0	history
 In the election , Harding defeated Governor James Cox of Ohio by the greatest majority in the history of two - party politics : 61 percent of the popular vote .	0	history
 2499 . Investors , along with the general public , withdrew their money from banks by the thousands , fearing the banks would go under .	0	history
 The more people pulled out their money in bank runs , the closer the banks came to insolvency ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2502 . In 1932 , a major strike at the Ford Motor Company factory near Detroit resulted in over sixty injuries and four deaths .	0	history
 Often referred to as the Ford Hunger March , the event unfolded as a planned demonstration among unemployed Ford workers who , to protest their desperate situation , marched nine miles from Detroit to the company ’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn .	1	history
 At the Dearborn city limits , local police launched tear gas at the roughly three thousand protestors , who responded by throwing stones and clods of dirt .	0	history
 2508 . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’s “ Good Neighbor ” policy .	0	history
 After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930—which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America .	1	history
 To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U.S. pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs .	1	history
 2511 . The election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signaled both immediate relief for the American public as well as a permanent shift in the role of the federal government in guiding the economy and providing direct assistance to the people , albeit through expensive programs that made extensive budget deficits commonplace .	0	history
 For many , the immediate relief was , at a minimum , psychological : Herbert Hoover was gone , and the situation could not grow worse under Roosevelt .	0	history
 2514 . After the landslide election , the country — and Hoover — had to endure the interregnum , the difficult four months between the election and President Roosevelt ’s inauguration in March 1933 .	1	history
 Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’s choosing .	0	history
 2520 . At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects .	0	history
 Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) .	0	history
 The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty - four who came from relief families .	1	history
 2523 . Regionally , Roosevelt ’s work was most famously seen in the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) ( [ link ] ) , a federal agency tasked with the job of planning and developing the area through flood control , reforestation , and hydroelectric power .	1	history
 Employing several thousand Americans on a project that Roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment , the TVA revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over - farmed , leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming .	0	history
 2526 . The Banking Act of 1935 was the most far - reaching revision of banking laws since the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 .	1	history
 Previously , regional reserve banks , particularly the New York Reserve Bank — controlled by the powerful Morgan and Rockefeller families — had dominated policy - making at the Federal Reserve .	0	history
 2529 . Roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation , doing so with the Wagner Act .	0	history
 The act created the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to once again protect American workers’ right to unionize and bargain collectively , as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard .	1	history
 Although roundly criticized by the Republican Party and factory owners , the Wagner Act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937 .	0	history
 2532 . Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .	0	history
 One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( [ link ] ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’s Division of Negro Affairs .	0	history
 Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’s foremost African American advisors .	0	history
 2535 . At a conference in Munich later that year , Great Britain ’s prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , and France ’s prime minister , Édouard Daladier , agreed to the partial dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland ( a region with a sizable German population ) by German troops ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 This Munich Pact offered a policy of appeasement , in the hope that German expansionist appetites could be satisfied without war .	0	history
 But not long after the agreement , Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia as well .	0	history
 2538 . Both groups ended their opposition , however , at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , respectively .	0	history
 Nevertheless , during the war , some seventy - two thousand men registered as conscientious objectors ( COs ) , and fifty - two thousand were granted that status .	0	history
 Of that fifty - two thousand , some accepted noncombat roles in the military , whereas others accepted unpaid work in civilian work camps .	0	history
 2541 . After all , they argued , if the United States were going to denounce Germany and Japan for abusing human rights , the country should itself be as exemplary as possible .	0	history
 Indeed , CORE ’s actions were in keeping with the goals of the Double V campaign that was begun in 1942 by the Pittsburgh Courier , the largest African American newspaper at the time ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 The campaign called upon African Americans to accomplish the two “ Vs ” : victory over America ’s foreign enemies and victory over racism in the United States .	1	history
 2544 . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .	0	history
 Executive Order 9066 , signed by Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , gave the army power to remove people from “ military areas ” to prevent sabotage or espionage .	1	history
 The army then used this authority to relocate people of Japanese ancestry living along the Pacific coast of Washington , Oregon , and California , as well as in parts of Arizona , to internment camps in the American interior .	0	history
 2547 . The “ Bataan Death March , ” during which as many as 650 American and 10,000 Filipino prisoners of war died , intensified anti - Japanese feelings .	1	history
 Kamikaze attacks that took place towards the end of the war were regarded as proof of the irrationality of Japanese martial values and mindless loyalty to Emperor Hirohito .	0	history
 2550 . To counter Soviet influence in the developing world , Kennedy supported a variety of measures .	0	history
 One of these was the Alliance for Progress , which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism .	1	history
 Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid , and he founded the Peace Corps , which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia , Africa , and Latin America .	1	history
 2553 . The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .	0	history
 One component of flexible response was the Green Berets , a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency — the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations .	1	history
 Much of the Kennedy administration ’s new approach to defense , however , remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare , and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal .	0	history
 2556 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , color , national origin , and religion , also prohibited , in Title VII , discrimination on the basis of sex .	1	history
 Ironically , protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a Virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act ’s passage ; his reasoning seemed to be that , while a white man might accept that African Americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination , the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate .	0	history
 2562 . For Carmichael , Black Power was the power of African Americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white - dominated ones , an idea also espoused in the 1920s by political leader and orator Marcus Garvey .	1	history
 Like Garvey , Carmichael became an advocate of black separatism , arguing that African Americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves .	1	history
 In keeping with this philosophy , Carmichael expelled SNCC ’s white members .	0	history
 2565 . Besides demobilizing the armed forces and preparing for the homecoming of servicemen and women , he also had to guide the nation through the process of returning to a peacetime economy .	0	history
 To this end , he proposed an ambitious program of social legislation that included establishing a federal minimum wage , expanding Social Security and public housing , and prohibiting child labor .	0	history
 Wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others , like meat .	0	history
 2568 . In February 1946 , George Kennan , a State Department official stationed at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , sent an eight - thousand - word message to Washington , DC .	0	history
 In what became known as the “ Long Telegram , ” Kennan maintained that Soviet leaders believed that the only way to protect the Soviet Union was to destroy “ rival ” nations and their influence over weaker nations .	1	history
 According to Kennan , the Soviet Union was not so much a revolutionary regime as a totalitarian bureaucracy that was unable to accept the prospect of a peaceful coexistence of the United States and itself .	0	history
 2571 . Like dominos toppling one another , entire regions would eventually be controlled by the Soviets .	0	history
 The demand for anti - Communist containment appeared as early as March 1946 in a speech by Winston Churchill , in which he referred to an Iron Curtain that divided Europe into the “ free ” West and the Communist East controlled by the Soviet Union .	0	history
 2574 . Witnesses were subpoenaed and required to testify before the committee ; refusal could result in imprisonment .	0	history

 In 1956 , ninety - six members of Congress signed “ The Southern Manifesto , ” in which they accused the U.S. Supreme Court of misusing its power and violating the principle of states’ rights , which maintained that states had rights equal to those of the federal government .	1	history
 2589 . “ Hippies ” rejected the conventions of traditional society .	1	history
 Men sported beards and grew their hair long ; both men and women wore clothing from non - Western cultures , defied their parents , rejected social etiquettes and manners , and turned to music as an expression of their sense of self .	0	history
 2592 . Nixon also courted northern , blue - collar workers , whom he later called the silent majority , to acknowledge their belief that their voices were seldom heard .	1	history
 These voters feared the social changes taking place in the country : Antiwar protests challenged their own sense of patriotism and civic duty , whereas the recreational use of new drugs threatened their cherished principles of self - discipline , and urban riots invoked the specter of a racial reckoning .	0	history
 2595 . The combination of unemployment and rising prices posed an unfamiliar challenge to economists whose fiscal policies of either expanding or contracting federal spending could only address one side of the problem at the cost of the other .	1	history
 This phenomenon of “ stagflation”—a term that combined the economic conditions of stagnation and inflation — outlived the Nixon administration , enduring into the early 1980s .	0	history
 2598 . As the conflict wore on and reports of brutalities increased , the antiwar movement grew in strength .	0	history
 To take the political pressure off himself and his administration , and find a way to exit Vietnam “ with honor , ” Nixon began the process of Vietnamization , turning more responsibility for the war over to South Vietnamese forces by training them and providing American weaponry , while withdrawing U.S. troops from the field .	1	history
 At the same time , however , Nixon authorized the bombing of neighboring Cambodia , which had declared its neutrality , in an effort to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong bases within that country and cut off supply routes between North and South Vietnam .	0	history
 2601 . In the weeks following the Watergate break - in , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , reporters for The Washington Post , received information from several anonymous sources , including one known to them only as “ Deep Throat , ” that led them to realize the White House was deeply implicated in the break - in .	0	history
 As the press focused on other events , Woodward and Bernstein continued to dig and publish their findings , keeping the public ’s attention on the unfolding scandal .	0	history
 2604 . After two unsuccessful Republican primary bids in 1968 and 1976 , Reagan won the presidency in 1980 .	0	history
 His victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and the growth of the New Right .	0	history
 This group of conservative Americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s .	1	history
 2607 . Much of the intellectual meat of the Reagan Revolution came from conservative think tanks ( policy or advocacy groups ) that specifically sought to shape American political and social dialogues .	0	history
 The Heritage Foundation , one such group , soon became the intellectual arm of the conservative movement .	1	history
 2610 . Because the disease was seen almost exclusively in male homosexuals , it was quickly dubbed “ gay cancer . ” Doctors soon realized it often coincided with other symptoms , including a rare form of pneumonia , and they renamed it “ Gay Related Immune Deficiency ” ( GRID ) , although people other than gay men , primarily intravenous drug users , were dying from the disease as well .	0	history
 The connection between gay men and GRID — later renamed human immunodeficiency virus / autoimmune deficiency syndrome , or HIV / AIDS — led heterosexuals largely to ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community , wrongly assuming they were safe from its effects .	0	history
 The federal government also overlooked the disease , and calls for more money to research and find the cure were ignored .	0	history
 2613 . Reagan , however , overlooked the legitimate complaints of the Sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to Cuban and Soviet influence .	0	history
 A year into his presidency , convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of Soviet and Communist influence in Latin America , he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to equip and train a group of anti - Sandinista Nicaraguans known as the Contras ( contrarevolucionários or “ counter - revolutionaries ” ) to oust Ortega .	1	history
 2616 . Soon they were mounting fierce opposition to the bill .	0	history
 Moderate conservatives dubbed the reform proposals “ Hillarycare ” and argued that the bill was an unwarranted expansion of the powers of the federal government that would interfere with people ’s ability to choose the healthcare provider they wanted .	0	history
 Those further to the right argued that healthcare reform was part of a larger and nefarious plot to control the public .	0	history
 2619 . Lieberman had been quick to denounce Clinton ’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky .	0	history
 Consumer advocate Ralph Nader ran as the candidate of the Green Party , a party devoted to environmental issues and grassroots activism , and Democrats feared that he would attract votes that Gore might otherwise win .	1	history
 2622 . On September 20 , in an address to a joint session of Congress , Bush declared war on terrorism , blamed al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the attacks , and demanded that the radical Islamic fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan , the Taliban , turn bin Laden over or face attack by the United States .	1	history
 This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .	1	history
 2625 . Fearing that terrorists might strike within the nation ’s borders again , and aware of the chronic lack of cooperation among different federal law enforcement agencies , Bush created the Office of Homeland Security in October 2001 .	0	history
 The next year , Congress passed the Homeland Security Act , creating the Department of Homeland Security , which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home ( [ link ] ) . The Bush administration also pushed the USA Patriot Act through Congress , which enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor citizens’ e - mails and phone conversations without a warrant .	1	history
 2628 . In the end , no such weapons were ever found .	0	history
 These criticisms were amplified by growing international concern over the treatment of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and widespread disgust over the torture conducted by U.S. troops at the prison in Abu Ghraib , Iraq , which surfaced only months before the election ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2631 . Even though CDOs consisted of subprime mortgages , credit card debt , and other risky investments , credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe .	0	history
 Making matters worse , financial institutions created instruments called credit default swaps , which were essentially a form of insurance on investments .	1	history
 If the investment lost money , the investors would be compensated .	0	history
 2634 . This popular denial has had huge global consequences .	0	history
 In 1998 , the United States , which produces roughly 36 percent of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that prevent the earth ’s heat from escaping into space , signed the Kyoto Protocol , an agreement among the world ’s nations to reduce their emissions of these gases .	1	history
 President Bush objected to the requirement that major industrialized nations limit their emissions to a greater extent than other parts of the world and argued that doing so might hurt the American economy .	0	history
 909 . The single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the Gingko biloba ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Its fan - shaped leaves — unique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern — turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree .	1	biology
 912 . For example , the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical .	0	biology
 Petals , collectively the corolla , are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators .	1	biology
 Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .	0	biology
 915 . Flower structure is very diverse , and carpels may be singular , multiple , or fused .	0	biology
 Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil .	1	biology
 The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel .	0	biology
 918 . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .	1	biology
 Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .	0	biology
 924 . Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem ; in monocots , vascular tissue is scattered in the stem .	0	biology
 Eudicots can be herbaceous ( like grasses ) , or produce woody tissues .	0	biology
 Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate , with three furrows or pores .	1	biology
 927 . It is possible , for example , to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower ’s characteristics .	0	biology
 Many bird or insect - pollinated flowers secrete nectar , which is a sugary liquid .	1	biology
 They also produce both fertile pollen , for reproduction , and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects .	0	biology
 930 . Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .	0	biology
 Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .	1	biology
 936 . Male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube : an extension of a cell within the pollen grain .	1	biology
 The sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella , but in cycads and the Gingko , the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete ; however , they are enclosed in a pollen grain .	0	biology
 939 . Most animals reproduce sexually , and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan .	0	biology
 The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal , determined by developmental cues . All animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food .	1	biology
 The ( a ) black bear is an omnivore , eating both plants and animals .	0	biology
 942 . Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .	1	biology
 This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the gastrula , in which the future digestive cavity is formed .	1	biology
 Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .	0	biology
 945 . These genes that determine animal structure are called “ homeotic genes , ” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes .	1	biology
 The animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as Hox genes .	1	biology
 This family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan , such as the number of body segments of an animal , the number and placement of appendages , and animal head - tail directionality .	0	biology
 948 . The animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers , an inner layer ( endoderm ) and an outer layer ( ectoderm ) .	1	biology
 These animals are called diploblasts .	0	biology
 Diploblasts have a non - living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm .	0	biology
 954 . Bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development .	0	biology
 Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .	0	biology
 957 . Recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes , however , and the theory remains under debate . Another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation , beginning from the gastrula stage .	0	biology
 The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom .	1	biology
 Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely .	0	biology
 960 . This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage , where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis , resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles .	0	biology
 966 . The time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran period ( from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago ) , the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 It is believed that early animal life , termed Ediacaran biota , evolved from protists at this time .	1	biology
 969 . On the other hand , cataclysmic events , such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life , can result in devastating losses of diversity .	0	biology
 Such periods of mass extinction ( [ link ] ) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life , erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind .	0	biology
 The end of the Permian period ( and the Paleozoic Era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth ’s history , a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time .	0	biology
 972 . Morphology of SpongesThe morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity , the spongocoel , occupying the inside of the cylinder .	1	biology
 Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .	0	biology
 978 . The second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes ( or archaeocytes ) , named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba - like fashion .	1	biology
 Amoebocytes have a variety of functions : delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge , giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction ( which remain in the mesohyl ) , delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs , and differentiating into more - specific cell types .	0	biology
 981 . Phylum Cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic , that is , they develop from two embryonic layers . Nearly all ( about 99 percent ) cnidarians are marine species .	1	biology
 984 . Click here to follow the life cycle of the Obelia . All cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo .	1	biology
 The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .	0	biology
 Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .	0	biology
 987 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .	0	biology
 The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .	1	biology
 Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment , and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity .	0	biology
 990 . This is called protostomy or “ first mouth . ” In protostomy , solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells .	1	biology
 This layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom ; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom .	1	biology
 993 . The Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms .	1	biology
 Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine , predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers , with an estimated 900 species known .	0	biology
 However , nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well .	0	biology
 996 . The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .	0	biology
 In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .	0	biology
 This larval form , characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap , devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult - like morphology .	1	biology
 999 . Additionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .	1	biology
 The mantle ( also known as the pallium ) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks ; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell .	1	biology
 1005 . Phylum Annelida includes segmented worms .	0	biology
 These animals are found in marine , terrestrial , and freshwater habitats , but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival , especially in terrestrial habitats .	0	biology
 1008 . Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the epidermis .	0	biology
 Chitinous hairlike extensions , anchored in the epidermis and projecting from the cuticle , called setae / chaetae are present in every segment .	1	biology
 Annelids show the presence of a true coelom , derived from embryonic mesoderm and protostomy .	0	biology
 1011 . The name “ arthropoda ” means “ jointed legs ” ( in the Greek , “ arthros ” means “ joint ” and “ podos ” means “ leg ” ) ; it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum .	1	biology
 Arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented .	0	biology
 The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages .	0	biology
 1014 . Unlike that of the Hexapoda , the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax ( [ link ] ) , which is covered by a plate called the carapace , thus producing a body structure of two tagma .	0	biology
 Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size .	0	biology
 1017 . Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .	0	biology
 A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1020 . The second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps .	1	biology
 In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .	1	biology
 1023 . Phylum EchinodermataEchinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin ( from the Greek “ echinos ” meaning “ spiny ” and “ dermos ” meaning “ skin ” ) , and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species .	1	biology
 Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms .	0	biology
 Sea stars ( [ link ] ) , sea cucumbers , sea urchins , sand dollars , and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms .	0	biology
 1026 . Phylum ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail .	0	biology
 In some groups , some of these traits are present only during embryonic development .	0	biology
 1029 . The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development .	0	biology
 In chordates , it is located dorsal to the notochord .	0	biology
 1032 . The post - anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body , extending beyond the anus .	1	biology
 The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles , which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species , such as fishes .	0	biology
 1035 . Extant members of Cephalochordata are the lancelets , named for their blade - like shape .	1	biology
 Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas .	0	biology
 1038 . Vertebrates are members of the clade Vertebrata .	0	biology
 Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .	0	biology
 1041 . The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .	0	biology
 Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1044 . The clade Petromyzontidae includes approximately 35–40 or more species of lampreys .	0	biology
 Lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape ; however , lampreys possess some vertebral elements .	1	biology
 Lampreys lack paired appendages and bone , as do the hagfishes .	0	biology
 1047 . Sharks have well - developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey , including a keen sense of smell and electroreception , with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal .	0	biology
 Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things , including their prey .	1	biology
 Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .	0	biology
 1050 . Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective , muscular flap called the operculum .	0	biology
 Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .	1	biology
 Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .	1	biology
 1059 . An estimated 185 species comprise caecilians , a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda .	1	biology
 Although they are vertebrates , a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance .	0	biology
 1062 . The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration .	0	biology
 The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration .	0	biology
 In mammals , membranes that are homologous to the extra - embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta .	0	biology
 1065 . The key differences between the synapsids , anapsids , and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .	1	biology
 Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .	0	biology
 1077 . Mammalian integument , or skin , includes secretory glands with various functions .	1	biology
 Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication .	1	biology
 Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .	0	biology
 1080 . Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks .	1	biology
 Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns .	0	biology
 While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands , male marsupials do not .	0	biology
 1083 . Most mammals have heterodont teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth .	1	biology
 Most mammals are diphyodonts , meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime : deciduous or “ baby ” teeth , and permanent teeth .	1	biology
 Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts , that is , their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life .	1	biology
 1086 . Marsupials are found primarily in Australia , though the opossum is found in North America .	0	biology
 Australian marsupials include the kangaroo , koala , bandicoot , Tasmanian devil ( [ link ] ) , and several other species .	0	biology
 1089 . The feathers on a wing are flexible , so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them , reducing the drag on the wing .	1	biology
 Flight feathers are asymmetrical , which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .	0	biology
 1092 . Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .	1	biology
 They create a smooth , aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird ’s body , allowing for efficient flight .	0	biology
 1095 . Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long - necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus .	0	biology
 The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .	1	biology
 This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1098 . After the extinction of Enantiornithes , modern birds became the dominant bird , with a large radiation occurring during the Cenozoic Era .	0	biology
 Referred to as Neornithes ( “ new birds ” ) , modern birds are now classified into two groups , the Paleognathae ( “ old jaw ” ) or ratites , a group of flightless birds including ostriches , emus , rheas , and kiwis , and the Neognathae ( “ new jaw ” ) , which includes all other birds .	1	biology
 1104 . These proto - primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available .	0	biology
 The oldest known primate - like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is Plesiadapis ( although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a proto - primate ) .	1	biology
 Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago .	0	biology
 1116 . Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types : meristematic tissue , and permanent ( or non - meristematic ) tissue .	0	biology
 Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .	1	biology
 Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	0	biology
 1119 . Meristematic tissues consist of three types , based on their location in the plant .	0	biology
 Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .	1	biology
 Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 1122 . They differentiate into three main types : dermal , vascular , and ground tissue .	0	biology
 Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .	1	biology
 Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .	1	biology
 1125 . Plant stems , whether above or below ground , are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .	1	biology
 The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .	1	biology
 1128 . An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .	1	biology
 The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .	0	biology
 1131 . Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant , but unlike collenchyma cells , many of them are dead at maturity .	1	biology
 There are two types of sclerenchyma cells : fibers and sclereids .	0	biology
 1137 . The latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity .	0	biology
 Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified .	1	biology
 Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .	0	biology
 1140 . Although still alive at maturity , the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve - tube cells have disintegrated .	0	biology
 Companion cells are found alongside the sieve - tube cells , providing them with metabolic support .	1	biology
 The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve - tube cells , which lack some cellular organelles .	0	biology
 1146 . Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes .	1	biology
 Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .	0	biology
 1149 . Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .	1	biology
 Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp .	1	biology
 ) .	0	biology
 1152 . Some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .	1	biology
 Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .	1	biology
 1155 . Dicots have a tap root system , while monocots have a fibrous root system .	0	biology
 A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically , and from which many smaller lateral roots arise .	1	biology
 Dandelions are a good example ; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds , and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root ) .	0	biology
 1158 . The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption .	0	biology
 Root hairs , which are extensions of root epidermal cells , increase the surface area of the root , greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals .	1	biology
 1161 . A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells .	0	biology
 This waxy region , known as the Casparian strip , forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells .	1	biology
 This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .	0	biology
 1164 . Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .	1	biology
 Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 1167 . Within each leaf , the vascular tissue forms veins .	0	biology
 The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern .	1	biology
 Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1170 . Leaves may be simple or compound ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .	1	biology
 In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .	1	biology
 1173 . ( common name “ umbrella plant ” ) .	0	biology
 Pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather - like appearance ; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib , as in rose leaves ( Rosa sp .	0	biology
 ) , or the leaves of hickory , pecan , ash , or walnut trees .	0	biology
 1176 . In practical terms , therefore , water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water ( at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature ) .	1	biology
 Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter ψ ( psi ) and is expressed in units of pressure ( pressure is a form of energy ) called megapascals ( MPa ) .	0	biology
 The potential of pure water ( Ψwpure H2O ) is , by convenience of definition , designated a value of zero ( even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy , that energy is ignored ) .	0	biology
 1179 . Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water .	0	biology
 Regulation of transpiration , therefore , is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface .	0	biology
 1188 . The aptly - named phototropins are protein - based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response .	1	biology
 Like all plant photoreceptors , phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light - absorbing portion , called the chromophore .	0	biology
 1191 . Amyloplasts ( also known as statoliths ) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity .	1	biology
 Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap .	0	biology
 1194 . The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth .	0	biology
 The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin , a hormone that promotes cytokinesis ( cell division ) .	1	biology
 Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date .	0	biology
 1197 . Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening , flower wilting , and leaf fall .	0	biology
 Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas ( C2H4 ) .	0	biology
 1200 . They act locally at the site of injury , and can also be transported to other tissues .	0	biology
 Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins .	1	biology
 Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae , a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi .	1	biology
 1203 . Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect .	0	biology
 The released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves , which reopen for the next meal . Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress .	1	biology
 When trees bend in the wind , for example , growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens .	0	biology
 1206 . Plants require only light , water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs : these 20 elements are called essential nutrients ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 For an element to be regarded as essential , three criteria are required : 1 ) a plant can not complete its life cycle without the element ; 2 ) no other element can perform the function of the element ; and 3 ) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition .	0	biology
 5223 . Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .	0	economic
 Farm subsidies in the high - income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce .	0	economic
 This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production .	0	economic
 5229 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .	0	economic
 After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .	0	economic
 5232 . However , Bhutanese politicians , business leaders , and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry .	0	economic
 Thus , the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time , to give the infant industry time to mature , before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy .	1	economic

 5235 . Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .	1	economic
 Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .	0	economic
 Anti - dumping complaints have risen in recent years , from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s .	0	economic
 5238 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .	0	economic
 In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .	0	economic
 The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury : as soon as their people have enough to eat , decent healthcare , and longer life expectancies , then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants , scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks , national parks to protect wildlife , and so on .	0	economic
 5241 . The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) was officially born in 1995 , but its history is much longer .	0	economic
 In the years after the Great Depression and World War II , there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together .	0	economic
 5244 . The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union .	0	economic
 In the years after World War II , leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely , they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war .	0	economic
 5247 . In other words , the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs ; indeed , the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change — a new technology — that causes real tradeoffs .	0	economic
 In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade , or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter , the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism , but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues , while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur .	0	economic
 5250 . The m term in the equation for the line is the slope .	0	economic
 Remember that slope is defined as rise over run ; more specifically , the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis .	0	economic
 In this example , each time the x term increases by one ( the run ) , the y term rises by three .	0	economic
 5256 . One common line graph is called a time series , in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable .	1	economic
 Thus , a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time .	0	economic
 5259 . Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people ’s preferences .	0	economic
 In Consumer Choices , the level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms .	0	economic
 This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .	0	economic
 5262 . Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .	0	economic
 Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same .	1	economic
 Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right .	0	economic
 5265 . A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right .	0	economic
 In graphical terms , the new budget constraint will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve , representing a higher level of utility .	0	economic
 A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left , which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve , representing a reduced level of utility .	0	economic
 5268 . The price of haircuts rises to $ 30 .	0	economic
 Ogden starts at choice A on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve .	0	economic
 After the price of pizza increases , he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve .	0	economic
 5271 . The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm .	0	economic
 The concept of a present discounted value ( PDV ) , which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments , can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds .	1	economic
 To place a present discounted value on a future payment , think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future .	0	economic
 5274 . The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion .	0	economic
 The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP .	0	economic
 Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD / AS diagrams : it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital . The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line , which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right .	1	economic
 5280 . [ link ] shows an investment function where the level of investment is , for the sake of concreteness , set at the specific level of 500 .	0	economic
 Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP ( or national income ) , the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP .	0	economic
 5283 . Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example , and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column .	0	economic
 The final column , aggregate expenditures , sums up C + I + G + X – M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	economic
 5286 . In this situation , the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level , and unemployment will occur .	0	economic
 The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap .	0	economic
 Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low , firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers , and unemployment will be high .	0	economic
 5289 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .	0	economic
 One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .	1	economic
 5292 . Remember , the demand curve traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities .	0	economic
 The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid , is called consumer surplus .	1	economic
 Consumer surplus is the area labeled F — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve . Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus , which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay .	0	economic
 5295 . First , an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced .	0	economic
 The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss .	1	economic
 In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one .	0	economic
 4617 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .	0	economic
 Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .	1	economic
 4620 . In the United States , the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person : Mollie Orshansky .	0	economic
 In 1963 , Orshansky , who was working for the Social Security Administration , published an article called “ Children of the Poor ” in a highly useful and dry - as - dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin .	0	economic
 4623 . As a result , the person experiences no net gain for working .	0	economic
 Economists call this problem the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4626 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor .	1	economic
 Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .	0	economic
 4629 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .	1	economic
 This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .	0	economic
 4632 . Often called “ food stamps , ” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is a federally funded program , started in 1964 , in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food .	1	economic
 The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income , number of children , and other factors but , in general , households are expected to spend about 30 % of their own net income on food , and if 30 % of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet , then those households are eligible for SNAP.SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4635 . Medicaid was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government .	1	economic
 The federal government helps fund Medicaid , but each state is responsible for administering the program , determining the level of benefits , and determining eligibility .	0	economic
 4638 . For example , you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution .	0	economic
 [ link ] presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a Lorenz curve .	0	economic
 The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4644 . Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that , even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools , each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests , desires , talents , and efforts .	0	economic
 Some of those initiatives include those shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4647 . A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .	1	economic
 Thus , negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining . The subject of labor unions can be controversial .	1	economic
 Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers’ primary line of defense against efforts by profit - seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits .	0	economic
 4650 . Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record - keeping and computer - operated cabs for loading and unloading ships — changes which the union opposed , along with overtime pay .	0	economic
 President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft - Hartley Act — where a court can impose an 80-day “ cooling - off period ” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage .	1	economic
 Federal mediators were called in , and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015 .	0	economic
 4653 . The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions .	0	economic
 The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor - Management Relations Act of 1935 , which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so .	1	economic
 The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all - out production efforts needed during World War II .	0	economic
 4656 . Investigating the Black / White Earnings GapBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century .	0	economic
 Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker , regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker .	0	economic
 Moreover , blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities , which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs .	0	economic
 4659 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .	1	economic
 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .	1	economic
 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .	1	economic
 4662 . Today , affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit .	0	economic
 This type of redress is enforced by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) .	0	economic
 4665 . In August 2009 , many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall - style meetings to discuss President Obama ’s proposed changes to the U.S. healthcare system .	1	economic
 This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) or as the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but was more popularly known as Obamacare .	0	economic
 The bill ’s opponents’ claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $ 750 billion to the deficit , to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so - called “ death panels ” that decide which critically - ill patients receive care and which do not .	0	economic
 4668 . Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .	1	economic
 Let ’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods , labor , and financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold .	0	economic
 4671 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .	1	economic
 By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .	1	economic
 When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating , markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price .	0	economic
 4674 . “ If only you knew more economics , you would not be so irrational , ” is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying .	0	economic
 A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion , because so much of this so - called “ quirky ” behavior is extremely common among us .	0	economic
 For example , a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $ 10 bill today , and also got an extra $ 10 in your paycheck , you should feel perfectly neutral .	0	economic
 4677 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .	1	economic
 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars , appliances and even houses .	0	economic
 4680 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 4683 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .	1	economic
 Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .	1	economic
 4686 . Unemployment insurance : Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance , which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time , usually six months , after they lose their jobs .	1	economic
 4689 . Workman ’s compensation insurance : Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds , typically run at the state level , that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job .	1	economic
 4692 . Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance .	1	economic
 For example , if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor , you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor ’s visit .	0	economic
 4695 . Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 For example , insurance might pay for 80 % of the costs of repairing a home after a fire , but the homeowner would pay the other 20 % .	0	economic
 4698 . Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high - risk or low - risk than the insurance company does .	1	economic
 This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high - risk tend to want to buy more insurance , without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk .	0	economic
 4701 . In March of 2010 , President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) .	0	economic
 This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013 .	0	economic
 4704 . Individuals can not , however , take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year , write a letter to General Motors or some other firm , and negotiate to invest their money with that firm .	0	economic
 Financial capital markets bridge this gap : that is , they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital .	1	economic
 Such financial markets include stocks , bonds , bank loans , and other financial investments .	0	economic
 4707 . They also provide advice on potential products , customers , and key employees .	0	economic
 Typically , a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms , and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs . The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year : as one example , venture capital firms invested more than $ 48.3 billion in 2014 , according to the National Venture Capital Association .	1	economic
 All early - stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big ; indeed , many of them will go out of business within a few months or years .	0	economic
 4710 . A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .	1	economic
 For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury .	1	economic
 4713 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .	0	economic
 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 4716 . First , a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public ( the public includes individuals , mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension funds ) .	0	economic
 A firm ’s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering ( IPO ) .	1	economic
 The IPO is important for two reasons .	0	economic
 4719 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .	1	economic
 A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .	1	economic

 Risk measures the uncertainty of that project ’s profitability .	1	economic
 There are several types of risk , including default risk and interest rate risk .	0	economic
 4728 . Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs .	0	economic
 A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 4731 . In part , this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer .	0	economic
 In addition , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) protects the savings of the average person .	1	economic
 Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC , based on the size of its deposits .	0	economic

 Bonds are bought not only when they are issued ; they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes .	0	economic
 4740 . An individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions .	0	economic
 Thus , a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification , which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies .	1	economic
 A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb : “ Do n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ” In any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse — but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value .	0	economic
 4743 . About two - thirds of U.S. households own their own home .	0	economic
 An owner ’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house .	0	economic
 For example , imagine that you buy a house for $ 200,000 , paying 10 % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ 180,000 .	0	economic

As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic
 4755 . The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high , while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower .	0	economic
 One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by AARP , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance .	0	economic
 4758 . For example , policies that impose price controls — like rent control — may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords .	0	economic
 However , when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area , a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available .	0	economic
 4761 . Democracy is sometimes summed up ( and oversimplified ) in two words : “ Majority rule . ” When voters face three or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers .	1	economic
 4764 . The situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B , Choice B is preferred by a majority over Choice C , and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A is called a voting cycle .	1	economic
 It is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur .	0	economic
 4767 . In April 2009 , the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking it to investigate tire imports from China .	0	economic
 Under U.S. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States , as determined by the ITC , then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption .	0	economic
 4770 . Who buys all of this production ?	0	economic
 This demand can be divided into four main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports .	1	economic
 ( See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment . )	0	economic
 4773 . The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports ( X ) minus the dollar value of imports ( M ) , ( X – M ) .	1	economic
 The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .	1	economic
 If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 4776 . Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades , even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 .	0	economic
 As noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total GDP .	0	economic
 4779 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .	0	economic
 Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .	1	economic
 4782 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .	1	economic
 The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .	1	economic
 4785 . Similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced .	0	economic
 The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .	1	economic
 The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .	1	economic
 4788 . [ link ] shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960 .	0	economic
 Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .	0	economic
 4791 . A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 4794 . Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle .	1	economic
 It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough - to - peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960 .	0	economic
 4797 . Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	1	economic
 Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) equivalent exchange rates .	0	economic
 Market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets .	1	economic
 4800 . One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that , as of 1970 , only about 42 % of women participated in the paid labor force .	0	economic
 By the second decade of the 2000s , nearly 60 % of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .	0	economic
 As women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy , which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed .	0	economic
 4803 . Before the last two centuries , although rulers , nobles , and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries . Progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .	0	economic
 According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .	0	economic

 4806 . Economic growth depends on many factors .	0	economic
 Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently .	0	economic
 Laws must be clear , public , fair , enforced , and equally applicable to all members of society .	0	economic
 4809 . The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change .	0	economic
 Technological change is a combination of invention — advances in knowledge — and innovation , which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service .	1	economic
 For example , the transistor was invented in 1947 .	0	economic
 4812 . While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 ( around 3 % ) , it has slowed down since then .	0	economic
 Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages .	0	economic
 Over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce .	0	economic
 4815 . The category of technology is the “ joker in the deck . ” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation .	0	economic
 When most people think of new technology , the invention of new products like the laser , the smartphone , or some new wonder drug come to mind .	0	economic

 The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker .	0	economic
 4821 . Some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence , in which their economies grow faster than those of high - income countries .	0	economic
 GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7 % per year in the 1990s and 2.3 % per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high - income countries of the world , which include the United States , Canada , the countries of the European Union , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .	0	economic

 The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital .	1	economic
 Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence .	0	economic
 4827 . There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed , though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be .	0	economic
 Additionally , there are individuals who are underemployed .	0	economic
 This includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills .	0	economic

 4833 . One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy .	0	economic
 If firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right .	0	economic
 4836 . In other words , these people are involuntarily unemployed .	0	economic
 What causes involuntary unemployment ?	0	economic
 4839 . One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract , which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble , and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong .	0	economic
 This wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times .	0	economic
 4842 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 4845 . In a market economy , some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that happened to make bad decisions ; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is desired ; a large customer who went broke ; or tough domestic or foreign competitors .	0	economic
 Conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees .	0	economic
 4848 . However , adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly .	0	economic
 Wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year .	0	economic
 In many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level .	0	economic
 4851 . Sure , the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive .	0	economic
 Sure , per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2014 , but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years ?	0	economic
 Not likely . A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand .	0	economic
 4854 . To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods .	0	economic
 Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 4857 . The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	0	economic
 In recent years , the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility .	0	economic
 4860 . As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending .	1	economic
 Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables .	1	economic
 In this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living .	0	economic
 4863 . There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	1	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 4866 . Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of 1920–1921 , the Great Depression , the recession of 1980–1982 , and the Great Recession in 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary , but not at an annual rate .	0	economic
 4869 . What are the economic problems caused by inflation , and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public ?	0	economic
 Consider a very short story : “ The Land of Funny Money . ”	0	economic
 4872 . The problem of a good - looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly - looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes .	0	economic
 The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an adjustment for inflation .	0	economic
 4875 . The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles .	0	economic
 These plans are tax deferred , and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer , their 401(k ) comes with them .	0	economic
 To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners . However , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation .	0	economic
 4878 . Inflation can make long - term planning difficult .	0	economic
 In discussing unintended redistributions , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation .	0	economic
 Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty .	0	economic
 4881 . An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs .	0	economic
 Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation .	0	economic
 4884 . The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing .	0	economic
 Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972 , the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index .	0	economic
 Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	1	economic
 4887 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic
 4890 . A few decades ago , it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes , trains , and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade .	1	economic
 This measurement is called the merchandise trade balance .	0	economic
 In most high - income economies , including the United States , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services compose more than half .	0	economic
 4893 . Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) within the U.S. Department of Commerce , using a variety of different sources .	0	economic
 4896 . The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers , which are payments made by government , private charities , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received .	1	economic
 Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category , as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities .	0	economic
 4899 . The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage , which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter .	0	economic
 The following Work It Out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s . Calculating Comparative Advantage	0	economic
 4902 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 4905 . When the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital .	0	economic
 The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways .	0	economic
 4908 . A nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these two are actually quite separate .	0	economic
 It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports .	0	economic
 A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is exported .	1	economic
 4911 . The next three chapters take up this task .	0	economic
 This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium .	0	economic
 This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals .	1	economic
 4914 . The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy .	1	economic
 Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists . If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur .	1	economic
 To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .	0	economic
 304 . The carotenoids found in fruit — such as the red of tomato ( lycopene ) , the yellow of corn seeds ( zeaxanthin ) , or the orange of an orange peel ( β - carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers .	0	biology
 In photosynthesis , carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy .	0	biology
 When a leaf is exposed to full sun , the light - dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy ; if that energy is not handled properly , it can do significant damage .	0	biology
 310 . Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids .	0	biology
 The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “ packet ” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state .	0	biology
 In short , the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet .	0	biology
 313 . The reaction center of PSII ( called P680 ) delivers its high - energy electrons , one at the time , to the primary electron acceptor , and through the electron transport chain ( Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine ) to PSI .	1	biology
 P680 ’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low - energy electron from water ; thus , water is split and PSII is re - reduced after every photoact .	0	biology
 316 . The number of carbon atoms remains the same , as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions ( 3 atoms from 3CO2 + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-PGA ) .	1	biology
 This process is called carbon fixation , because CO2 is “ fixed ” from an inorganic form into organic molecules .	0	biology
 319 . Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .	1	biology
" An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands ."	0	biology
 A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , delivering a signal in the process .	1	biology
 322 . Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals .	1	biology
 Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix .	0	biology
 325 . When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .	0	biology
 The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly ; this enables an immediate response , such as , Take your hand off the stove !	0	biology
 328 . Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells .	1	biology
 These water - filled channels allow small signaling molecules , called intracellular mediators , to diffuse between the two cells .	0	biology
 Small molecules , such as calcium ions ( Ca2 + ) , are able to move between cells , but large molecules like proteins and DNA can not fit through the channels .	0	biology
 331 . Each cell - surface receptor has three main components : an external ligand - binding domain , a hydrophobic membrane - spanning region , and an intracellular domain inside the cell .	0	biology
 The ligand - binding domain is also called the extracellular domain .	0	biology
 The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely , depending on the type of receptor .	0	biology
 334 . Enzyme - linked receptors are cell - surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme .	1	biology
 In some cases , the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme .	0	biology
 337 . In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .	1	biology
 A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .	1	biology
 The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other .	0	biology
 340 . Phosphates are also often added to serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues of proteins , where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase .	1	biology
 Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate .	0	biology
 343 . Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP - dependent kinase ( A - kinase ) .	0	biology
 A - kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways : It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins , activating them in the process .	1	biology
 346 . The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor .	0	biology
 An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function .	1	biology
 In this case , the inhibitor is a protein called Iκ - B , which binds to the regulatory protein NF - κB .	0	biology
 349 . Inside the cell , many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades .	0	biology
 For example , phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation .	1	biology
 Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase , and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2 + pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell .	0	biology
 352 . When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level , specific gene expression is initiated , and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light .	0	biology
 Because the number of cells present in the environment ( cell density ) is the determining factor for signaling , bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing .	1	biology
 In politics and business , a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue .	1	biology
 355 . Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate , a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cell ’s genetic information is necessary .	0	biology
 A cell ’s DNA , packaged as a double - stranded DNA molecule , is called its genome .	1	biology
 In prokaryotes , the genome is composed of a single , double - stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 358 . The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .	0	biology
 Human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes , or sex cells ; these are eggs and sperm , and are designated 1n , or haploid . There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell .	1	biology
 The condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus ( top ) , removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide ( right ) , and artificially arranged according to length ( left ) ; an arrangement like this is called a karyotype .	1	biology
 361 . In the first level of compaction , short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The DNA - histone complex is called chromatin .	0	biology
 364 . When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .	0	biology
 The connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere .	1	biology
 The conjoined sister chromatids , with a diameter of about 1 µm , are visible under a light microscope .	0	biology
 367 . During interphase , the cell grows and DNA is replicated .	1	biology
 During the mitotic phase , the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated , and the cell divides .	1	biology
 370 . The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .	1	biology
 The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle , the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis .	1	biology
 At the center of each animal cell , the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod - like objects , the centrioles , which are at right angles to each other .	1	biology
 373 . The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned , separated , and move into two new , identical daughter cells .	1	biology
 The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis , or nuclear division .	1	biology
 The second portion of the mitotic phase , called cytokinesis , is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells . Link to Learning	1	biology
 376 . Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes , pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen .	0	biology
 The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become visible under a light microscope .	0	biology
 379 . During metaphase , the “ change phase , ” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate , or the equatorial plane , midway between the two poles of the cell .	1	biology
 The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins .	0	biology
 382 . Cytokinesis , or “ cell motion , ” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells .	1	biology
 Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells .	0	biology
 385 . Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase , closely followed by the mitotic phase .	0	biology
 Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide .	0	biology
 The cell is in a quiescent ( inactive ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle .	1	biology
 388 . The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .	1	biology
 Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .	1	biology
 Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene .	0	biology
 391 . Two groups of proteins , called cyclins and cyclin - dependent kinases ( Cdks ) , are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints .	1	biology
 The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 394 . The packing proteins of bacteria are , however , related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes . The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell .	0	biology
 The starting point of replication , the origin , is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Replication of the DNA is bidirectional , moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously .	0	biology
 397 . Sexual reproduction requires fertilization , the union of two cells from two individual organisms .	1	biology
 If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes , then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes .	0	biology
 403 . During DNA duplication in the S phase , each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies , called sister chromatids , that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins . Cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase II .	1	biology
 406 . The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non - sister homologous chromatids , a process called crossing over .	1	biology
 Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata ( singular = chiasma ) ( [ link]).In species such as humans , even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous ( most of their genes differ ) , they have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I .	0	biology
 A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology .	0	biology
 409 . Following crossover , the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed .	0	biology
 At the end of prophase I , the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ( [ link ] ) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible .	1	biology
 412 . Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles .	0	biology
 What happens between these two events depends on the organism .	0	biology
 415 . Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle .	0	biology
 The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes , because they produce gametes from specialized cells .	1	biology
 Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid .	0	biology
 418 . In 1866 , he published his work , Experiments in Plant Hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn . Mendel ’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed , incorrectly , that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring ; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation .	0	biology
 Continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height .	1	biology
 Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .	0	biology
 421 . Mendel performed hybridizations , which involve mating two true - breeding individuals that have different traits .	1	biology
 In the pea , which is naturally self - pollinating , this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety .	0	biology
 424 . Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .	0	biology
 He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2 , or second filial , generation .	0	biology
 Mendel ’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations , and so on , but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel ’s postulates . In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns , Mendel crossed plants that were true - breeding for violet flower color with plants true - breeding for white flower color ( the P generation ) .	0	biology
 427 . He called these , respectively , dominant and recessive traits .	0	biology
 Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .	1	biology
 Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .	1	biology
 430 . On the other hand , the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway .	0	biology
 The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event , of two mutually exclusive events , is the sum of their individual probabilities .	1	biology
 433 . The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .	1	biology
 An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .	1	biology
 Mendel ’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype .	0	biology
 436 . When fertilization occurs between two true - breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic , the process is called a monohybrid cross , and the resulting offspring are monohybrids .	1	biology
 Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic .	0	biology
 439 . Of course , doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical .	0	biology
 Instead , geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 442 . Although individual humans ( and all diploid organisms ) can only have two alleles for a given gene , multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed .	0	biology
 Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .	1	biology
 All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .	0	biology
 445 . Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis , the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes .	0	biology
 When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome , but not on the Y chromosome , it is said to be X - linked .	1	biology
 448 . For instance , the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote . A single copy of the wild - type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival .	0	biology
 The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote ; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age .	1	biology
 Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form .	0	biology
 451 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .	1	biology
 The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .	0	biology
 454 . In epistasis , the interaction between genes is antagonistic , such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another .	1	biology
 “ Epistasis ” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “ standing upon . ” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking .	0	biology
 457 . If the genes are unlinked , the individual should produce AB , Ab , aB , and ab gametes with equal frequencies , according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment .	1	biology
 Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .	1	biology
 Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .	1	biology
 460 . Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked , but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur .	0	biology
 Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units , or centimorgans ( cM ) , in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.By representing alleles in a linear map , Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked ( recombination frequency = 0 ) to being perfectly unlinked ( recombination frequency = 0.5 ) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome .	1	biology
 Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross .	0	biology
 463 . In a given species , chromosomes can be identified by their number , size , centromere position , and banding pattern .	0	biology
 In a human karyotype , autosomes or “ body chromosomes ” ( all of the non – sex chromosomes ) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest ( chromosome 1 ) to smallest ( chromosome 22 ) .	1	biology
 The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes .	0	biology
 466 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .	1	biology
 An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .	1	biology
 469 . Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes , variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects .	0	biology
 In part , this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation .	0	biology
 Early in development , when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells ( relative to trillions in the newborn ) , one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent ( dormant ) structure called a Barr body .	1	biology
 472 . A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different , nonhomologous chromosome .	1	biology
 Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences .	0	biology
 475 . The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site .	0	biology
 An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs .	1	biology
 ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .	0	biology
 478 . The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end .	0	biology
 Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .	1	biology
 Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .	0	biology
 481 . This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .	0	biology
 The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .	1	biology
 Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .	0	biology
 484 . The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .	1	biology
 Topoisomerase prevents the over - winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up ; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it .	1	biology
 As synthesis proceeds , the RNA primers are replaced by DNA .	0	biology
 487 . Some errors are not corrected during replication , but are instead corrected after replication is completed ; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it ; this is then replaced by the correct base .	0	biology
 490 . Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .	0	biology
 Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .	1	biology
 Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .	1	biology
 493 . Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .	1	biology
 Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .	1	biology
 The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions , in which one base is replaced by another .	1	biology
 496 . The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres , which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene .	1	biology
 In a way , these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide .	0	biology
 499 . The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence .	0	biology
 However , the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear , such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1 , nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2 , and so on . Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA .	0	biology
 Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein .	1	biology
 502 . These nucleotide triplets are called codons .	1	biology
 The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation , the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained .	0	biology
 505 . Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .	0	biology
 The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .	1	biology
 Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .	1	biology
 The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .	1	biology
 508 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .	1	biology
 Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .	1	biology
 511 . Without σ , the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish .	0	biology
 The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme .	1	biology
 514 . One is protein - based and the other is RNA - based .	0	biology
 Rho - dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein , which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain .	1	biology
 Near the end of the gene , the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls .	0	biology
 517 . RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus .	0	biology
 This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre - rRNA , transfer pre - RNAs ( pre - tRNAs ) , and small nuclear pre - RNAs .	0	biology
 The tRNAs have a critical role in translation ; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain .	0	biology
 520 . Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed .	0	biology
 Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation .	1	biology
 523 . The corresponding amino acid must be added later , once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm .	0	biology
 Through the process of tRNA “ charging , ” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases .	1	biology
 At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids ; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species .	0	biology
 526 . Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG , but this is not always the case .	0	biology
 According to Kozak ’s rules , the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon .	1	biology
 Kozak ’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes : 5'-gccRccAUGG-3 ' .	0	biology
 529 . Usually , this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides .	0	biology
 The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this .	0	biology
 532 . Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons , which correspond to protein - coding sequences ( ex - on signifies that they are expressed ) , and intervening sequences called introns ( int - ron denotes their intervening role ) , which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre - mRNA during processing .	1	biology
 Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins .	0	biology
 535 . All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA .	0	biology
 The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression .	1	biology
 Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi - cellular organism , each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed .	0	biology
 538 . In prokaryotic cells , there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons : repressors , activators , and inducers .	0	biology
 Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus , whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus .	1	biology
 Finally , inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate .	1	biology
 541 . The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon .	0	biology
 Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site .	0	biology
 This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription .	1	biology
 544 . Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules , there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them .	0	biology
 For example , when glucose is scarce , E .	0	biology
 547 . One such sugar source is lactose .	0	biology
 The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment .	1	biology
 CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon .	1	biology
 550 . When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .	1	biology
 The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .	1	biology
 Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed .	0	biology
 553 . The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) .	1	biology
 The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .	1	biology
 Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm , the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled .	0	biology
 556 . Rather , these are regions that regulate mRNA localization , stability , and protein translation .	0	biology
 The region just before the protein - coding region is called the 5 ' UTR , whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3 ' UTR ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule , depending on the specific RBP that binds .	0	biology
 559 . These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .	0	biology
 Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .	1	biology
 RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA .	0	biology
 562 . The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	0	biology
 565 . At this point , when the initiator complex is assembled , the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released .	0	biology
 The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA .	0	biology
 The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation .	0	biology
 568 . An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc .	0	biology
 Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett ’s Lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph system .	1	biology
 Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably .	0	biology
 571 . Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .	1	biology
 Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .	1	biology
 The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol .	0	biology
 574 . Nucleic acid samples , such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts , can be probed for the presence of certain sequences .	0	biology
 Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection .	1	biology
 Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size .	1	biology
 577 . Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation .	0	biology
 In the bacterial context , the fragment of DNA from the human genome ( or the genome of another organism that is being studied ) is referred to as foreign DNA , or a transgene , to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium , which is called the host DNA .	1	biology
 580 . The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .	0	biology
 Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner ; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA .	1	biology
 Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA , such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single - stranded overhang .	0	biology
 583 . Unicellular organisms , such as bacteria and yeast , naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission ; this is known as cellular cloning .	1	biology
 The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis , which creates an exact replica of the genetic material .	0	biology
 586 . The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .	0	biology
 The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .	1	biology
 If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .	1	biology
 589 . The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing .	1	biology
 Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease - causing gene , family members are advised to undergo genetic testing .	0	biology
 592 . Genomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species .	1	biology
 Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .	1	biology
 595 . Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .	0	biology
 A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co - segregates ( shows genetic linkage ) with a specific trait .	1	biology
 Early geneticists called this linkage analysis .	0	biology
 598 . For example , in experiments performed on the garden pea , it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant ’s pollen were linked traits , and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome .	0	biology
 The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination , which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA , such as nonsister chromatids .	1	biology
 Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes .	1	biology
 601 . It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .	0	biology
 Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation , such as x - rays , to break the DNA into fragments .	1	biology
 The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments .	0	biology
 5602 . Despite the ongoing economic recovery , the job market is actually growing in some areas , but in a very polarized fashion .	0	sociology
 Polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market , with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education .	1	sociology
 At one end , there has been strong demand for low - skilled , low - paying jobs in industries like food service and retail .	0	sociology
 5608 . For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations .	1	sociology
 This can lead to a sense of xenophobia , which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods .	1	sociology
 Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of this risk and attempt to “ Americanize ” their products , selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were nevertheless made in Mexico .	0	sociology
 5611 . Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .	0	sociology
 Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .	1	sociology
 The complex U.S. economy , and the economies of other industrialized nations , meet the definition of organic solidarity .	0	sociology
 5614 . Governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called mercantilism .	0	sociology
 Mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges .	1	sociology
 The resulting restrictive practices and exacting demands included monopolies , bans on certain goods , high tariffs , and exclusivity requirements .	0	sociology
 5617 . Socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership ( often referred to as “ state run ” ) of goods and their production , with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the members of a society .	1	sociology
 Under socialism , everything that people produce , including services , is considered a social product .	0	sociology
 5620 . Convergence theory explains that as a country 's economy grows , its societal organization changes to become more like that of an industrialized society .	1	sociology
 Rather than staying in one job for a lifetime , people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise .	0	sociology
 5623 . Those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society .	0	sociology
 They focus on the way reality is socially constructed through day - to - day interaction and how society is composed of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols . One important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career inheritance .	0	sociology
 This concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as their parents , which is a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies ( Antony 1998 ) .	1	sociology
 5626 . Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing .	1	sociology
 A caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives .	1	sociology
 People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents , interests , or potential .	0	sociology
 5632 . Status ConsistencySocial stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income , education , and occupation .	0	sociology
 Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency , or lack thereof , of an individual ’s rank across these factors .	1	sociology
 Caste systems correlate with high status consistency , whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency .	0	sociology
 5635 . Social MobilitySocial mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system .	1	sociology
 When people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class , they experience social mobility .	0	sociology
 5638 . Dropping out of school , losing a job , or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and , therefore , downward social mobility . It is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes .	1	sociology
 This is known as intergenerational mobility .	0	sociology
 For example , an upper - class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class .	0	sociology
 5641 . Class traits , also called class markers , are the typical behaviors , customs , and norms that define each class .	1	sociology
 Class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures .	0	sociology
 5644 . To symbolically communicate social standing , people often engage in conspicuous consumption , which is the purchase and use of certain products to make a social statement about status .	1	sociology
 Carrying pricey but eco - friendly water bottles could indicate a person ’s social standing .	0	sociology
 5647 . While stratification in the United States refers to the unequal distribution of resources among individuals , global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations .	0	sociology
 There are two dimensions to this stratification : gaps between nations and gaps within nations .	0	sociology
 5650 . The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .	1	sociology
 The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .	1	sociology
 Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .	0	sociology
 5653 . For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .	0	sociology
 We can look at free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) as an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in the matter of global trade . Peripheral nations have very little industrialization ; what they do have often represents the outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations .	0	sociology
 They typically have unstable governments , inadequate social programs , and are economically dependent on core nations for jobs and aid .	0	sociology
 5656 . Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b).High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .	0	sociology
 Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .	1	sociology
 Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .	1	sociology
 5659 . Social scientists define global poverty in different ways and take into account the complexities and the issues of relativism described above .	0	sociology
 Relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford necessities but are unable to meet their society ’s average standard of living .	1	sociology
 People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .	0	sociology
 5662 . What do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in New York , a piecework seamstress working from her home in Mumbai , and a street tortilla vendor in Mexico City have in common ?	0	sociology
 They are all members of the underground economy , a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by taxes , government permits , or human protections .	1	sociology
 Official statistics before the worldwide recession posit that the underground economy accounted for over 50 percent of nonagricultural work in Latin America ; the figure went as high as 80 percent in parts of Asia and Africa ( Chen 2001 ) .	0	sociology
 5665 . According to modernization theory , low - income countries are affected by their lack of industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through ( Armer and Katsillis 2010):an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work	1	sociology
 5668 . Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions ( Mongolia and the Caucus Mountains , for instance ) or skin tones ( black , white , yellow , and red , for example).Social science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists , the American Sociological Association , and the American Psychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race .	0	sociology
 Over time , the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse , and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories .	0	sociology
 Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned , based on pseudoscience , and used to justify racist practices ( Omi and Winant 1994 ; Graves 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5671 . Scapegoat theory , developed initially from Dollard ’s ( 1939 ) Frustration - Aggression theory , suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group .	1	sociology
 History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group .	0	sociology
 5674 . A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .	1	sociology
 A 1970 documentary called Eye of the Storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops , by showing how defining one category of people as superior ( children with blue eyes ) results in prejudice against people who are not part of the favored category . While prejudice is not necessarily specific to race , racism is a stronger type of prejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior or inferior to others ; it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to disadvantage a racial minority .	1	sociology
 The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .	0	sociology
 5677 . While prejudice refers to biased thinking , discrimination consists of actions against a group of people .	1	sociology
 Discrimination can be based on age , religion , health , and other indicators ; race - based laws against discrimination strive to address this set of social problems .	0	sociology
 5680 . In the days after , it was revealed that only three members of the town ’s fifty - three - member police force were black ( Nobles and Bosman 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks , with some commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial inequality and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community , in local political establishments , and in the police force ( Bouie 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 Redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities , while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to accumulate wealth .	1	sociology
 5683 . Culture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture .	1	sociology
 We grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice .	0	sociology
 5686 . Segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups , particularly in residence , but also in workplace and social functions .	1	sociology
 It is important to distinguish between de jure segregation ( segregation that is enforced by law ) and de facto segregation ( segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors ) .	1	sociology
 5689 . Amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group .	1	sociology
 Amalgamation creates the classic “ melting pot ” analogy ; unlike the “ salad bowl , ” in which each culture retains its individuality , the “ melting pot ” ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely . Amalgamation , also known as miscegenation , is achieved through intermarriage between races .	0	sociology
 5692 . Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity .	1	sociology
 Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male . A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Therefore , the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable .	0	sociology
 5695 . Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation .	0	sociology
 Some is based on heterosexism , which Herek ( 1990 ) suggests is both an ideology and a set of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over other sexual orientations .	1	sociology
 Much like racism and sexism , heterosexism is a systematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions , offering power to those who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously disadvantaging those who do not .	0	sociology
 5698 . To a certain extent , men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity .	0	sociology
 Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .	1	sociology
" 5701 . Gender Dysphoria , on the other hand , removes some of that stigma by taking the word "" disorder "" out while maintaining a category that will protect patient access to care , including hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery ."	0	sociology
 In the DSM-5 , Gender Dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with .	1	sociology
 For a person to be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria , there must be a marked difference between the individual ’s expressed / experienced gender and the gender others would assign him or her , and it must continue for at least six months .	0	sociology
 5704 . In other words , both gender and sexuality are socially constructed .	0	sociology
 The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .	1	sociology
 This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .	0	sociology
 5707 . Queer TheoryQueer Theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies Western society ’s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual orientation .	1	sociology
 According to Jagose ( 1996 ) , Queer [ Theory ] focuses on mismatches between anatomical sex , gender identity , and sexual orientation , not just division into male / female or homosexual / hetereosexual .	0	sociology
 5710 . Gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges encountered as seniors grow older .	1	sociology
 Gerontologists investigate age , aging , and the aged .	0	sociology
 5719 . Each person experiences age - related changes based on many factors .	0	sociology
 Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging , while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging ( Whitbourne and Whitbourne 2010 ) .	1	sociology
 5722 . Should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity ?	0	sociology
 Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician - assisted suicide : the voluntary or physician - assisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one ’s life .	1	sociology
 This right to have a doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial .	0	sociology
 5725 . He did n’t intend to treat people differently based on personal or cultural biases , but he did .	0	sociology
 Ageism is discrimination ( when someone acts on a prejudice ) based on age .	1	sociology
 Dr. Robert Butler coined the term in 1968 , noting that ageism exists in all cultures ( Brownell ) .	0	sociology
 5731 . There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective .	0	sociology
 Modernization theory ( Cowgill and Holmes 1972 ) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization .	1	sociology
 As societies modernize , the status of elders decreases , and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion .	0	sociology
 5734 . One microanalytical theory is Rose ’s ( 1962 ) subculture of aging theory , which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded ( due to age ) , voluntarily or involuntarily , from participating in other groups .	1	sociology
 This theory suggests that elders will disengage from society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and interests .	0	sociology
 5740 . A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .	0	sociology
 A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .	0	sociology
 These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage . Drawing on two sociological paradigms , the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism .	0	sociology
 5743 . In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage .	0	sociology
 In a majority of cultures ( 78 percent ) , polygamy , or being married to more than one person at a time , is accepted ( Murdock 1967 ) , with most polygamous societies existing in northern Africa and east Asia ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .	1	sociology
 Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .	0	sociology
 5746 . In the United States , polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal .	0	sociology
 The act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states .	1	sociology
 Polygamy in the United States is often associated with those of the Mormon faith , although in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy .	0	sociology
 5749 . Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .	0	sociology
 Unilateral descent ( the tracing of kinship through one parent only ) is practiced in the other 40 percent of the world ’s societies , with high concentration in pastoral cultures ( O’Neal 2006 ) .	1	sociology
 5752 . Patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and community ; it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives .	0	sociology
 In China , where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common , the written symbols for maternal grandmother ( wáipá ) are separately translated to mean “ outsider ” and “ women ” ( Cohen 2011).Similarly , in matrilocal residence systems , where it is customary for the husband to live with his wife ’s blood relatives ( or her family of orientation ) , the husband can feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider .	1	sociology
 The Minangkabau people , a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of West Sumatra in Indonesia , believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues relating to the home or family ( Joseph and Najmabadi 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5755 . This is a decrease from 77 percent in 1980 ( U.S. Census 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 This two - parent family structure is known as a nuclear family , referring to married parents and children as the nucleus , or core , of the group .	1	sociology
 Recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married .	0	sociology
 5761 . Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .	1	sociology
 Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .	1	sociology
 Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .	0	sociology
 5767 . The term ecclesia , originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens , Greece , now refers to a congregation .	0	sociology
 In sociology , the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to .	1	sociology
 5770 . Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .	1	sociology
 Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .	1	sociology
 It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .	1	sociology
 5773 . A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000 people who attend regular weekly services .	1	sociology
 As of 2009 , the largest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas , boasting an average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 ( Bogan 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 5776 . In contrast , informal education describes learning about cultural values , norms , and expected behaviors by participating in a society .	1	sociology
 This type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home .	0	sociology
 5779 . Education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility .	0	sociology
 This function is referred to as social placement .	0	sociology
 College and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek .	0	sociology
 5782 . Many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence .	0	sociology
 The cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula as well as in the hidden curriculum , which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that students learn through informal learning and cultural transmission .	1	sociology
 This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .	0	sociology
 5785 . The labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees that symbolize completion of education .	0	sociology
 Credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or degrees to show that a person has a certain skill , has attained a certain level of education , or has met certain job qualifications .	1	sociology
 These certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has achieved , and allows the labeling of that individual .	0	sociology
 5788 . opined , “ The measure of a man is what he does with power , ” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted , “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely ” ( 1887 ) .	0	sociology
 Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define . Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) .	1	sociology
 Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments .	0	sociology
 5794 . Most people generally agree that anarchy , or the absence of organized government , does not facilitate a desirable living environment for society , but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the particulars of how a population should be governed .	1	sociology
 Throughout history , various forms of government have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets , each with pros and cons .	0	sociology
 5797 . In today ’s global political climate , monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies , governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution .	1	sociology
 Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies .	0	sociology
 5800 . The late Kim Jong - Il , North Korean dictator , and his successor , Kim Jong - Un , exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship . Some dictatorships do not align themselves with any particular belief system or ideology ; the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator .	0	sociology
 A totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects’ lives ; including occupation , religious beliefs , and number of children permitted in each family .	1	sociology
 Citizens may be forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches and demonstrations .	0	sociology
 5299 . In March 2014 , a group of musicians got together in a fish market in Odessa for a spontaneous performance of Beethoven 's “ Ode to Joy ” from his Ninth Symphony .	0	sociology
 While tensions were building over Ukraine 's efforts to join the European Union , and even as Russian troops had taken control of the Ukrainian airbase in Belbek , the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song . Spontaneous gatherings like this are called flash mobs .	0	sociology
 They often are captured on video and shared on the Internet ; frequently they go viral .	0	sociology
 5302 . Turner and Killian ( 1993 ) identified four types of crowds .	0	sociology
 Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .	1	sociology
 Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 5308 . They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior , especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors .	0	sociology
 Emergent norm theory asserts that , in this circumstance , people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular ( individual ) set of norms , which may change as the crowd experience evolves .	1	sociology
 This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective . For Turner and Killian , the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation , or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar .	0	sociology
 5311 . Social movements are purposeful , organized groups that strive to work toward a common social goal .	1	sociology
 While most of us learned about social movements in history classes , we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused —and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements .	0	sociology
 5314 . Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .	0	sociology
 Revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society .	1	sociology
 These include the 1960s counterculture movement , including the revolutionary group The Weather Underground , as well as anarchist collectives .	0	sociology
 5320 . Churches and their ministers joined the struggle , and the protest organization In Friendship was formed as well as The Friendly Club and the Club From Nowhere .	0	sociology
 A social movement industry , which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals , was growing . Martin Luther King Jr. emerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement , gained respect from elites in the federal government , and aided by even more emerging SMOs such as the Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , among others .	1	sociology
 Several still exist today .	0	sociology
 5323 . As you can see , there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames .	0	sociology
 Finally , motivational framing is the call to action : what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame ?	1	sociology
 These frames are action - oriented .	0	sociology
 5326 . Collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change , which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations .	0	sociology
 Essentially , any disruptive shift in the status quo , be it intentional or random , human - caused or natural , can lead to social change .	0	sociology
 5329 . Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .	1	sociology
 A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .	1	sociology
 5332 . The term culture refers to the group ’s shared practices , values , and beliefs .	1	sociology
 Culture encompasses a group ’s way of life , from routine , everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members ' lives .	0	sociology
 5335 . Some sociologists study social facts , which are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life , that may contribute to these changes in the family .	1	sociology
 Do people in the United States view marriage and family differently than before ?	0	sociology
 5338 . He argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to a very large extent on interactions with others .	0	sociology
 Mead called specific individuals that impacted a person ’s life significant others , and he also conceptualized “ generalized others ” as the organized and generalized attitude of a social group .	1	sociology
 Mead ’s work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro - level of analysis .	0	sociology
 5341 . The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology .	0	sociology
 Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants .	1	sociology
 Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .	0	sociology
 5344 . For example , although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon , Émile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it .	0	sociology
 His studied social ties within a group , or social solidarity , and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion - based differences .	1	sociology
 Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans who had ended their lives , and he did indeed find differences based on religion .	0	sociology
 5347 . Functionalism , also called structural - functional theory , sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society .	1	sociology
 Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .	0	sociology
 5350 . Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .	0	sociology
 In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .	1	sociology
 5353 . Latent functions can be beneficial , neutral , or harmful .	0	sociology
 Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions .	1	sociology
 In education , examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades , truancy , dropping out , not graduating , and not finding suitable employment .	0	sociology
 5356 . For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message .	0	sociology
 The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922–1982 ) to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis .	0	sociology
 Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “ scripts . ” Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958).Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods , such as in - depth interviews or participant observation , because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live .	1	sociology
 5359 . Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .	0	sociology
 Researchers Rotton and Kelly ( 1985 ) conducted a meta - analysis of research on the full moon ’s effects on behavior .	0	sociology
 Meta - analysis is a technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are evaluated together .	1	sociology
 5362 . In this field , results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before — knowledge of other cultures , knowledge of rituals and beliefs , or knowledge of trends and attitudes .	0	sociology
 No matter what research approach they use , researchers want to maximize the study ’s reliability , which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced .	1	sociology
 Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .	0	sociology
 5365 . The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review , which is a review of any existing similar or related studies .	0	sociology
 A visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study .	0	sociology
 5368 . In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .	1	sociology
 The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .	1	sociology
 5371 . Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research .	0	sociology
 In planning studies ' designs , sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation : survey , field research , experiment , and secondary data analysis , or use of existing sources .	0	sociology
 Every research method comes with plusses and minuses , and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use . Surveys	0	sociology
 5374 . A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .	0	sociology
 Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .	1	sociology
 The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .	0	sociology
 5377 . People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously .	0	sociology
 This type of information is qualitative data — results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting .	1	sociology
 Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate .	0	sociology
 5380 . Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation .	0	sociology
 And while field research looks for correlation , its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables .	0	sociology
 5383 . Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event .	0	sociology
 A case study is an in - depth analysis of a single event , situation , or individual .	1	sociology
 To conduct a case study , a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records , conducts interviews , engages in direct observation and even participant observation , if possible . Researchers might use this method to study a single case of , for example , a foster child , drug lord , cancer patient , criminal , or rape victim .	0	sociology
 5386 . One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research ( or unobtrusive research ) , meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people ’s behaviors .	1	sociology
 Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people , using previously published data does n’t require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process .	0	sociology
 5389 . While he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values , he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses .	0	sociology
 Sociologists , he stated , must establish value neutrality , a practice of remaining impartial , without bias or judgment , during the course of a study and in publishing results ( 1949 ) .	1	sociology
 Sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data .	0	sociology
 5392 . Nonmaterial culture , in contrast , consists of the ideas , attitudes , and beliefs of a society .	1	sociology
 Material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked , and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas .	0	sociology
 5395 . The first , and perhaps most crucial , elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs .	0	sociology
 Values are a culture ’s standard for discerning what is good and just in society .	1	sociology
 Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .	0	sociology
 5398 . Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .	1	sociology
 But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .	1	sociology
 In an ideal culture , there would be no traffic accidents , murders , poverty , or racial tension .	0	sociology
 5401 . These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured , or what sociologists call norms .	1	sociology
 Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good , right , and important , and most members of the society adhere to them .	0	sociology
 5404 . Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by . Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways .	0	sociology
 Mores ( mor - ays ) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group .	1	sociology
 Violating them can have serious consequences .	0	sociology
 5407 . While different cultures have varying systems of symbols , one symbol is common to all : language .	0	sociology
 Language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted .	1	sociology
 Some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication , while others rely on only spoken communication and nonverbal actions .	0	sociology
 5410 . The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society .	1	sociology
 Popular culture events might include a parade , a baseball game , or the season finale of a television show .	0	sociology
 5413 . An innovation refers to an object or concept ’s initial appearance in society — it ’s innovative because it is markedly new .	1	sociology
 There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .	0	sociology
 5416 . Material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture ; technology can spread through society in a matter of months , but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change .	0	sociology
 Sociologist William F. Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture ( Ogburn 1957 ) .	1	sociology
 Culture lag can also cause tangible problems .	0	sociology
 5419 . Exactly what is a society ?	0	sociology
 In sociological terms , society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community and share the same culture .	1	sociology
 On a broader scale , society consists of the people and institutions around us , our shared beliefs , and our cultural ideas .	0	sociology
 5422 . Previously , the depletion of a region ’s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock .	0	sociology
 Horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops .	0	sociology
 They were similar to hunter - gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival , but since they did n’t have to abandon their location to follow resources , they were able to start permanent settlements .	0	sociology
 5425 . Postindustrial SocietyInformation societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development .	0	sociology
 Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services .	1	sociology
 5428 . In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	0	sociology
 Durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life . Following the ideas of Comte and Spencer , Durkheim likened society to a living organism , in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive .	1	sociology
 Even the socially deviant members of society are necessary , Durkheim argued , as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms .	0	sociology
 5431 . Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge .	0	sociology
 While the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is , in the long run , advantageous for a society , Durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and “ normlessness . ” One of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie .	0	sociology
 Anomie — literally , “ without law”—is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness .	1	sociology
 5434 . Marx described modern society in terms of alienation .	0	sociology
 Alienation refers to the condition in which the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society , work , or the sense of self .	1	sociology
 Marx defined four specific types of alienation .	0	sociology
 5437 . Weber ’s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization .	0	sociology
 A rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition .	1	sociology
 5440 . In a sense , it exists by consensus , both prior and current .	0	sociology
 This is an example of the process of institutionalization , the act of implanting a convention or norm into society .	1	sociology
 Bear in mind that the institution , while socially constructed , is still quite real .	0	sociology
 5443 . Roles and StatusAs you can imagine , people employ many types of behaviors in day - to - day life .	0	sociology
 Roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person ’s social status .	1	sociology
 Currently , while reading this text , you are playing the role of a student .	0	sociology
 5446 . Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .	1	sociology
 As a daughter or son , you occupy a different status than as a neighbor or employee .	0	sociology
 5449 . Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .	0	sociology
 Similarly , a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory .	0	sociology
 A parent who also has a full - time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis .	0	sociology
 5455 . In the 1850s , as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved , suburbs developed .	0	sociology
 Suburbs are the communities surrounding cities , typically close enough for a daily commute in , but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords .	1	sociology
 The bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl .	0	sociology
 5458 . Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	0	sociology
 New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .	1	sociology
 These metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the U.S. landscape . The suburban sprawl in Toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion .	0	sociology
 5461 . The world ’s most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south , a marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north .	0	sociology
 In the next forty years , the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations , particularly in less developed countries , will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment , also called sustainable development ( United Nations , Department of Economic and Social Affairs , Population Division 2014 ) .	1	sociology
 5464 . The subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments .	1	sociology
 This field is closely related to human ecology , which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment .	1	sociology
 5467 . And it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment .	0	sociology
 E - waste is the name for obsolete , broken , and worn - out electronics — from computers to mobile phones to televisions .	1	sociology
 The challenge is that these products , which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence ( the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics ) , have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them , which makes for a dangerous combination .	1	sociology
 5470 . Without regular interaction — the holding , hugging , talking , the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children — she had not learned to walk or to speak , to eat or to interact , to play or even to understand the world around her .	0	sociology
 From a sociological point of view , Danielle had not been socialized . Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .	1	sociology
 It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .	0	sociology
 5473 . Sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate ( the number of live births per 1,000 people per year ) .	1	sociology
 Just as fertility measures childbearing , the mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die .	1	sociology
 The crude death rate is a number derived from the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year .	1	sociology
 5482 . Moral development is an important part of the socialization process .	0	sociology
 The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society .	1	sociology
 5485 . Fracking , another word for hydraulic fracturing , is a method used to recover gas and oil from shale by drilling down into the earth and directing a high - pressure mixture of water , sand , and proprietary chemicals into the rock .	1	sociology
 Commonly , this process also includes drilling horizontally into the rock to create new pathways for gas to travel .	0	sociology
 5488 . First , members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation ceremony .	0	sociology
 In a degradation ceremony , new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities .	1	sociology
 The process is sometimes gentle .	0	sociology
 5494 . Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .	1	sociology
 These people are considered a category , and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000 are referred to as “ Millennials . ” Why are Millennials a category and not a group ?	1	sociology
 Because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other . Interestingly , people within an aggregate or category can become a group .	0	sociology
 5497 . They may also be task - focused and time - limited .	0	sociology
 These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal- or task - oriented than emotional .	0	sociology
 A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group .	0	sociology
 5500 . A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad .	1	sociology
 Georg Simmel ( 1858–1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two - member group , and a triad , which is a three - member group ( Simmel 1902 ) .	1	sociology
 In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist .	0	sociology
 5506 . A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .	0	sociology
 In contrast , a laissez - faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands - off , allowing group members to self - manage and make their own decisions .	1	sociology
 An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art .	0	sociology
 5512 . The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations .	0	sociology
 Coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced , or pushed , to join .	1	sociology
 These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .	0	sociology
 5515 . People often complain about bureaucracies––declaring them slow , rule - bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly .	0	sociology
 Let ’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors .	1	sociology
 For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks .	0	sociology
 5518 . Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations .	1	sociology
 This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization .	0	sociology
 5521 . The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions .	1	sociology
 This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) .	0	sociology
 5524 . All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .	1	sociology
 The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .	0	sociology
 Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .	0	sociology
 5527 . A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .	0	sociology
 Negative sanctions are punishments for violating norms .	1	sociology
 Being arrested is a punishment for shoplifting .	0	sociology
 5530 . Sociologist Robert Merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society , but he expanded on Durkheim ’s ideas by developing strain theory , which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates .	1	sociology
 From birth , we ’re encouraged to achieve the “ American Dream ” of financial success .	0	sociology
 5533 . Conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance .	1	sociology
 Unlike functionalists , conflict theorists do n’t see these factors as positive functions of society .	0	sociology
 5536 . Those who do , however , have often been labeled “ deviant ” by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves .	0	sociology
 Labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society .	1	sociology
 Thus , what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them , but by the reactions of others to these behaviors .	0	sociology
 5545 . If you use a crowbar to break into a car , you are committing a nonviolent crime ; if you mug someone with the crowbar , you are committing a violent crime .	0	sociology
 When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .	0	sociology
 An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .	1	sociology
 5548 . Both victims were drugged , sodomized , and forced to burn one another with cigarettes .	0	sociology
 When questioned by police , the ringleader of the crime explained that the victims were gay and “ looked like [ they ] liked it ” ( Wilson and Baker 2010).Attacks based on a person ’s race , religion , or other characteristics are known as hate crimes .	1	sociology
 Hate crimes in the United States evolved from the time of early European settlers and their violence toward Native Americans .	0	sociology
 5551 . Police are a civil force in charge of enforcing laws and public order at a federal , state , or community level .	1	sociology
 No unified national police force exists in the United States , although there are federal law enforcement officers .	0	sociology
 5554 . It is easy to look at the latest sleek Apple product and think technology is a recent addition to our world .	0	sociology
 But from the steam engine to the most cutting - edge robotic surgery tools , technology has described the application of science to address the problems of daily life .	0	sociology
 We might look back at the enormous and clunky computers of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an iPod Shuffle and roll our eyes in disbelief .	0	sociology
 5557 . Numerous facts sheets available through the government , nonprofits , and the private sector outline common safety measures , including the following : become familiar with privacy rights ; read privacy policies when making a purchase ( rather than simply clicking “ accept ” ) ; give out only the minimum information requested by any source ; ask why information is being collected , how it is going to be used , and who will have access it ; and monitor your credit history for red flags that indicate your identity has been compromised .	0	sociology
 Net NeutralityThe issue of net neutrality , the principle that all Internet data should be treated equally by Internet service providers , is part of the national debate about Internet access and the digital divide .	0	sociology
 On one side of this debate is the belief that those who provide Internet service , like those who provide electricity and water , should be treated as common carriers , legally prohibited from discriminating based on the customer or nature of the goods .	0	sociology
 5560 . Theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system , as with most other social problems , are rooted in capitalist society .	0	sociology
 According to conflict theorists , capitalism and the pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health : the changing of something not generally thought of as a commodity into something that can be bought and sold in a marketplace .	0	sociology
 In this view , people with money and power — the dominant group — are the ones who make decisions about how the healthcare system will be run .	0	sociology
 5563 . HealthcareU.S .	0	sociology
 healthcare coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories : public healthcare ( government - funded ) and private healthcare ( privately funded ) .	0	sociology
 The two main publicly funded healthcare programs are Medicare , which provides health services to people over sixty - five years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability , and Medicaid , which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements .	1	sociology
 5566 . One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine , a term that for many people in the United States has negative connotations lingering from the Cold War era and earlier .	0	sociology
 Under a socialized medicine system , the government owns and runs the system .	1	sociology
 It employs the doctors , nurses , and other staff , and it owns and runs the hospitals ( Klein 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 5569 . The discrepancy between black and white Americans shows the gap clearly ; in 2008 , the average life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males : 75.9 compared to 70.9 .	0	sociology
 An even stronger disparity was found in 2007 : the infant mortality , which is the number of deaths in a given time or place , rate for blacks was nearly twice that of whites at 13.2 compared to 5.6 per 1,000 live births ( U.S. Census Bureau 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 According to a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation ( 2007 ) , African Americans also have higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality , from cancer to heart disease to diabetes .	0	sociology
 5572 . In the post - millennial United States , those of us who have never experienced such a disadvantage take for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen .	0	sociology
 We do not think about the relatively recent nature of the protections , unless , of course , we know someone constantly inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations or misfortune of suddenly experiencing a temporary disability . Mental HealthPeople with mental disorders ( a condition that makes it more difficult to cope with everyday life ) and people with mental illness ( a severe , lasting mental disorder that requires long - term treatment ) experience a wide range of effects . According to the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , the most common mental disorders in the United States are anxiety disorders .	1	sociology
 Almost 18 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .	0	sociology
 5575 . Disability refers to a reduction in one ’s ability to perform everyday tasks .	1	sociology
 The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 5578 . Even after slavery was abolished in 1865 , the next 100 years of U.S. history saw institutionalized racism and prejudice against black people .	0	sociology
 In an example of stereotype interchangeability , the same insults that are flung today at the overweight and obese population ( lazy , for instance ) , have been flung at various racial and ethnic groups in earlier history .	0	sociology
 Of course , no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now , except when talking about obese people . Why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward — even to hate — obese people ?	0	sociology
 5581 . In essence , Goffman ( 1963 ) suggests we might view illness as a stigma that can push others to view the ill in an undesirable manner .	0	sociology
 The stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives .	0	sociology
 Many contend that our society and even our healthcare institutions discriminate against certain diseases — like mental disorders , AIDS , venereal diseases , and skin disorders ( Sartorius 2007 ) .	0	sociology
 5584 . This regulatory body will patent three types of innovation .	0	sociology
 Utility patents are the first type .	0	sociology
 These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .	1	sociology
 5587 . Anderson and Tushman ( 1990 ) suggest an evolutionary model of technological change , in which a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of variations .	1	sociology
 Once those are assessed , a prototype emerges , and then a period of slight adjustments to the technology , interrupted by a breakthrough .	0	sociology
 5590 . In this section , we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 As the names suggest , media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross - cultural exchange of ideas , while technological globalization refers to the cross - cultural development and exchange of technology .	1	sociology
 5593 . Technological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion , the spread of technology across borders .	1	sociology
 In the last two decades , there has been rapid improvement in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi - peripheral nations , and a 2008 World Bank report discusses both the benefits and ongoing challenges of this diffusion .	0	sociology
 5596 . Social scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is an entire journal devoted to its study , Surveillance and Society .	0	sociology
 The panoptic surveillance envisioned by Jeremy Bentham , depicted in the form of an all - powerful , all - seeing government by George Orwell in 1984 , and later analyzed by Michel Foucault ( 1975 ) is increasingly realized in the form of technology used to monitor our every move .	0	sociology
 This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly .	0	sociology
 3918 . You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36 , 6 x 7 = 42 , and 6 x 8 = 48 .	0	psychology
 Memorizing these facts is rehearsal . Another strategy is chunking : you organize information into manageable bits or chunks ( Bodie , Powers , & Fitch - Hauser , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers .	0	psychology
 3921 . Use elaborative rehearsal : In a famous article , Craik and Lockhart ( 1972 ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory .	1	psychology
 Their theory is called levels of processing .	0	psychology
 If we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful .	0	psychology
 3924 . Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .	1	psychology
 Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .	1	psychology
 We refer to these domains throughout the chapter .	0	psychology
 3927 . Not all normative events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures .	0	psychology
 Biological milestones , such as puberty , tend to be universal , but social milestones , such as the age when children begin formal schooling , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 For example , in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old , but in developing countries , like Nigeria , children often enter school at an advanced age , if at all ( Huebler , 2005 ; United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization [ UNESCO ] , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3930 . How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?Are we who we are because of nature ( biology and genetics ) , or are we who we are because of nurture ( our environment and culture ) ? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate .	1	psychology
 3933 . Humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another .	0	psychology
 A poignant example is that of Trayvon Martin , a 17-year - old African American who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer , George Zimmerman , in a predominantly White neighborhood in 2012 .	0	psychology
 Zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin .	0	psychology
 3936 . Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .	0	psychology
 Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .	0	psychology
 3939 . Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world .	0	psychology
 Schemata are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information .	1	psychology
 By the time children have reached adulthood , they have created schemata for almost everything .	0	psychology
 3942 . The first stage is the sensorimotor stage , which lasts from birth to about 2 years old .	1	psychology
 During this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior .	0	psychology
 3945 . Kenny ’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces , so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did .	0	psychology
 Children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added .	1	psychology
 3948 . Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition .	1	psychology
 Take , for example , water that you poured into the short , fat glass : You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a couple of drops ) .	0	psychology
 3951 . After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas , Kohlberg reviewed people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 According to Kohlberg , an individual progresses from the capacity for pre - conventional morality ( before age 9 ) to the capacity for conventional morality ( early adolescence ) , and toward attaining post - conventional morality ( once formal operational thought is attained ) , which only a few fully achieve .	0	psychology
 3954 . Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .	1	psychology
 Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .	1	psychology
 3957 . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .	1	psychology
 An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .	1	psychology
 Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective .	0	psychology
 3960 . Therefore , a person ’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001).People from collectivistic cultures , such as some Asian cultures , are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual .	1	psychology
 Activities such as ( a ) preparing a meal , ( b ) hanging out , and ( c ) playing a game engage people in a group .	0	psychology
 3963 . We can understand self - serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution , a belief about the cause of a result .	1	psychology
 One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions : locus of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus unstable ) , and controllability ( controllable versus uncontrollable ) .	0	psychology
 3966 . A mother and father ’s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of conception .	0	psychology
 Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .	0	psychology
 3969 . After the zygote divides for about 7–10 days and has 150 cells , it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus .	1	psychology
 Upon implantation , this multi - cellular organism is called an embryo .	0	psychology
 Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .	0	psychology
 3972 . A teratogen is any environmental agent — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus .	1	psychology
 There are different types of teratogens .	0	psychology
 3975 . Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .	1	psychology
 Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 3978 . In social and emotional development , forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy .	0	psychology
 Attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others .	1	psychology
 Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone .	0	psychology
 3981 . With avoidant attachment , the child is unresponsive to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves .	1	psychology
 The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger .	0	psychology
 3984 . Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles : authoritative , authoritarian , permissive , and uninvolved .	0	psychology
 With the authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits , expresses warmth and affection , and listens to the child ’s point of view .	1	psychology
 Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them .	0	psychology
 3987 . With the uninvolved style of parenting , the parents are indifferent , uninvolved , and sometimes referred to as neglectful .	1	psychology
 They do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands .	0	psychology
 3990 . While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable , the onset and pace of puberty vary widely .	0	psychology
 Several physical changes occur during puberty , such as adrenarche and gonadarche , the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively .	0	psychology
 Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .	0	psychology
 3993 . Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .	1	psychology
 3996 . Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support .	0	psychology
 As we get older , socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( Carstensen , 1992 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3999 . This shared knowledge comes from social norms .	0	psychology
 A social norm is a group ’s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 How are we expected to act ?	0	psychology
 4002 . ZIMBARDO ’S STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENTThe famous Stanford prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues at Stanford University , demonstrated the power of social roles , social norms , and scripts .	0	psychology
 In the summer of 1971 , an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life .	0	psychology
 4005 . Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .	0	psychology
 Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .	1	psychology
 We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies .	0	psychology
 4008 . The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like the group more , due to the justification of effort .	0	psychology
 We do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave .	0	psychology
 4011 . The topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology ( Fiske et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 During the Second World War , Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army .	0	psychology
 After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .	0	psychology
 4014 . The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument ’s worthiness .	0	psychology
 For example , a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car ’s safety features and fuel economy .	0	psychology
 4017 . Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people .	0	psychology
 In one study , a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4020 . The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment . What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure ?	1	psychology
 Research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another dissenter , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity .	0	psychology
 4023 . In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .	1	psychology
 However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .	1	psychology
 What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?	0	psychology
 4026 . Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience .	0	psychology
 When certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks ( Milgram , 1965 ) .	0	psychology
 4029 . Sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance .	0	psychology
 Social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone .	1	psychology
 This typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled .	0	psychology
 4032 . The field of I - O psychology can be divided into three broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors .	0	psychology
 Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements .	1	psychology
 In addition , once employees are hired , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train , evaluate , and respond to those evaluations .	0	psychology
 4035 . Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising , management , and personnel selection .	0	psychology
 In 1903 , Scott published two books : The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising .	0	psychology
 4038 . Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing .	0	psychology
 Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers .	0	psychology
 In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled , The Principles of Scientific Management ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4041 . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different .	0	psychology
 Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group .	0	psychology
 4044 . Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos , Native Americans , European Americans ) .	1	psychology
 What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups ?	0	psychology
 4047 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .	1	psychology
 Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4050 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .	0	psychology
 A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .	1	psychology
 4053 . These groups serve as our in - groups .	0	psychology
 An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .	1	psychology
 A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .	1	psychology
 4056 . This often happens by blaming an out - group for the problem .	0	psychology
 Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out - group when the in - group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .	1	psychology
 4059 . Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .	1	psychology
 In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .	1	psychology
 4062 . Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying ( APA , 2010 ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied ( Olweus , 1993 ) :	0	psychology
 4065 . Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .	0	psychology
 The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .	1	psychology
 Instead , they just watch what is happening .	0	psychology
 4068 . Research suggests there are many other reasons .	0	psychology
 Altruism is people ’s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .	1	psychology
 In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4071 . Once we form relationships with people , we desire reciprocity .	0	psychology
 Reciprocity is the give and take in relationships .	1	psychology
 We contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well .	0	psychology
 4074 . Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages .	0	psychology
 4077 . One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory .	0	psychology
 According to social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( Rusbult & Van Lange , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 4080 . You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview .	0	psychology
 As you can imagine , most research is concerned with the employer ’s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too .	0	psychology
 4083 . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin : An employer can not discriminate based on skin color , hair texture , or other immutable characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in hiring , benefits , promotions , or termination of employees .	1	psychology
 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights Act ; it prohibits job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and termination ) discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required .	1	psychology
 4086 . Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology .	0	psychology
 In organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization .	1	psychology
 In this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different styles of management , different styles of leadership , organizational culture , and teamwork .	0	psychology
 4089 . Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business ’s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees .	1	psychology
 Industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those staying ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation packages ) , and how retained employees are supported .	0	psychology
 4092 . A significant portion of I - O research focuses on management and human relations .	0	psychology
 Douglas McGregor ( 1960 ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior .	1	psychology
 His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .	0	psychology
 4095 . Bass ( 1985 ) popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles .	0	psychology
 In transactional leadership , the focus is on supervision and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments ( i.e. , transactions ) .	1	psychology
 Transactional leaders maintain the status quo : They are managers .	1	psychology
 4098 . Each company and organization has an organizational culture .	0	psychology
 Organizational culture encompasses the values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its employees .	1	psychology
 It is how an organization is run , how it operates , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence .	0	psychology
 4101 . The U.S .	0	psychology
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( n.d . ) provides the following description of sexual harassment :	0	psychology
 4104 . Whereas the two other areas of I - O psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work station , information displays , and the local environment , such as lighting .	1	psychology
 In the United States , human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering ; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth ( psychologist and engineer ) and her husband Frank Gilbreth ( engineer ) .	0	psychology
 4107 . These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .	0	psychology
 For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .	1	psychology
 Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .	0	psychology
 4110 . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .	0	psychology
 A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail .	1	psychology
 A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .	0	psychology
 4113 . A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .	0	psychology
 But when stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating , or what Selye termed distress ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .	1	psychology
 People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .	0	psychology
 4116 . Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .	0	psychology
 Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4119 . The general adaptation syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of three stages : ( 1 ) alarm reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of exhaustion ( Selye , 1936 ; 1976 ) .	0	psychology
 Alarm reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon .	1	psychology
 During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .	0	psychology
 4122 . What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?	0	psychology
 The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis .	0	psychology
 When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .	0	psychology
 4125 . The sociocultural perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background .	1	psychology
 For example , José is an 18-year - old Hispanic male from a traditional family .	0	psychology
 4128 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .	0	psychology
 They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	0	psychology
 4131 . Potential stressors do not always involve major life events .	0	psychology
 Daily hassles — the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , rush hour traffic , lost keys , obnoxious coworkers , inclement weather , arguments with friends or family)—can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( Kanner , Coyne , Schaefer , & Lazarus , 1981 ) .	0	psychology
 4134 . This helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high .	0	psychology
 About 40%–60 % of individuals relapse , which means they return to abusing drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement ( National Institute on Drug Abuse [ NIDA ] , 2008 ) .	1	psychology
 4137 . In this section , we will discuss stress and illness .	0	psychology
 As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky ( 1998 ) describes ,	0	psychology
 4140 . In addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job .	0	psychology
 This situation is referred to as immunosuppression , the decreased effectiveness of the immune system .	1	psychology
 When people experience immunosuppression , they become susceptible to any number of infections , illness , and diseases .	0	psychology
 4143 . Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division , which includes growth and proliferation of new cells , thereby leading to more rapid aging ( Sapolsky , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 In the study , researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children ( Epel et al . , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children .	0	psychology
 4146 . These individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush .	1	psychology
 According to Friedman and Rosenman , these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern ; those who are more relaxed and laid - back were characterized as Type B ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In a sample of Type As and Type Bs , Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs ( Friedman & Rosenman , 1959 ) .	0	psychology
 4149 . Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .	1	psychology
 A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic - depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .	0	psychology
 4152 . The therapist informs the client about confidentiality , fees , and what to expect in treatment .	0	psychology
 Confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so .	1	psychology
 During the intake , the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals .	0	psychology
 4155 . Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The couple may be dating , partnered , engaged , or married .	0	psychology
 4158 . In strategic family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time .	1	psychology
 Typically , the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member ’s problem ( Madanes , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 4161 . Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century , but it has since waned significantly in popularity .	0	psychology
 4164 . Freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — maybe positive feelings , maybe negative feelings .	0	psychology
 Freud called this transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the psychoanalyst .	1	psychology
 For example , Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst .	0	psychology
 4167 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .	1	psychology
 In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .	1	psychology
 4170 . Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .	0	psychology
 Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior .	1	psychology
 Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors , such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking .	0	psychology
 4173 . Sometimes , it ’s too impractical , expensive , or embarrassing to re - create anxiety- producing situations , so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears .	0	psychology
 Virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a trauma and stressor - related disorder ( Gerardi , Cukor , Difede , Rizzo , & Rothbaum , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 4176 . Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s .	0	psychology
 His initial focus was on depression and how a client ’s self - defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( Beck , Rush , Shaw , & Emery , 1979 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4179 . Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential .	1	psychology
 So it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self - aware and accepting of themselves .	0	psychology
 In contrast to psychoanalysis , humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts .	0	psychology
 4182 . In active listening , the therapist acknowledges , restates , and clarifies what the client expresses .	0	psychology
 Therapists also practice what Rogers called unconditional positive regard , which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are .	1	psychology
 Rogers ( 1951 ) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness , empathy , and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves , which results in personal growth .	0	psychology
 4185 . As we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is chronic — takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications .	0	psychology
 When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .	0	psychology
 4188 . These efforts may include avoiding , minimizing , or distancing oneself from the problem , or positive comparisons with others ( “ I ’m not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ Now that I ’ve been fired , I can sleep in for a few days ” ) .	0	psychology
 In some cases , emotion - focused coping strategies involve reappraisal , whereby the stressor is construed differently ( and somewhat self - deceptively ) without changing its objective level of threat ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks , “ This will give me a great chance to network with others , ” is using reappraisal .	0	psychology
 4191 . Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear .	0	psychology
 Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) .	0	psychology
 4194 . Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks , there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( Salmon , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 It is well - established that exercise , both of long ( aerobic ) and short ( anaerobic ) duration , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4197 . The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( Benson & Proctor , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s .	0	psychology
 Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals .	1	psychology
 4200 . Measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do .	0	psychology
 Studies show that average national happiness scores ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to six key variables : per capita gross domestic product ( GDP , which reflects a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life expectancy , freedom from perceived corruption in government and business , and generosity ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4203 . Qualities that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - lasting , or trait - like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4206 . By the 18th century , people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders .	1	psychology
 Often these people were kept in windowless dungeons , beaten , chained to their beds , and had little to no contact with caregivers .	0	psychology
 4209 . This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States .	0	psychology
 It started the process of deinstitutionalization , the closing of large asylums , by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally .	1	psychology
 In 1955 , there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals ( Torrey , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 4212 . However , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are diagnosed early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school .	0	psychology
 These conditions are listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , academic , and intellectual functioning ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 In this section , we will discuss two such disorders : attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism .	0	psychology
 4215 . The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder ; individuals diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary , but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication , such as talking only about their special interests ( Wing , Gould , & Gillberg , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 However , because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger ’s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder , the DSM-5 does not include it , which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ Asperger ’s Syndrome Dropped , ” 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work independently as adults .	0	psychology
 6719 . She also wrote a newspaper column and had a weekly radio show .	0	government
 Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors , although in the early 1960s , Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines , and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States .	0	government
 She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady , complete with a news reporter , Liz Carpenter , as her press secretary .	0	government
 6722 . She shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy .	0	government
 Her successor , Rosalynn Carter , attended several cabinet meetings and pushed for the ratification of the ERA as well as for legislation addressing mental health issues ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6725 . The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success .	0	government
 Her successors , Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty - first century and Michelle Obama in the second , returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies : Laura Bush advocated literacy and education , while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise .	0	government
 Nevertheless , the public and political profiles of first ladies remain high , and in the future , the president ’s spouse will have the opportunity to use that unelected position to advance policies that might well be less controversial and more appealing than those pushed by the president .	0	government
 6728 . The president may not be able to appoint key members of his or her administration without Senate confirmation , but he or she can demand the resignation or removal of cabinet officers , high - ranking appointees ( such as ambassadors ) , and members of the presidential staff .	0	government
 During Reconstruction , Congress tried to curtail the president ’s removal power with the Tenure of Office Act ( 1867 ) , which required Senate concurrence to remove presidential nominees who took office upon Senate confirmation .	0	government
 Andrew Johnson ’s violation of that legislation provided the grounds for his impeachment in 1868 .	0	government
 6731 . Many of the most famous executive orders have come in times of war or invoke the president ’s authority as commander - in - chief , including Franklin Roosevelt ’s order permitting the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942 and Harry Truman ’s directive desegregating the armed forces ( 1948 ) .	0	government
 The most famous presidential proclamation was Abraham Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation ( 1863 ) , which declared slaves in areas under Confederate control to be free ( with a few exceptions ) .	1	government
 6734 . Finally , presidents have also used the line - item veto and signing statements to alter or influence the application of the laws they sign .	0	government
 A line - item veto is a type of veto that keeps the majority of a spending bill unaltered but nullifies certain lines of spending within it .	1	government
 While a number of states allow their governors the line - item veto ( discussed in the chapter on state and local government ) , the president acquired this power only in 1996 after Congress passed a law permitting it .	0	government
 6737 . But the advent of civil service reform in the 1880s systematically deprived presidents of that option and reduced its scope and effectiveness .	0	government
 Although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for proposals , such as the Office of Legislative Liaison with Congress , it is often left to the chief executive to offer incentives and rewards .	0	government
 Some of these are symbolic , like private meetings in the White House or an appearance on the campaign trail .	0	government
 6740 . Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies . The youth and glamour that John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline brought to the White House in the early 1960s ( a ) helped give rise to the legend of “ one brief shining moment that was Camelot ” after Kennedy ’s presidency was cut short by his assassination on November 22 , 1963 .	0	government
 Despite a tainted legacy , President Richard Nixon gives his trademark “ V for Victory ” sign as he leaves the White House on August 9 , 1974 ( b ) , after resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal .	0	government
 6743 . It distinguishes which are matters of original jurisdiction and which are for appellate jurisdiction .	0	government
 Under original jurisdiction , a case is heard for the first time , whereas under appellate jurisdiction , a court hears a case on appeal from a lower court and may change the lower court ’s decision .	1	government
 The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .	0	government
 6746 . The first session of the first U.S. Congress laid the framework for today ’s federal judicial system , established in the Judiciary Act of 1789 .	0	government
 Although legislative changes over the years have altered it , the basic structure of the judicial branch remains as it was set early on : At the lowest level are the district courts , where federal cases are tried , witnesses testify , and evidence and arguments are presented .	0	government
 6749 . But it took years for the Court to get to that point , and it faced a number of setbacks on the way to such recognition .	0	government
 In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit . Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .	0	government
 However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .	0	government
 In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it . In an atmosphere of perceived weakness , the first chief justice , John Jay , an author of The Federalist Papers and appointed by President George Washington , resigned his post to become governor of New York and later declined President John Adams ’s offer of a subsequent term . Associated Press .	0	government
 6755 . The Supreme Court found itself in the middle of a dispute between the outgoing presidential administration of John Adams and that of incoming president ( and opposition party member ) Thomas Jefferson .	0	government
 It was an interesting circumstance at the time , particularly because Jefferson and the man who would decide the case — John Marshall — were themselves political rivals .	0	government
 6761 . With each ACA case it has decided , the Supreme Court has served as the umpire , upholding the law and some of its provisions on one hand , but ruling some aspects of it unconstitutional on the other .	0	government
 Both supporters and opponents of the law have claimed victory and faced defeat .	0	government
 6764 . Societal traditions , public opinion , and politics have often stood in the way of the full expansion of rights and liberties to different groups , and not everyone has agreed that these rights should be expanded as they have been by the courts .	0	government
 Schools were long segregated by race until the Court ordered desegregation in Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , and even then , many stood in opposition and tried to block students at the entrances to all - white schools . Brown v.

 6773 . State courts really are the core of the U.S. judicial system , and they are responsible for a huge area of law .	0	government
 Most crimes and criminal activity , such as robbery , rape , and murder , are violations of state laws , and cases are thus heard by state courts .	0	government
 State courts also handle civil matters ; personal injury , malpractice , divorce , family , juvenile , probate , and contract disputes and real estate cases , to name just a few , are usually state - level cases .	0	government
 6776 . From an individual ’s perspective , the dual court system has both benefits and drawbacks .	0	government
 On the plus side , each person has more than just one court system ready to protect his or her rights .	0	government
 6782 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .	0	government
 Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .	0	government
 6788 . Certainly , court interpretations can change as times and circumstances change — and as the courts themselves change when new judges are selected and take their place on the bench .	0	government
 For example , the membership of the Supreme Court had changed entirely between Plessey v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) , which brought the doctrine of “ separate but equal ” and Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , which required integration . Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 ( 1896 ) ; Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) .	0	government

 The 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was especially important because the next president is likely to choose three justices . Presidential nominations to the Supreme Court sometimes go awry , as illustrated by the failed nominations of Robert Bork ( a ) , Douglas Ginsburg ( b ) , and Harriet Miers ( c ) .	0	government
 6809 . With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .	0	government

 These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ” This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .	0	government
 6857 . Despite the national government ’s power to pass and fund policy that affects lower - level governments , states still have gained considerable headway since the late twentieth century .	0	government
 For instance , with the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996 , known as the welfare reform bill , states were given great discretion over the provision of welfare .	1	government
 The federal government reduced its level of monetary support for the program and , in exchange , the states gained more authority over its implementation .	0	government

 They expect political officials to be honest in their dealings with others , put the interests of the people they serve above their own , and commit to improving the area they represent .	0	government
 6866 . According to Elazar , the individualist political culture originated with settlers from non - Puritan England and Germany .	0	government
 The first settlements were in the mid - Atlantic region of New York , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey and diffused into the middle portion of the United States in a fairly straight line from Ohio to Wyoming .	0	government

 However , the country ’s many bureaucrats or civil servants , the individuals who work in the bureaucracy , fill necessary and even instrumental roles in every area of government : from high - level positions in foreign affairs and intelligence collection agencies to clerks and staff in the smallest regulatory agencies .	1	government
 They are hired , or sometimes appointed , for their expertise in carrying out the functions and programs of the government .	0	government

 The common argument that bureaucratic regulation smothers capitalist innovation was especially powerful in the Cold War environment of the 1960s , 70s , and 80s .	0	government
 But as long as voters felt they were benefiting from the bureaucratic expansion , as they typically did , the political winds supported continued growth .	0	government
 6926 . As the size of the federal government and its bureaucracy grew following the Great Depression and the Roosevelt reforms , many became increasingly concerned that the Pendleton Act prohibitions on political activities by civil servants were no longer strong enough .	0	government
 As a result of these mounting concerns , Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939—or the Political Activities Act .	0	government
 The main provision of this legislation prohibits bureaucrats from actively engaging in political campaigns and from using their federal authority via bureaucratic rank to influence the outcomes of nominations and elections .	1	government
 6929 . Civil servants receive pay based on the U.S. Federal General Schedule .	0	government
 A pay schedule is a chart that shows salary ranges for different levels ( grades ) of positions vertically and for different ranks ( steps ) of seniority horizontally .	1	government
 The Pendleton Act of 1883 allowed for this type of pay schedule , but the modern version of the schedule emerged in the 1940s and was refined in the 1990s .	0	government

 When Congress drafted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 , it specifically included rights for federal whistleblowers , those who publicize misdeeds committed within a bureaucracy or other organization , and set up protection from reprisals .	1	government
 The act ’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi - juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints , conducts investigations into possible abuses , and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out . Campbell , “ Civil Service Reform , ” 100 .	1	government
 Over time , Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts .	0	government

 The story of the HCERA , which expanded and improved some provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , also known as Obamacare , is a complicated tale of insider politics in which the Democratic Party was able to enact sweeping health care and higher education reforms over fierce Republican opposition ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Some people laud the HCERA as an example of getting things done in the face of partisan gridlock in Congress ; others see it a case of government power run amok .	0	government
 6950 . The president can also implement or change policy through an executive order , which offers instructions about how to implement law under his or her discretion ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 Finally , policy changes can come as a result of court actions or opinions , such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ( 1954 ) , which formally ended school segregation in the United States . Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) .	1	government
 6953 . During the Great Depression of the 1930s , the United States created a set of policies and programs that constituted a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs , their homes , and their savings ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the federal government began programs like the Work Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps to combat unemployment and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation to refinance Depression - related mortgage debts .	0	government
 As the effects of the Depression eased , the government phased out many of these programs .	0	government
 6956 . Some people in the United States argue that the self - monitoring and self - regulating incentives provided by the existence of private goods mean that sound public policy requires very little government action .	0	government
 Known as libertarians , these individuals believe government almost always operates less efficiently than the private sector ( the segment of the economy run for profit and not under government control ) , and that government actions should therefore be kept to a minimum .	1	government
 6959 . By the beginning of the twentieth century , led by the Progressives , the United States had begun to search for ways to govern large businesses that had managed to distort market forces by monopolizing the supply of goods .	0	government
 And , largely as a result of the Great Depression , people wanted ways of developing and protecting public goods that were fairer and more equitable than had existed before .	0	government
 These forces and events led to the increased regulation of public and common goods , and a move for the public sector — the government — to take over of the provision of many toll goods .	0	government

 The nation ’s experiences during the depression of 1896 and the Great Depression of the 1930s also led to more robust regulatory policies designed to improve the transparency of financial markets and prevent monopolies from forming .	0	government
 6968 . By the 1960s , social welfare had become a major function of the federal government — one to which most public policy funds are devoted — and had developed to serve several overlapping functions .	0	government
 First , social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of equity in a democratic political system based on competitive , free - market economics .	1	government
 During the Great Depression , many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low - income levels plaguing society could threaten the stability of democracy , as was happening in European countries like Germany and Italy .	0	government
 6971 . Social Security addresses these concerns with three important tools .	0	government
 First and best known is the retirement benefit .	0	government
 6974 . While Social Security was designed to provide cash payments to sustain the aged and disabled , Medicare and Medicaid were intended to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to health care .	0	government
 Medicare , like Social Security , is an entitlement program funded through payroll taxes .	0	government
 Its purpose is to make sure that senior citizens and retirees have access to low - cost health care they might not otherwise have , because most U.S. citizens get their health insurance through their employers .	0	government
 6977 . One of the reasons the news media are so enduring is that citizens have a range of opinions on public policy , and they are very interested in debating how a given change would improve their lives or the country ’s .	0	government
 But despite their interests , most people do little more than vote or occasionally contribute to a political campaign .	0	government
 A few people , however , become policy advocates by actively working to propose or maintain public policy .	0	government
 6980 . Both the Congress and the president have tried to reduce the bias in policy analysis by creating their own theoretically nonpartisan policy branches .	0	government
 In Congress , the best known of these is the Congressional Budget Office , or CBO .	0	government
 Authorized in the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act , the CBO was formally created in 1975 as a way of increasing Congress ’s independence from the executive branch .	0	government
 6983 . On a national level , policy implementation can be either top - down or bottom - up .	0	government
 In top - down implementation , the federal government dictates the specifics of the policy , and each state implements it the same exact way .	1	government
 In bottom - up implementation , the federal government allows local areas some flexibility to meet their specific challenges and needs . Daniel Mazmanian and Paul Sabatier .	1	government
 6986 . Finally , laissez - faire proponents felt that keeping government out of the business of business would create an automatic cycle of economic growth and contraction .	0	government
 Contraction phases in which there is no economic growth for two consecutive quarters , called recessions , would bring business failures and higher unemployment .	1	government
 But this condition , they believed , would correct itself on its own if the government simply allowed the system to operate .	0	government
 6989 . The desire of Keynesians to create a minimal level of aggregate demand , coupled with a Depression - era preference to promote social welfare policy , led the president and Congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into two broad categories : mandatory and discretionary ( see [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Of these , mandatory spending is the larger , consisting of about $ 2.3 trillion of the projected 2015 budget , or roughly 57 percent of all federal expenditures.“Mandatory Spending in 2015 : An Infographic , ” 6 January 2016 . www.cbo.gov/publication/51111 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government

 6110 . Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .	0	government
 In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .	1	government
 However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .	0	government
 In particular , the concept of “ contemporary community standards ” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place ; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive .	0	government
 6113 . Free expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials .	0	government
 This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent , such as American Nazis and the vehemently anti - gay Westboro Baptist Church , whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror ( [ link]).National Socialist Party of America v.

 Despite acknowledging a common - law individual right to keep and bear arms , in 1876 the Supreme Court declined , in United States v. Cruickshank , to intervene to ensure the states would respect it . United States v. Cruickshank , 92 U.S. 542 ( 1876 ) .	0	government
 6119 . v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .	0	government
 Because the District of Columbia is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments .	0	government
 Two years later , in McDonald v. Chicago , the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision ( 5–4 ) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states , meaning that state regulation of firearms might , in some circumstances , be unconstitutional .	1	government
 In 2015 , however , the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco ’s strict gun control laws to remain in place , suggesting that — as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment — the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute ( [ link]).Richard Gonzales , “ Supreme Court Rejects NRA Challenge to San Francisco Gun Rules , ” National Public Radio , 8 June 2015 . http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412917394/supreme-court-rejects-nra-challenge-to-s-f-gun-rules ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government

 The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising .	0	government
 6128 . The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for violating federal law , even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action .	0	government
 For example , in the early 1990s , several Los Angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist Rodney King during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court , but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating King ’s civil rights .	0	government
 6131 . The final provision of the Fifth Amendment has little to do with crime at all .	0	government
 The takings clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation . ” This provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit .	0	government
 For example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as clothing , housing , education , or food .	0	government

 The Sixth Amendment contains the provisions that govern criminal trials ; in full , it states :	1	government
 6137 . The Seventh Amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes ; as noted earlier , these are disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused .	1	government

 The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed . Elizabeth Lopatto , “ How Many Innocent People Are Sentenced To Death ? , ” Forbes , 29 April 2014 . http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethlopatto/2014/04/29/how-many-innocent-people-are-sentenced-to-death/#6e9ae5175cc1 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 For example , Claude Jones was executed for murder based on 1990-era DNA testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his ; however , with better DNA testing technology , it was later found to be that of the victim .

 Perhaps as a result of this and other cases , seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007 .	0	government
 As of 2015 , nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases , and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death . See , for example , “ States With and Without the Death Penalty , ” Death Penalty Information Center , http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .	0	government

Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights , scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common - law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century : a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life , particularly within the bounds of the home .	1	government
 For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) .	0	government

Casey in 1992 , in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe ’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test , which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “ substantial obstacle[s ] ” ( undue burdens ) to women seeking an abortion . Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 ( 1992 ) .	1	government
 Thus , the court upheld some state restrictions , including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion , parental consent ( or , if not possible for some reason such as incest , authorization of a judge ) for minors , and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion .	0	government
 Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden .	0	government
 6152 . In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .	0	government
 Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .	0	government
 Most European countries , at least on paper , have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance , perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes .	0	government
 6155 . Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise , the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed .	0	government
 In these cases , the courts are applying the rational basis test .	0	government
 That is , as long as there ’s a reason for treating some people differently that is “ rationally related to a legitimate government interest , ” the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable . Cornell University Law School : Legal Information Institute .	1	government
 6158 . Discrimination against members of racial , ethnic , or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts , which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases .	0	government
 Under strict scrutiny , the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group — the law or action can be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve the goal in question , and that it is the “ least restrictive means ” available to achieve that goal . Johnson v. California , 543 U.S. 499 ( 2005 ) .	0	government
 In other words , if there is a non - discriminatory way to accomplish the goal in question , discrimination should not take place .	0	government

To override the southern states’ actions , lawmakers in Congress proposed two amendments to the Constitution designed to give political equality and power to former slaves ; once passed by Congress and ratified by the necessary number of states , these became the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .	0	government
 The Fourteenth Amendment , in addition to including the equal protection clause as noted above , also was designed to ensure that the states would respect the civil liberties of freed slaves .	0	government

 6176 . In states where the voting rights of poor whites were less of a concern , another tool for disenfranchisement was the poll tax ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 Although de jure segregation , segregation mandated by law , had ended on paper , in practice , few efforts were made to integrate schools in most school districts with substantial black student populations until the late 1960s .	1	government

 In 1962 , Congress proposed what later became the Twenty - Fourth Amendment , which banned the poll tax in elections to federal ( but not state or local ) office ; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964 .	1	government
 Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when , in the case of Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections , the Supreme Court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional . Harper v.

 6191 . Newer , grassroots organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , and Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) challenged the NAACP ’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal - focused strategy .	0	government
 These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .	0	government
 The strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , or the refusal to obey an unjust law , had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma Gandhi to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s .	0	government
 6194 . Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v. Virginia).Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) .	1	government
 While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated .	0	government
 In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E. D. Nixon ’s home was bombed , and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama . See Lynne Olson .	0	government

 In a 5–4 decision , the justices in the majority said the formula for placing states on the VRA preclearance list was outdated and reached into the states’ authority to oversee elections . Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 States and counties on the preclearance list were released , and Congress was told to design new guidelines for placing states on the list .	0	government
 6356 . Finally , some voters may view non - voting as a means of social protest or may see volunteering as a better way to spend their time .	0	government
 Younger voters are more likely to volunteer their time rather than vote , believing that serving others is more important than voting .

 Possibly related to this choice is voter fatigue .	0	government
 In many states , due to our federal structure with elections at many levels of government , voters may vote many times per year on ballots filled with candidates and issues to research .	0	government

 In 1896 , the Republican Party spent about $ 16 million overall , which includes William McKinley ’s $ 6–7 million campaign expenses . Jonathan Bernstein , “ They Spent What on Presidential Campaigns ? , ” Washington Post , 20 February , 2012 .	0	government
 This raised enough eyebrows that several key politicians , including Theodore Roosevelt , took note .	0	government
 After becoming president in 1901 , Roosevelt pushed Congress to look for political corruption and influence in government and elections . Jaime Fuller , “ From George Washington to Shaun McCutcheon : A Brief - ish History of Campaign Finance Reform , ” Washington Post , 3 April 2014 .	0	government
 Shortly after , the Tillman Act ( 1907 ) was passed by Congress , which prohibited corporations from contributing money to candidates running in federal elections .	1	government
 Other congressional acts followed , limiting how much money individuals could contribute to candidates , how candidates could spend contributions , and what information would be disclosed to the public . Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 ; Hatch Act of 1939 ; Taft - Hartley Act of 1947	0	government
 6362 . By using loopholes in the laws , political parties and political action committees donated large sums of money to candidates , and new reforms were soon needed .	0	government
 Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russ Feingold ( former D - WI ) cosponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain – Feingold Act .	0	government
 McCain – Feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties , which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence .	1	government
 6365 . The court ruling also allowed corporations to place unlimited money into super PACs , or Independent Expenditure - Only Committees .	0	government
 These organizations can not contribute directly to a candidate , nor can they strategize with a candidate ’s campaign .	0	government
 6368 . Senator or House member , some states use the top - two primary method .	0	government
 A top - two primary , sometimes called a jungle primary , pits all candidates against each other , regardless of party affiliation .	1	government
 The two candidates with the most votes become the final candidates for the general election .	0	government
 6371 . It was , however , one of the worst occurrences .	0	government
 States have been frontloading since the 1976 presidential election , with the problem becoming more severe in the 1992 election and later . Josh Putnam , “ Presidential Primaries and Caucuses by Month ( 1976 ) , ” Frontloading HQ ( blog ) , February 3 , 2009 , http://frontloading.blogspot.com/2009/02/1976-presidential-primary-calendar.html .	0	government
 6374 . The general election campaign period occurs between mid - August and early November .	0	government
 These elections are simpler than primaries and conventions , because there are only two major party candidates and a few minor party candidates .	0	government
 6377 . In forty - eight states and the District of Columbia , the candidate who wins the most votes in November receives all the state ’s electoral votes , and only the electors from that party will vote .	1	government
 This is often called the winner - take - all system .	0	government
 In two states , Nebraska and Maine , the electoral votes are divided .	0	government
 6380 . During a presidential election year , members of Congress often experience the coattail effect , which gives members of a popular presidential candidate ’s party an increase in popularity and raises their odds of retaining office .	1	government
 During a midterm election year , however , the president ’s party often is blamed for the president ’s actions or inaction .	0	government
 6383 . There are more candidates vying to become their party ’s nominee , and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one .	0	government
 In the 2016 presidential election , Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options , including Mike Huckabee , Donald Trump , Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , John Kasich , Chris Christie , Carly Fiorina , Ben Carson , and more .	0	government
 ( Huckabee , Christie , and Fiorina dropped out relatively early . )	0	government
 6386 . Another source of negative ads is from groups outside the campaigns .	0	government
 Sometimes , shadow campaigns , run by political action committees and other organizations without the coordination or guidance of candidates , also use negative ads to reach voters .	0	government
 Even before the Citizens United decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates , shadow campaigns existed .	0	government
 6389 . Over time , however , ads became more negative and manipulative .	0	government
 In reaction , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , or McCain – Feingold , included a requirement that candidates stand by their ad and include a recorded statement within the ad stating that they approved the message .	0	government
 Although ads , especially those run by super PACs , continue to be negative , candidates can no longer dodge responsibility for them .	0	government
 6392 . In essence , this is retrospective voting , but it requires little of the voter .	0	government
 In congressional and local elections , incumbents win reelection up to 90 percent of the time , a result called the incumbency advantage .	1	government
 What contributes to this advantage and often persuades competent challengers not to run ?	0	government
 6395 . Finally , the recall is one of the more unusual forms of direct democracy ; it allows voters to decide whether to remove a government official from office .	1	government
 All states have ways to remove officials , but removal by voters is less common .	0	government
 6398 . First , while citizens of these states believe smoking or consuming marijuana should be legal , the U.S. government does not .	0	government
 The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , passed by Congress in 1970 , declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act .	1	government
 And despite Holder ’s statement , a 2013 memo by James Cole , the deputy attorney general , reminded states that marijuana use is still illegal . James M. Cole , “ Memorandum for All United States Attorneys , ” U.S .	0	government
 6401 . Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders arrived in Seattle on August 8 , 2015 , to give a speech at a rally to promote his presidential campaign .	0	government
 Instead , the rally was interrupted — and eventually co - opted — by activists for Black Lives Matter ( [ link]).Dan Merica , “ Black Lives Matter Protesters Shut Down Sanders Event in Seattle , ” CNN , 10 August 2015 .	0	government
 Why did the group risk alienating Democratic voters by preventing Sanders from speaking ?	0	government

 Public relations is not a neutral information form .	0	government
 6407 . Walter Cronkite , reporting from Vietnam , had a loyal following .	0	government
 In a broadcast following the Tet Offensive in 1968 , Cronkite expressed concern that the United States was mired in a conflict that would end in a stalemate.“Walter Cronkite ’s ‘ We Are Mired in Stalemate’ Broadcast , February 27 , 1968 ” Digital History , http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/vietnam/cronkite.cfm ( November 29 , 2015 ) .	0	government

 Economists like Tyler Cowen , a professor at George Mason University , are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology , and those who do not .	0	economic
 According to Cowen author of the recent book , Average Is Over : Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation , this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills , and ultimately , in wages and global standards of living .	0	economic
 4619 . Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .	1	economic
 Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .	1	economic
 4622 . After all , according to the Federal Register , the median household income for a family of four was $ 102,552 in New Jersey and $ 57,132 in Mississippi in 2013 , and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states .	0	economic
 The poverty line is based on cash income , which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non - cash form , like Medicaid ( health care for low - income individuals and families ) and food aid .	1	economic
 Also , low - income families can qualify for federal housing assistance .	0	economic
 4625 . At the other extreme of the budget constraint line , an individual would work zero hours , earn zero income , but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure .	0	economic
 At point A on the budget constraint line , by working 40 hours a week , 50 weeks a year , the utility - maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $ 16,000.Now suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two children $ 18,000 in income .	0	economic
 This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $ 18,000 .	0	economic
 4628 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .	1	economic
 This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .	0	economic
 4631 . [ link ] illustrates that the earned income tax credits , child tax credits , and the TANF program all cost the federal government money — either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues .	0	economic
 CTC stands for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit . Real Federal Spending on CTC , EITC , and TANF , 1975 - 2013EITC increased from more than $ 20 billion in 2000 to over an estimated $ 50 billion by 2013 , far exceeding estimated 2013 outlays in the CTC ( Child Tax Credits ) and TANF of over $ 20 billion and $ 10 billion , respectively .	0	economic

 4634 . The safety net includes a number of other programs : government - subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for children from low - income families ; the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) , which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns ; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , which provides help with home heating bills ; housing assistance , which helps pay the rent ; and Supplemental Security Income , which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor .	1	economic
 4640 . Income is a flow of money received , often measured on a monthly or an annual basis ; wealth is the sum of the value of all assets , including money in bank accounts , financial investments , a pension fund , and the value of a home .	1	economic
 In calculating wealth all debts must be subtracted , such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit cards .	0	economic
 4643 . Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .	0	economic
 The effective income tax , which is total taxes paid divided by total income ( all sources of income such as wages , profits , interest , rental income , and government transfers such as veterans’ benefits ) , was much lower .	1	economic
 The effective tax paid by the top 1 % of householders was 20.4 % , while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes , because of provisions like the earned income tax credit .	0	economic
 4649 . This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product , but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms .	0	economic
 At the higher union wage Wu , the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium .	0	economic
 4652 . Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries , the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were .	0	economic
 It is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers , including the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) ; the Service Employees International Union ; and the National Education Association .	1	economic
 The membership of each of these unions is listed in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4658 . A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal .	0	economic
 For example , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same .	1	economic
 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .	1	economic
 4664 . One disruptive effect , as just noted , is that immigration weighted toward low - skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low - skill workers .	0	economic
 A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each 10 % rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market , high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3 % .	0	economic
 The effects on wages of low - skill workers are not large — perhaps in the range of decline of about 1 % .	0	economic
 4667 . Many economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information , where either the buyer , the seller , or both , are less than 100 % certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold .	1	economic
 Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .	1	economic
 4670 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .	1	economic
 By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .	1	economic
 4676 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .	1	economic
 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 4682 . Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4685 . Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs .	0	economic
 Some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund , and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments .	0	economic
 Other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up .	0	economic
 4688 . Deposit insurance : Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $ 250,000 ( the amount was raised from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 ) if the bank should go bankrupt .	1	economic
 4691 . Some drivers are safer than others .	0	economic
 A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring .	1	economic
 4694 . For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 4697 . However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .	0	economic
 A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided .	1	economic
 In this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare provider , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later .	0	economic

 These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors , including banks , institutions like college endowments , insurance companies that hold financial reserves , and corporate pension funds .	0	economic
 4712 . A corporation is a business that “ incorporates”—that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits ( and losses ) .	1	economic
 Corporations may be private or public , and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded .	0	economic
 4715 . Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	1	economic
 Corporate giants like IBM , AT&T , Ford , General Electric , Microsoft , Merck , and Exxon all have millions of shares of stock .	0	economic
 4718 . Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .	0	economic
 The increase in the value of the stock ( or of any asset ) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain .	1	economic
 4721 . A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners .	0	economic
 Most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales , that do not have publicly issued stock , such as farm products dealer Cargill , the Mars candy company , and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm . When a firm decides to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company .	1	economic
 Shareholders own a public company .	0	economic
 4724 . The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased profitability .	1	economic
 It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .	0	economic
 4730 . Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .	0	economic
 With a CD , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically ranging from a few months to several years .	1	economic
 4733 . A bond is basically an “ I owe you ” note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital ( money ) .	0	economic
 The bond has a face value .	0	economic
 This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .	1	economic
 4736 . The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	1	economic
 This may or may not be the same as the face value .	0	economic

 Broad measures of the stock market , like the ones listed here , tend to move together .	0	economic
 4742 . At the other end of the spectrum , a mutual fund might be quite broad ; at the extreme , some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market .	0	economic
 A mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an index fund .	1	economic
 4745 . Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount .	1	economic
 4748 . A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference .	1	economic
 This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election . In a 1957 work , An Economic Theory of Democracy , the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way : “ It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se .	1	economic
 No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information , or how uncertain he is about which party to support , he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome … He will not even utilize all the free information available , since assimilating it takes time . ” In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two , the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters , who states : “ The chance that one man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election … is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ” The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process : spending .	0	economic

 4757 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .	0	economic
 However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .	0	economic
 HCAN , spending $ 60 million dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014 .	0	economic

A nonprofit watchdog organization , called Citizens against Government Waste , produces an annual report , the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork - barrel spending , focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress , that were passed into law without any public hearings , or that serve only a local purpose .	1	economic
 Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , pork - barrel spending totaled $ 2.7 billion in 2014.Pork - barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor .	1	economic
 For example , if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district , the other members might oppose it .	0	economic
 4763 . This case goes against the theory of the “ median ” voter in a democracy .	0	economic
 The median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences .	1	economic
 If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum .	0	economic

 As the famous British economist Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago : “ [ E]conomic theory , in itself , preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws .	0	economic
 It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions . ” The study of economics is neither politically conservative , nor moderate , nor liberal .	0	economic
 4769 . How large is the U.S. economy ?	0	economic
 The size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year .	1	economic
 The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services — smart phones , cars , music downloads , computers , steel , bananas , college educations , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and summing them into a total dollar value .	0	economic
 4772 . If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .	0	economic
 Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about 15–18 % of GDP , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created .	0	economic
 However , it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption .	0	economic
 4775 . Since the early 1980s , imports have typically exceeded exports , and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years .	0	economic
 Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 4778 . They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year .	0	economic
 Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting , in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production .	1	economic
 For example , imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer , and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires .	0	economic
 4781 . One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product ( GNP ) .	0	economic
 GDP includes only what is produced within a country ’s borders .	0	economic
 4787 . GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy .	1	economic
 We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter .	0	economic
 4790 . The generally upward long - term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short - term declines .	0	economic
 A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 4793 . [ link ] lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900 .	0	economic
 The highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the trough .	1	economic
 Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 4796 . To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies , it is necessary to convert to a “ common denominator ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency .	1	economic
 Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	0	economic

 In macroeconomics , the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function .	1	economic
 4814 . The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads ( also called infrastructure ) .	1	economic
 Again , greater physical capital implies more output .	0	economic
 4817 . To obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link](a ) by the population .	0	economic
 This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita ( that is , GDP divided by population ) .	1	economic
 The inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link](b ) .	0	economic

 The economist Alexander Gerschenkron ( 1904–1978 ) gave this phenomenon a memorable name : “ the advantages of backwardness . ” Of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living .	0	economic
 He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up .	0	economic
 4826 . It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking , often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment .	0	economic
 Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force .	0	economic
 4829 . Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate .	0	economic
 This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job .	1	economic
 4832 . One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census .	0	economic
 But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly .	0	economic
 Instead , workers in these countries are engaged in short - term work , subsistence activities , and barter .	0	economic
 4835 . From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle .	0	economic
 In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity .	1	economic
 At the equilibrium wage ( We ) , the equilibrium quantity ( Qe ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers .	0	economic
 4838 . Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few .	0	economic
 A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone .	0	economic
 4841 . The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave .	1	economic
 The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay .	0	economic
 4844 . Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?	0	economic
 Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment .	1	economic
 4847 . Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment .	0	economic
 The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills .	1	economic
 4850 . Moreover , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too .	0	economic
 The second - to - last row of [ link ] shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six - fold from 1970 to 2014 .	0	economic
 4853 . Step 1 .	0	economic
 Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods .	0	economic
 The general equation for percentage changes between two years , whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation , is :	0	economic
 4856 . The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .	0	economic
 The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	1	economic
 4859 . If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether .	0	economic
 Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living .	1	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature is a must - read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated .	0	economic
 4862 . It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	0	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 4865 . The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms : they are right after World War I and World War II .	0	economic
 However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s .	1	economic
 ( Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . )	0	economic
 4868 . Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists .	0	economic
 Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation .	0	economic
 One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ” Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree.”The Land of Funny Money	0	economic
 4871 . If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning .	0	economic
 4874 . One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension .	0	economic
 Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement .	1	economic
 For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans .	0	economic
 4877 . High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker .	1	economic
 Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages .	0	economic
 4880 . When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed .	1	economic
 An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 4883 . Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well .	0	economic
 An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 Often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM , compared to a fixed - rate loan .	0	economic
 4886 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 4889 . At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries .	0	economic
 The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year .	0	economic
 This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % .	0	economic
 4892 . Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers .	0	economic
 4895 . Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .	0	economic
 For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) .	1	economic
 The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market .	0	economic
 4898 . As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too .	0	economic
 The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital .	0	economic
 In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments .	0	economic
 4901 . Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country .	0	economic
 Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world .	0	economic
 The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account .	0	economic
 4904 . The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true .	0	economic
 Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital .	0	economic
 4907 . When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health .	0	economic
 But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher .	0	economic
 Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health .	0	economic
 4910 . How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?	0	economic
 Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?	0	economic
 Why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in 2009 ?	0	economic
 4913 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic
 The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall .	0	economic
 1216 . Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .	0	biology
 A horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers .	1	biology
 Five factors account for soil formation : parent material , climate , topography , biological factors , and time . Parent Material	0	biology
 1219 . Animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices , and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation .	0	biology
 Plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root , in an area known as the rhizosphere .	1	biology
 Additionally , leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition .	0	biology
 1222 . In this area , rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface .	0	biology
 The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward , resulting in a dense layer in the soil .	1	biology
 In some soils , the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate .	0	biology
 1225 . Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .	1	biology
 This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase .	0	biology
 Therefore , using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants , as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource , such as natural gas .	0	biology
 1228 . A symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship , with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation .	1	biology
 Fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae ( called lichens ) .	1	biology
 1231 . Plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle : the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage .	0	biology
 The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .	1	biology
 Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .	1	biology
 1234 . The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium .	0	biology
 The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .	1	biology
 The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .	1	biology
 1237 . Each pollen grain has two coverings : the exine ( thicker , outer layer ) and the intine ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The exine contains sporopollenin , a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells .	1	biology
 1240 . During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac . Two of the nuclei — the polar nuclei — move to the equator and fuse , forming a single , diploid central cell .	1	biology
 This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .	0	biology
 1243 . The ovule wall will become part of the fruit .	0	biology
 The integuments , while protecting the megasporangium , do not enclose it completely , but leave an opening called the micropyle .	0	biology
 The micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization .	1	biology
 1246 . In angiosperms , pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower .	1	biology
 In gymnosperms , pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone .	1	biology
 1249 . They visit flowers that are open during the day , are brightly colored , have a strong aroma or scent , and have a tubular shape , typically with the presence of a nectar guide .	0	biology
 A nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees , and not to humans ; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower , thus making the pollination process more efficient .	1	biology
 The pollen sticks to the bees’ fuzzy hair , and when the bee visits another flower , some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower .	0	biology
 1252 . After fertilization , the zygote divides to form two cells : the upper cell , or terminal cell , and the lower , or basal , cell .	0	biology
 The division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor , which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue .	0	biology
 The suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo .	1	biology
 1255 . Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .	0	biology
 Upon germination , enzymes are secreted by the aleurone , a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo .	1	biology
 The enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates , proteins and lipids , the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo .	0	biology
 1258 . The seed , along with the ovule , is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac .	0	biology
 In dicots , the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen .	1	biology
 1261 . In monocots , the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation .	0	biology
 The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .	1	biology
 The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .	1	biology
 1267 . In many seeds , the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate .	0	biology
 Scarification , which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat , is often employed before germination .	1	biology
 Presoaking in hot water , or passing through an acid environment , such as an animal ’s digestive tract , may also be employed .	0	biology
 1270 . An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .	1	biology
 An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .	0	biology
 1273 . Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .	1	biology
 Together , all three are known as the pericarp .	0	biology
 The mesocarp is usually the fleshy , edible part of the fruit ; however , in some fruits , such as the almond , the endocarp is the edible part .	0	biology
 1276 . In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .	1	biology
 The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .	1	biology
 Both are cut at an oblique angle ( any angle other than a right angle ) , placed in close contact with each other , and are then held together [ link ] .	1	biology
 1279 . Micropropagation ( also called plant tissue culture ) is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions [ link ] .	1	biology
 This method allows propagation of rare , endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions , are economically important , or are in demand as disease - free plants .	0	biology
 1282 . The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence , which is marked by several complex biochemical changes .	1	biology
 One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts , which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves .	0	biology
 1285 . This is fused to the animal ’s epidermis .	0	biology
 Ingrowths of the exoskeleton , called apodemes , function as attachment sites for muscles , similar to tendons in more advanced animals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In order to grow , the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering .	0	biology
 1288 . Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal / g , and fat contains about 9 kcal / g .	0	biology
 Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate ( SMR ) in ectotherms .	1	biology
 Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal / day , and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal / day .	0	biology
 1291 . Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .	0	biology
 During hibernation , ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) , while a bear ’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 ° C ( 99 ° F).If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water , it is called estivation .	1	biology
 Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year .	0	biology
 1294 . A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .	1	biology
 1297 . The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral ( or spinal ) cavities .	1	biology
 The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity , which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity , which surrounds the heart .	1	biology
 The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity , which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities .	0	biology
 1300 . Squamous epithelial cells are generally round , flat , and have a small , centrally located nucleus .	0	biology
 The cell outline is slightly irregular , and cells fit together to form a covering or lining .	0	biology
 1303 . The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells , making it appear as though there is more than one layer , as seen in [ link ] .	1	biology
 This is called pseudostratified , columnar epithelia .	0	biology
 This cellular covering has cilia at the apical , or free , surface of the cells .	1	biology
 1306 . Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others .	0	biology
 The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density .	0	biology
 When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers , it has proportionally a less dense matrix .	0	biology
 1309 . Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .	1	biology
 The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 1312 . Compact bone is found in the shaft ( or diaphysis ) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones , while spongy bone is found in the end ( or epiphysis ) of a long bone .	1	biology
 Compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .	1	biology
 1315 . These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures .	0	biology
 Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body .	1	biology
 It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body ’s systems encounter .	0	biology
 1318 . Positive Feedback LoopA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus , possibly accelerating it .	1	biology
 Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies , but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting , or coagulation .	1	biology
 1324 . Omnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal - derived food .	1	biology
 In Latin , omnivore means to eat everything .	0	biology
 1327 . As the word monogastric suggests , this type of digestive system consists of one ( “ mono ” ) stomach chamber ( “ gastric ” ) .	1	biology
 Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in [ link]ab .	0	biology
 1330 . Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes , which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria .	0	biology
 Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .	1	biology
 Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .	0	biology
 1333 . The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach .	1	biology
 The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .	0	biology
 1345 . The large intestine , illustrated in [ link ] , reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material .	1	biology
 The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter .	0	biology
 1348 . The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood .	1	biology
 The liver produces bile , a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum .	1	biology
 1351 . Essential NutrientsWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors , there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food .	1	biology
 These nutrients are termed essential nutrients , meaning they must be eaten , and the body can not produce them .	0	biology
 1354 . Food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules .	0	biology
 The first step in this process is ingestion .	0	biology
 Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth .	1	biology
 1357 . The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides , which are short chains of four to nine amino acids .	1	biology
 In the duodenum , other enzymes — trypsin , elastase , and chymotrypsin — act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides .	0	biology
 Trypsin elastase , carboxypeptidase , and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme .	0	biology
 1360 . The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth .	0	biology
 The first phase of ingestion , called the cephalic phase , is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food .	1	biology
 All aspects — such as sight , sense , and smell — trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices .	0	biology
 1363 . The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times .	1	biology
 1366 . In the duodenum , digestive secretions from the liver , pancreas , and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase .	0	biology
 In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .	1	biology
 Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .	0	biology
 1369 . The nervous system is made up of neurons , specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals , and glia , cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons .	1	biology
 A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire — it transmits a signal from one place to another .	0	biology
 1372 . The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .	1	biology
 An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .	1	biology
 These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons , muscle , or target organs .	0	biology
 1375 . There are several different types of glia with different functions , two of which are shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Astrocytes , shown in [ link]a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS .	1	biology
 They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons , regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid , and provide structural support for synapses .	0	biology
 1378 . Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .	1	biology
 One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .	0	biology
 1381 . Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	0	biology
 Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .	1	biology
 They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid , which serves as a cushion for the brain , moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain , and is a component for the choroid plexus . Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment .	0	biology
 1384 . When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .	0	biology
 At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron .	0	biology
 A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( -55 mV ) .	0	biology
 1387 . Flow of ions through these channels , particularly the Na+ channels , regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon .	1	biology
 This ‘ jumping’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction .	0	biology
 If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon , the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points .	0	biology
 1390 . Na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize .	1	biology
 This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .	0	biology
 Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .	1	biology
 1393 . Long - term potentiation ( LTP ) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection .	1	biology
 LTP is based on the Hebbian principle : cells that fire together wire together .	0	biology
 1396 . The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .	1	biology
 The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .	0	biology
 As the Latin suggests , the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord .	1	biology
 1399 . The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .	0	biology
 1402 . The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .	0	biology
 A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum ( Latin : “ tough body ” ) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other .	1	biology
 Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other , the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant .	0	biology
 1405 . Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .	0	biology
 Two of the parietal lobe ’s main functions are processing somatosensation — touch sensations like pressure , pain , heat , cold — and processing proprioception — the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space .	0	biology
 The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex .	0	biology
 1408 . The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .	1	biology
 It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .	1	biology
 The hippocampus is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1411 . Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland , a pea - sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells .	1	biology
 1414 . The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .	0	biology
 The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain .	1	biology
 1417 . Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord , shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body .	1	biology
 1420 . Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) .	0	biology
 The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .	0	biology
 1423 . Humans have 12 cranial nerves , nerves that emerge from or enter the skull ( cranium ) , as opposed to the spinal nerves , which emerge from the vertebral column .	1	biology
 Each cranial nerve is accorded a name , which are detailed in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1426 . Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly .	0	biology
 In 2012 , an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer ’s disease , and payments for their care are estimated at $ 200 billion .	0	biology
 1429 . Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD)Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .	0	biology
 Like ASD , ADHD is more prevalent in males than females .	0	biology
 1432 . Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime .	0	biology
 While there are several different types of epilepsy , all are characterized by recurrent seizures .	0	biology
 1435 . This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .	0	biology
 In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .	0	biology
 Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system .	0	biology
 1438 . The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system .	0	biology
 This takes place at the sensory receptor , and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential .	1	biology
 How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?	0	biology
 1441 . Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated ( that is , surrounded by a capsule ) or unencapsulated ( a group that includes free nerve endings ) .	1	biology
 A free nerve ending , as its name implies , is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron .	1	biology
 Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin , and they extend into the middle of the epidermis .	0	biology
 1444 . Deeper in the epidermis , near the base , are Ruffini endings , which are also known as bulbous corpuscles .	0	biology
 They are found in both glabrous and hairy skin .	0	biology
 1447 . Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .	0	biology
 Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs .	0	biology
 1450 . Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz ; cats , 60,000 Hz ; bats , 100,000 Hz ; and dolphins 150,000 Hz , and American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ) , a fish , can hear 180,000 Hz .	0	biology
 Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound . Amplitude , or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough , in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds .	0	biology
 1453 . Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	0	biology
 The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	1	biology
 The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .	0	biology
 1456 . The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .	1	biology
 The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .	1	biology
 Here , the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea .	0	biology
 1459 . When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane , it flexes back and forth in a wave - like fashion .	0	biology
 Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane .	0	biology
 1462 . The fluid - filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles .	0	biology
 They are arranged in three spatial planes .	0	biology
 1465 . The photoreceptive cells of the eye , where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs , are located in the retina ( shown in [ link ] ) on the inner surface of the back of the eye .	1	biology
 But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered .	0	biology
 1468 . The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken , changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina .	0	biology
 With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens , and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results .	0	biology
 Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .	0	biology
 1471 . There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina : rods and cones , named for their general appearance as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina .	1	biology
 1474 . Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity .	0	biology
 That is , they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light .	1	biology
 1477 . Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .	1	biology
 The SCN sends information to the pineal gland , which is important in sleep / wake patterns and annual cycles .	0	biology
 1480 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .	1	biology
 1483 . Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons ( neurons with two processes from the cell body ) .	1	biology
 Each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium , and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor - laden , hair - like cilia that trap odorant molecules .	0	biology
 1486 . These are elongated cells with hair - like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Food molecules ( tastants ) are dissolved in saliva , and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli .	1	biology
 The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue , outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent .	0	biology
 1489 . Chemically , these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols ; their chemical names will end in “ -ol ” for alcohols or “ -one ” for ketones .	0	biology
 Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol , which is an estrogen , or female sex hormone , and testosterone , which is an androgen , or male sex hormone .	1	biology
 These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs , respectively .	0	biology
 1492 . Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors .	0	biology
 In this way , even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types , they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors .	0	biology
 1495 . Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes .	0	biology
 Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone , hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription , or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways .	0	biology
 1498 . One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .	0	biology
 When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor , a G - protein that is associated with the receptor is activated ; G - proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane .	1	biology
 When a hormone is not bound to the receptor , the G - protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate , or GDP .	0	biology
 1501 . The term “ humoral ” is derived from the term “ humor , ” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood .	1	biology
 A humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood .	1	biology
 For example , a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin .	0	biology
 1504 . Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones , the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body 's physiology .	0	biology
 Hypothalamic - Pituitary AxisThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain .	1	biology
 1507 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .	1	biology
 This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .	1	biology
 1510 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .	0	biology
 305 . Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light , which is the absorption spectrum .	1	biology
 The graph in [ link ] shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and a type of carotenoid pigment called β - carotene ( which absorbs blue and green light ) .	1	biology
 308 . Both photosystems have the same basic structure ; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place .	0	biology
 Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids .	1	biology
 311 . The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property .	0	biology
 Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation ; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact .	0	biology
 It is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .	0	biology
 314 . Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI , they must be re - energized by PSI , hence , another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna .	0	biology
 That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center ( called P700 ) .	1	biology
 P700 is oxidized and sends a high - energy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH .	0	biology
 317 . That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA .	0	biology
 Recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule .	1	biology
 Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used .	0	biology
" 320 . An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands ."	0	biology
 A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , delivering a signal in the process .	1	biology
 Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 323 . The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse .	1	biology
 A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells .	1	biology
 Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .	0	biology
 326 . Signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals , and they originate from endocrine cells .	1	biology
 ( In the body , many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands , such as the thyroid gland , the hypothalamus , and the pituitary gland . )	0	biology
 329 . Internal receptors , also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors , are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane .	1	biology
 Once inside the cell , many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis ( transcription ) to mediate gene expression .	0	biology
 332 . Ion channel - linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through .	1	biology
 To form a channel , this type of cell - surface receptor has an extensive membrane - spanning region .	0	biology
 335 . Once a ligand binds to a receptor , the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 Continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction .	0	biology
 Signal transduction only occurs with cell - surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis .	0	biology
 338 . After the ligand binds to the cell - surface receptor , the activation of the receptor ’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade .	0	biology
 In a signaling pathway , second messengers , enzymes , and activated proteins interact with specific proteins , which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell ’s environment ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 341 . Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor .	1	biology
 These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins .	0	biology
 344 . Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane , inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers .	1	biology
 Because these molecules are membrane components , they are located near membrane - bound receptors and can easily interact with them .	0	biology
 347 . Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells .	0	biology
 The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors .	1	biology
 Most growth factors bind to cell - surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases .	0	biology
 350 . For example , phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation .	1	biology
 Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase , and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2 + pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell .	0	biology
 353 . Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind .	1	biology
 The secreted autoinducers can be small , hydrophobic molecules such as acyl - homoserine lactone , ( AHL ) or larger peptide - based molecules ; each type of molecule has a different mode of action .	0	biology
 356 . Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells .	0	biology
 Human body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .	0	biology
 A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .	1	biology
 359 . Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes . Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .	1	biology
 362 . The DNA - histone complex is called chromatin .	1	biology
 The beadlike , histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome , and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA .	1	biology
 A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones , and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter , in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix .	0	biology
 365 . The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells .	1	biology
 Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth , DNA replication , and division that produces two identical ( clone ) cells .	0	biology
 368 . The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase ( first gap ) because , from a microscopic aspect , little change is visible .	1	biology
 However , during the G1 stage , the cell is quite active at the biochemical level .	0	biology
 371 . The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle , the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis .	1	biology
 At the center of each animal cell , the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod - like objects , the centrioles , which are at right angles to each other .	1	biology
 Centrioles help organize cell division .	0	biology
 374 . Karyokinesis , also known as mitosis , is divided into a series of phases — prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase — that result in the division of the cell nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Karyokinesis is also called mitosis .	0	biology
 377 . During prometaphase , the “ first change phase , ” many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance .	1	biology
 The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment .	0	biology
 380 . During anaphase , the “ upward phase , ” the cohesin proteins degrade , and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere .	1	biology
 Each chromatid , now called a chromosome , is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached .	0	biology
 383 . The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward , forming a fissure .	1	biology
 This fissure , or “ crack , ” is called the cleavage furrow .	0	biology
 The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts , and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two ( [ link]).In plant cells , a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells .	0	biology
 386 . Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide .	0	biology
 The cell is in a quiescent ( inactive ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle .	1	biology
 Some cells enter G0 temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of G1 .	0	biology
 389 . Tumor Suppressor GenesLike proto - oncogenes , many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous .	0	biology
 Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins , the type of regulators that , when activated , can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division .	1	biology
 The collective function of the best - understood tumor suppressor gene proteins , Rb , p53 , and p21 , is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed .	0	biology
 392 . The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , p53 , and p21 .	0	biology
 Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor - suppressor proteins common in many cells .	1	biology
 395 . After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell , cytoplasmic separation begins .	0	biology
 The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids .	0	biology
 Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .	0	biology
 398 . Most animals and plants are diploid , containing two sets of chromosomes .	1	biology
 In each somatic cell of the organism ( all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells ) , the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome , called homologous chromosomes .	1	biology
 Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as “ body ” cells .	0	biology
 401 . Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis , the same stage names are assigned .	0	biology
 However , because there are two rounds of division , the major process and the stages are designated with a “ I ” or a “ II . ” Thus , meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I , prometaphase I , and so on .	1	biology
 Meiosis II , in which the second round of meiotic division takes place , includes prophase II , prometaphase II , and so on .	1	biology
 404 . In mitosis , homologous chromosomes line up end - to - end so that when they divide , each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair .	0	biology
 The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .	1	biology
 The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .	1	biology
 407 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .	0	biology
 These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .	1	biology
 410 . In some species , cells enter a brief interphase , or interkinesis , before entering meiosis II .	0	biology
 Interkinesis lacks an S phase , so chromosomes are not duplicated .	0	biology
 413 . Fertilization , the joining of two haploid gametes , restores the diploid condition .	1	biology
 There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms : diploid - dominant , in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with most animals including humans ; haploid - dominant , in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with all fungi and some algae ; and alternation of generations , in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group , as with plants and some algae .	1	biology
 416 . Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote .	1	biology
 The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte .	1	biology
 Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores .	0	biology
 419 . Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .	0	biology
 The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring , but we now know that this is not the case .	1	biology
 Mendel was the first researcher to see it .	0	biology
 422 . Plants used in first - generation crosses were called P0 , or parental generation one , plants ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .	0	biology
 425 . In his 1865 publication , Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics , each with two contrasting traits .	0	biology
 A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic .	1	biology
 The characteristics included plant height , seed texture , seed color , flower color , pea pod size , pea pod color , and flower position .	0	biology
 428 . Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .	1	biology
 Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .	1	biology
 The recessive trait does , however , reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring .	0	biology
 431 . For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic , a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic .	0	biology
 Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles .	1	biology
 Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms , but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population .	0	biology
 434 . The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying .	0	biology
 Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene , or locus , have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes .	0	biology
 Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .	0	biology
 437 . The dominant seed color is yellow ; therefore , the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds , respectively .	0	biology
 A Punnett square , devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett , can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies .	1	biology
 To prepare a Punnett square , all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top ( for one parent ) and side ( for the other parent ) of a grid , representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes .	0	biology
 440 . ( Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness . )	0	biology
 This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance , denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype .	1	biology
 The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers .	0	biology
 443 . Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .	0	biology
 All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .	1	biology
 The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild - type allele .	0	biology
 446 . Because of the location of the eye - color gene , reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios .	0	biology
 Males are said to be hemizygous , because they have only one allele for any X - linked characteristic .	1	biology
 Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males .	0	biology
 449 . Mendel ’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote , one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic .	1	biology
 Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype , the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively .	0	biology
 452 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .	1	biology
 The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .	1	biology
 Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants , one that has green , wrinkled seeds ( yyrr ) and another that has yellow , round seeds ( YYRR ) .	0	biology
 455 . That same year , Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Together , these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance , which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance .	1	biology
 458 . Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .	0	biology
 Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .	1	biology
 Morgan and his colleagues , however , found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent ( AaBb × aabb ) , both parental and nonparental cases occurred .	0	biology
 461 . The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans .	0	biology
 A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .	1	biology
 To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 464 . For instance , Jacobsen Syndrome — which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects — is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11 .	1	biology
 Finally , the karyotype can pinpoint translocations , which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome .	1	biology
 Translocations are implicated in certain cancers , including chronic myelogenous leukemia .	0	biology
 467 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .	1	biology
 An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .	1	biology
 Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes .	0	biology
 470 . A chromosome inversion is the detachment , 180 ° rotation , and reinsertion of part of a chromosome .	1	biology
 Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear , or from the action of transposable elements ( special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences ) .	1	biology
 473 . A half century later , British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “ horizontally , ” rather than by descent .	0	biology
 In 1928 , he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation , a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell , thereby changing morphology and physiology .	1	biology
 He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterium that causes pneumonia .	1	biology
 476 . ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .	0	biology
 As the DNA opens up , Y - shaped structures called replication forks are formed .	0	biology
 Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .	0	biology
 479 . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .	1	biology
 Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .	0	biology
 DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 482 . Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .	0	biology
 The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand .	1	biology
 485 . The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I , and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides .	0	biology
 The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA ( that replaced the RNA primer ) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5 ' phosphate end of the other fragment .	1	biology
 488 . In another type of repair mechanism , nucleotide excision repair , enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3 ' and 5 ' ends of the incorrect base ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol .	0	biology
 491 . Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .	1	biology
 Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .	1	biology
 494 . These can be of two types , either transitions or transversions .	0	biology
 Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .	1	biology
 Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .	1	biology
 497 . The discovery of the enzyme telomerase ( [ link ] ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained .	0	biology
 The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built - in RNA template .	1	biology
 It attaches to the end of the chromosome , and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3 ' end of the DNA strand .	0	biology
 500 . In contrast , there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets ( 43 ) , which is far more than the number of amino acids .	0	biology
 Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate .	0	biology
 In other words , a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet .	0	biology
 503 . In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain , three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery .	1	biology
 These triplets are called nonsense codons , or stop codons .	0	biology
 Another codon , AUG , also has a special function .	0	biology
 506 . The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .	1	biology
 Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .	1	biology
 The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .	0	biology
 The only difference is that in mRNA , all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides .	0	biology
 509 . Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .	1	biology
 512 . A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription .	1	biology
 In most cases , promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate .	0	biology
 515 . Rho - independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand .	0	biology
 As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed , it encounters a region rich in C – G nucleotides .	0	biology
 518 . These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome .	0	biology
 For example , the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box ( GGCCAATCT ) at approximately -80 .	0	biology
 This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .	0	biology
 521 . For polynucleotide synthesis to occur , the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome .	0	biology
 This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT , which stands for “ facilitates chromatin transcription . ” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it .	1	biology
 Once the pre - mRNA is synthesized , the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes .	0	biology
 524 . .	0	biology
 The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG ( or rarely , GUG ) , links to a formylated methionine called fMet , and can also bind IF-2 .	1	biology
 Formylated methionine is inserted by	0	biology
 527 . Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A - site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P - site tRNA .	1	biology
 The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase , an RNA - based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit .	1	biology
 The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis , which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor .	0	biology
 530 . While the pre - mRNA is still being synthesized , a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5 ' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage .	0	biology
 This moiety ( functional group ) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation .	1	biology
 533 . If the process errs by even a single nucleotide , the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift , and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional .	0	biology
 The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Introns are removed and degraded while the pre - mRNA is still in the nucleus .	0	biology
 536 . The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors ( epigenetic level ) , when the RNA is transcribed ( transcriptional level ) , when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post - transcriptional level ) , when the RNA is translated into protein ( translational level ) , or after the protein has been made ( post - translational level ) .	1	biology
 539 . coli need amino acids to survive .	0	biology
 Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment .	0	biology
 542 . A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene .	0	biology
 This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind .	1	biology
 When tryptophan is present in the cell , two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor , which changes shape to bind to the trp operator .	0	biology
 545 . coli .	0	biology
 When glucose levels decline in the cell , accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein ( CAP ) , a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars .	1	biology
 When cAMP binds to CAP , the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 548 . If a gene is to be transcribed , the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene .	0	biology
 This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins , called transcription factors , to bind to the promoter region , located just upstream of the gene , and initiate transcription .	0	biology
 If a gene is to remain turned off , or silenced , the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration .	0	biology
 551 . In some eukaryotic genes , there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription .	1	biology
 These regions , called enhancers , are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance .	0	biology
 They can be located upstream of a gene , within the coding region of the gene , downstream of a gene , or may be thousands of nucleotides away .	0	biology
 554 . If the RNA is stable , it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm . Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability .	0	biology
 Proteins , called RNA - binding proteins , or RBPs , can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein - coding region .	1	biology
 These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions , or UTRs .	1	biology
 557 . In addition to RBPs that bind to and control ( increase or decrease ) RNA stability , other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule .	0	biology
 These microRNAs , or miRNAs , are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length .	1	biology
 The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre - miRNAs .	0	biology
 560 . Like transcription , translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process .	0	biology
 In translation , the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex .	1	biology
 The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 563 . The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .	0	biology
 566 . Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete .	1	biology
 These proteins are moved to the proteasome , an organelle that functions to remove proteins , to be degraded ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One way to control gene expression , therefore , is to alter the longevity of the protein .	0	biology
 569 . Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement .	1	biology
 Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood .	0	biology
 572 . Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment , they can be mobilized by an electric field .	0	biology
 Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size , using this charge .	1	biology
 The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments .	0	biology
 575 . Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size .	0	biology
 The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .	0	biology
 578 . Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations ( such as Escherichia coli ) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism , such as antibiotic resistance ( the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics ) .	1	biology
 Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .	0	biology
 581 . Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature .	1	biology
 They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .	0	biology
 584 . Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism .	1	biology
 Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means , which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals ( parents ) , making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent .	1	biology
 587 . The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .	1	biology
 If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .	1	biology
 Bacteria , plants , and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic , medical , agricultural , and industrial purposes .	0	biology
 590 . Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease .	1	biology
 In its simplest form , it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene .	0	biology
 593 . Genomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species .	1	biology
 Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .	1	biology
 The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .	0	biology
 596 . Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes ( similar to a detailed road map ) .	0	biology
 A physical map is a representation of the physical distance , in nucleotides , between genes or genetic markers .	1	biology
 Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome .	0	biology
 599 . Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLP ) , variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) , microsatellite polymorphisms , and the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .	0	biology
 RFLPs ( sometimes pronounced “ rif - lips ” ) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments , which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis .	1	biology
 602 . This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency .	0	biology
 Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs .	1	biology
 The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping .	1	biology
 3246 . The pion must then be captured and , thus , can not be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent violation of mass - energy conservation .	0	physics
 Such particles ( like the pion above ) are called virtual particles , because they can not be directly observed but their effects can be directly observed .	1	physics
 Realizing all this , Yukawa used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion , the particle that carries it .	0	physics
 3249 . He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S. I. Tomonaga for work in QED with its deep implications for particle physics . Why is it that particles called gluons are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when , in The Yukawa Particle and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited , we saw that pions apparently carry that force ?	0	physics
 The answer is that pions are exchanged but they have a substructure and , as we explore it , we find that the strong force is actually related to the indirectly observed but more fundamental gluons .	0	physics
 In fact , all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no substructure .	0	physics
 3255 . Quarks have been mentioned at various points in this text as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive club of truly elementary particles .	0	physics
 Note that an elementary or fundamental particle has no substructure ( it is not made of other particles ) and has no finite size other than its wavelength .	1	physics
 This does not mean that fundamental particles are stable — some decay , while others do not .	0	physics
 3258 . Originally , three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then - known mesons and baryons .	0	physics
 These quark flavors are named up ( u ) , down ( d ) , and strange ( s ) .	0	physics
 All quarks have half - integral spin and are thus fermions .	0	physics
 3264 . The analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good — the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances , but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale , and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable .	0	physics
 The search for a correct theory linking the forces , called the Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) , is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics .	0	physics
 Frontiers of Physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology , on the opposite end of the distance scale .	0	physics

 3267 . It is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles , but the theory ( quantum chromodynamics or QCD ) is very self - consistent .	0	physics
 So successful have QCD and the electroweak theory been that , taken together , they are called the Standard Model .	0	physics
 Advances in knowledge are expected to modify , but not overthrow , the Standard Model of particle physics and forces .	0	physics

 3279 . By 1916 , he had laid the foundation of general relativity , again almost on his own .	0	physics
 Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations — doing this is to perform a thought experiment .	1	physics
 [ link ] illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field .	0	physics
 3285 . Gravitational wavesIf a massive object distorts the space around it , like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond , then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond .	0	physics
 Gravitational waves are mass - created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity .	1	physics
 Since gravity is by far the weakest force , extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves .	0	physics
 3288 . This , until recently , was a question of whether there is enough gravitation to stop the expansion of the universe .	0	physics
 In the past few years , it has become a question of the combination of gravitation and what is called the cosmological constant .	0	physics
 The cosmological constant was invented by Einstein to prohibit the expansion or contraction of the universe .	0	physics
 At the time he developed general relativity , Einstein considered that an illogical possibility .	0	physics
 3291 . This means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , analogous to circumnavigating the Earth .	0	physics
 In between these two is a flat ( zero curvature ) universe .	0	physics
 The recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat , and will expand forever .	0	physics
 3297 . The simple laws of physics apply , of course , but complex systems may reveal patterns that simple systems do not .	0	physics
 The emerging field of complexity is devoted to the study of complex systems , including those outside the traditional bounds of physics .	1	physics

 A bow wake , such as the one in [ link ] , is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed .	1	physics
 Water waves spread out in circles from the point where created , and the bow wake is the familiar V - shaped wake trailing the source .	0	physics

 The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals , especially those related to the division of resources within a nation .	1	government
 5810 . Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States , and many Americans tend to equate democracy , a political system in which people govern themselves , with capitalism .	1	government
 In theory , a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled , for good or bad , by government .	0	government
 5813 . Therefore , some goods are provided by the government .	0	government
 Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods .	1	government
 Two such public goods are national security and education .	0	government

 Unlike public goods , which all people may use without charge , common goods are in limited supply .	1	government
 5819 . A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people .	1	government
 In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .	1	government
 Instead , they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people .	0	government

 It would not become the law of the land until all thirteen states had approved it .	0	government
 5873 . Following the Declaration of Independence , each of the thirteen states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people , although the right to vote was limited to free ( white ) men , and the property requirements for voting differed among the states .	0	government
 Each state had a governor and an elected legislature .	0	government
 5876 . The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , already recognized by many , became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers , led by Daniel Shays .	1	government
 Known as Shays’ Rebellion , the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts , who called upon the national government for assistance .	0	government

 Two of the delegates , Alexander Hamilton and James Madison , requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .	0	government

 Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .	1	government
 Thus , smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states .	0	government
 5888 . The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .	0	government
 In Article I , ten sections describe the structure of Congress , the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress , the length of Congressional terms , and the powers of Congress .	0	government
 The national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation , slavery , and national power .	0	government
 5891 . Although debates over slavery and representation in Congress occupied many at the convention , the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful .	0	government
 The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .	0	government
 They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .	0	government
 5894 . The strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers’ creation of a federal system of government .	0	government
 In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .	1	government
 Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .	1	government
 5897 . Although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty , the supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution proclaimed that the Constitution , laws passed by Congress , and treaties made by the federal government were “ the supreme Law of the Land . ” In the event of a conflict between the states and the national government , the national government would triumph .	0	government
 Furthermore , although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution , Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed .	0	government
 5900 . But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states .	0	government

 5930 . The Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments , ratified at the end of the Civil War , changed the lives of African Americans who had been held in slavery .	0	government
 The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .	1	government
 The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .	1	government
 5933 . The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .	1	government
 After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .	1	government
 5936 . The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War .	0	government
 The Twenty - Sixth Amendment reduced the voting age from twenty - one to eighteen .	1	government
 Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them .	0	government
 5939 . Federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government , each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution . See John Kincaid .	1	government
 1975 . 5942 .	0	government
 Division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In contrast to federalism , a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government , where significant authority is concentrated .	1	government
 Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .	0	government
 5945 . The Constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of U.S. federalism .	0	government
 Some delineate the scope of national and state power , while others restrict it .	0	government
 5948 . What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .	0	government
 The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .	1	government
 5951 . Like the federal government , the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus , passing bills of attainder , or enacting ex post facto laws .	0	government
 Furthermore , the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution , due process of law , or the equal protection of the laws .	1	government
 Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .	0	government
 5954 . The movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades .	0	government
 In light of Baehr v. Lewin , a 1993 ruling in which the Hawaii Supreme Court asserted that the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates . Baehr v. Lewin .	1	government
 1993 . 5960 .	0	government
 Although the data reflect 2013 results , the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years .	0	government
 For the federal government , 47 percent of 2013 revenue came from individual income taxes and 34 percent from payroll taxes , which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax .	0	government
 5966 . When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .	0	government
 However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .	0	government
 5969 . The Supreme Court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property .	0	government
 Under the supremacy clause of Article VI , legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws .	1	government
 As the court observed , “ the government of the Union , though limited in its powers , is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws , when made in pursuance of the constitution , form the supreme law of the land . ” Maryland ’s action violated national supremacy because “ the power to tax is the power to destroy . ” This second ruling established the principle of national supremacy , which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government .	1	government
 5972 . First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .	1	government
 Second , because the federal Licensing Act of 1793 , which regulated coastal commerce , was a constitutional exercise of Congress ’s authority under the commerce clause , federal law trumped the New York State license - monopoly law that had granted Ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license .	1	government
 As Marshall pointed out , “ the acts of New York must yield to the law of Congress.”Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .	0	government
 5975 . A nullification crisis emerged in the 1830s over President Andrew Jackson ’s tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 .	0	government
 Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .	0	government
 South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .	0	government
 5981 . Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .	1	government
 But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .	0	government
 What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .	1	government
 The defeat of the South had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways .	0	government
 5984 . The late 1870s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of U.S. federalism .	0	government
 Under dual federalism , the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction .	1	government
 Like the layers of a cake , the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined .	0	government
 5990 . The Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Between 1929 and 1933 , the national unemployment rate reached 25 percent , industrial output dropped by half , stock market assets lost more than half their value , thousands of banks went out of business , and the gross domestic product shrunk by one - quarter . Nicholas Crafts and Peter Fearon .	0	government
 5993 . The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .	0	government
 The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .	0	government
 The court ’s obstructionist position infuriated Roosevelt , leading him in 1937 to propose a court - packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy , thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments .	0	government
 5996 . The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .	0	government
 Before the Great Depression , the government offered little in terms of financial aid , social benefits , and economic rights .	0	government
 After the New Deal , it provided old - age pensions ( Social Security ) , unemployment insurance , agricultural subsidies , protections for organizing in the workplace , and a variety of other public services created during Roosevelt ’s administration .	1	government
 6002 . Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras , most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded .	0	government
 The Social Security Act of 1935 , which created federal subsidies for state - administered programs for the elderly ; people with handicaps ; dependent mothers ; and children , gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels .	1	government
 The unemployment insurance program , also created by the Social Security Act , requires states to provide jobless benefits , but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits .	1	government
 6005 . New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .	1	government
 During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .	0	government
 The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution .	0	government
 6008 . However , many would say that the years since the 9/11 attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power .	0	government
 The creation of the Department of Homeland Security federalized disaster response power in Washington , and the Transportation Security Administration was created to federalize airport security .	1	government
 Broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the Faith - Based Initiative and No Child Left Behind ( during the George W. Bush administration ) and the Affordable Care Act ( during Barack Obama ’s administration ) .	0	government
 6011 . The national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the Articles of Confederation when it provided states with land grants .	0	government
 In the first half of the 1800s , land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states .	0	government
 6014 . Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .	1	government
 Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .	1	government
 Finally , recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants .	0	government
 6017 . However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .	0	government
 The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .	0	government
 Under the AFDC , the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount .	0	government
 6020 . For example , Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination .	1	government
 Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .	1	government
 6023 . A new piece of legislation aims to take this approach further .	0	government
 The 2015 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act , HR 50 , passed the House early in 2015 before being referred to the Senate , where it waits committee consideration . U.S .	0	government
 Congress .	0	government
 6026 . The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .	1	government
 The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .	1	government
 6029 . “ Discrediting ‘ Self Deportation’ as Immigration Policy , ” February 6 . http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/discrediting-%E2%80%9Cself-deportation%E2%80%9D-immigration-policy The federal government filed suit to block the Arizona law , contending that it conflicted with federal immigration laws .	0	government
 Arizona ’s law has also divided society , because some groups , like the Tea Party movement , have supported its tough stance against illegal immigrants , while other groups have opposed it for humanitarian and human - rights reasons ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 According to a poll of Latino voters in the state by Arizona State University researchers , 81 percent opposed this bill . Daniel González .	0	government
 6032 . The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling . Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .	0	government
 All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .	0	government
 That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .	0	government
 6035 . Edith Windsor , the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor , has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same - sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections .	1	government
 In 2007 , after having lived together since the late 1960s , Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada , where same - sex marriage was legal .	0	government

 In the final analysis , same - sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court , which took up the issue again when it heard Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 .	1	government
 6041 . Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) was established in 1980 by a woman whose thirteen - year - old daughter had been killed by a drunk driver .	0	government
 The organization lobbied state legislators to raise the drinking age and impose tougher penalties , but without success .	1	government
 6044 . The strategy anti - abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping .	0	government
 In their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision making abortion legal nationwide , anti - abortion advocates initially targeted Congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation . Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .	1	government
 Lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators , where their advocacy efforts have been more successful .	0	government
 By 2015 , for example , thirty - eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor ’s decision to have an abortion , forty - six states allowed individual health - care providers to refuse to participate in abortions , and thirty - two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the woman ’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .	0	government
 6047 . Federalism also comes with drawbacks .	0	government
 Chief among them are economic disparities across states , race - to - the - bottom dynamics ( i.e. , states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations ) , and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance .	1	government
 6050 . Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the deaths of African Americans during interactions with police .	0	government
 Many people were deeply troubled by the revelations of Edward Snowden ( [ link ] ) that U.S. government agencies are conducting widespread surveillance , capturing not only the conversations of foreign leaders and suspected terrorists but also the private communications of U.S. citizens , even those not suspected of criminal activity .	0	government
 6053 . The idea that Americans — indeed , people in general — have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence .	0	government
 In writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Thomas Jefferson drew on the ideas of John Locke to express the colonists’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects .	0	government
 It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists’ liberties .	0	government
 6056 . Indeed , the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens , based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors .	0	government
 In Article I , Section 9 , the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways : prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder , prohibiting ex post facto laws , and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus .	0	government
 6059 . Finally , the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common - law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained .	1	government
 Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .	0	government
 6062 . The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .	0	government
 Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .	0	government
 84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .	0	government
 6065 . The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .	0	government
 One of the Anti - Federalists , Brutus , whom most scholars believe to be Robert Yates , wrote : “ The powers , rights , and authority , granted to the general government by this Constitution , are as complete , with respect to every object to which they extend , as that of any state government — It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness — Life , liberty , and property , are under its controul [ sic ] .	0	government
 There is the same reason , therefore , that the exercise of power , in this case , should be restrained within proper limits , as in that of the state governments.”Constitution Society , “ To the Citizens of the State of New - York , ” http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus02.htm ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process .	0	government
 6068 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .	0	government
 In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .	1	government
 Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”	0	government
 6071 . Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 .	0	government
 Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters .	0	government
 6074 . ( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .	0	government
 Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .	0	government
 In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another . Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .	1	government
 More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .	1	government
 6077 . Beginning in 1897 , the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states , even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does — or at all .	0	government
 This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly .	0	government
 When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures , the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional .	0	government
 6080 . Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .	0	government
 In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	1	government
 6083 . The first of these two freedoms is known as the establishment clause .	0	government
 Congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state - sponsored religion ( this now includes the states too ) .	1	government
 6086 . But some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed .	0	government
 For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens .	1	government
 They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons .	0	government
 6089 . To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .	0	government
 However , the Supreme Court ruled in Gillette v. United States that to claim to be a conscientious objector , a person must be opposed to serving in any war , not just some wars . Gillette v. United States , 401 U.S. 437 ( 1971 ) .	1	government
 6092 . In 1990 , the Supreme Court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the Sherbert test in Employment Division v. Smith , more popularly known as “ the peyote case.”Employment Division , Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872 ( 1990 ) .	0	government
 This case involved two men who were members of the Native American Church , a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments .	1	government
 After being arrested for possession of peyote , the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic .	0	government
 6095 . Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .	0	government
 Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .	1	government
 Based in part on the federal RFRA , the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby ’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business’ owners , because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby ’s employees ( e.g. , paying for them directly ) .	0	government
 6098 . Americans who vocally supported the communist cause or opposed the war often found themselves in jail .	0	government
 In Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned for doing so , arguing that recommending that people disobey the law was tantamount to “ falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic ” and thus presented a “ clear and present danger ” to public order . Schenck v. United States , 249 U.S. 47 ( 1919 ) .	1	government
 Similarly , communists and other revolutionary anarchists and socialists during the Red Scare after the war were prosecuted under various state and federal laws for supporting the forceful or violent overthrow of government .	0	government
 This general approach to political speech remained in place for the next fifty years .	0	government
 6101 . He was arrested , charged with “ desecration of a venerated object ” ( among other offenses ) , and eventually convicted of that offense .	0	government
 However , in 1989 , the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment and found the law , as applied to flag desecration , to be unconstitutional . Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397 ( 1989 ) .	1	government
 6104 . In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	1	government
 This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers . New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) .	0	government
 These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military .	0	government
 More specifically , the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 .	1	government
 Daniel Ellsberg famously released passages of the Papers to the press to show that the United States had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing Cambodia and Laos among other deeds while lying to the American public about doing so .	0	government
 5806 . The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs .	0	government
 Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation , secure national borders , and the safety and well - being of citizens .	0	government

 The government of the United States can best be described as a republic , or representative democracy .	0	government
 A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people . In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .	1	government
 5821 . However , in representative governments like the United States , minority rights are protected : people can not be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be .	0	government
 For example , let ’s say American society decided that atheists , people who do not believe that God exists , were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country .	0	government

 These groups include such entities as environmental advocates , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses .	0	government
 5833 . The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .	1	government
 Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .	1	government

 5845 . Americans aged 18–29 were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older Americans .	0	government
 A 2015 poll of more than three thousand young adults by Harvard University ’s Institute of Politics revealed that only 22 percent claimed to be politically engaged , and fewer than 10 percent said that they belonged to any type of political organization or had volunteered for a political campaign .	0	government

 Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues .	0	government
 Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’s latent preferences or beliefs .	0	government
 Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time .	0	government
 5851 . Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .	0	government
 5854 . People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property .	1	government
 Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract .	0	government
 Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it , the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms .	0	government
 5857 . All this began to change in 1763 when the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France came to an end , and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America .	0	government
 The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain , and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France .	0	government
 5860 . The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .	0	government
 The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .	1	government
 5863 . New York : Free Press , 95 - 96 .	0	government
 This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party .	0	government
 Today , many who do not agree with the positions of the Democratic or the Republican Party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the Tea Party ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 5866 . In May 1775 , delegates met again in the Second Continental Congress .	0	government
 By this time , war with Great Britain had already begun , following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and British troops at Lexington and Concord , Massachusetts .	0	government
 5869 . Drafted by Thomas Jefferson , the Declaration of Independence officially proclaimed the colonies’ separation from Britain .	1	government
 In it , Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion .	0	government
 5872 . Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing .	0	government
 Thus , a confederation was created — an entity in which independent , self - governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense .	1	government
 Fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another , however , the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government .	0	government
 5875 . One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes .	0	government
 To avoid any perception of “ taxation without representation , ” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes .	0	government
 5878 . In 1786 , Virginia and Maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in Annapolis , Maryland , for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 However , only five states sent representatives .	0	government
 5881 . Fifty - five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 for the meeting that became known as the Constitutional Convention .	0	government
 Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful .	0	government
 5884 . Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .	1	government
 5887 . The Constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles .	0	government
 The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .	0	government
 5890 . The Three - Fifths Compromise , illustrated in [ link ] , resolved the impasse , although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone .	0	government
 For purposes of Congressional apportionment , slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population , including free African Americans and 60 percent ( three - fifths ) of their enslaved population .	0	government
 5893 . Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 Thus , Congress can pass laws , but its power to do so can be checked by the president , who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law .	0	government
 Later , in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison , the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws , a process called judicial review .	1	government
 5896 . All powers not expressly given to the national government , however , were intended to be exercised by the states .	1	government
 These powers are known as reserved powers ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Thus , states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce ( commerce within the borders of a state ) and marriage .	0	government
 5899 . This approach to ratification was an unusual one .	0	government
 Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states , changes to the nation ’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures .	0	government
 5902 . John Adams and Thomas Jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the Constitution .	0	government
 In the following excerpt ( reproduced as written ) from a letter dated March 15 , 1789 , after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen , Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution :	0	government
 5905 . Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .	0	government
 Although some Anti - Federalists , like Patrick Henry , were wealthy , most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “ the middling sort . ” This was certainly the fear of Melancton Smith , a New York merchant and landowner , who believed that power should rest in the hands of small , landowning farmers of average wealth who “ are more temperate , of better morals and less ambitious than the great.”Isaac Krannick .	0	government
 1999 . 5908 .	0	government
 Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .	0	government
 5911 . An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .	0	government
 Similarly , Jay reminded New Yorkers in Federalist No .	0	government
 2 that union had been the goal of Americans since the time of the Revolution .	0	government
 5914 . Because these men would be members of a “ transient ” body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state , they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the “ heats and ferments ” of the voters .	0	government
 Indeed , Hamilton argued in Federalist No .	0	government
 70 , instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant , Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many .	0	government
 5917 . Responding to charges by Anti - Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals , the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens .	0	government
 James Madison , a member of Congress from Virginia , took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution .	0	government
 5920 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .	1	government
 Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .	0	government
 For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .	0	government
 5923 . Other liberties , however , do not derive from British precedents .	0	government
 The protections for religion , speech , the press , and assembly that are granted by the First Amendment did not exist under English law .	0	government
 ( The right to petition the government did , however . )	0	government
 5926 . The Supreme Court , for example , has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right .	1	government
 The Tenth Amendment , one of the first submitted to the states for ratification , ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution .	1	government
 This guarantee protects states’ reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage , divorce , and intrastate transportation and commerce , and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety .	0	government
 5929 . In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .	0	government
 The Twenty - Second Amendment , added in 1955 , limits the president to two terms in office , and the Twenty - Seventh Amendment , first submitted for ratification in 1789 , regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress .	1	government
 5932 . When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s , many that had allowed free , property - owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men .	0	government
 The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .	1	government
 After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .	1	government
 5935 . The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .	1	government
 The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .	1	government
 Many southern states had used a poll tax , a tax placed on voting , to prevent poor African Americans from voting .	0	government
 5938 . American federalism also seeks to balance the forces of decentralization and centralization .	0	government
 We see decentralization when we cross state lines and encounter different taxation levels , welfare eligibility requirements , and voting regulations , to name just a few .	0	government
 5941 . In the United States , conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts , with the U.S. Supreme Court being the final arbiter .	0	government
 The resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government , as illustrated recently when the Supreme Court ruled that states can not interfere with the federal government ’s actions relating to immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 In other instances , a Supreme Court ruling can erode that autonomy , as demonstrated in the 1940s when , in United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , the Court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states , a function previously handled exclusively by the states . United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , 315 U.S. 110 ( 1942 ) .	0	government
 5944 . In a confederation , authority is decentralized , and the central government ’s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments .	0	government
 Under the Articles of Confederation ( the first constitution of the United States ) , states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak .	1	government
 Because states were reluctant to give up any of their power , the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt , ending commercial disputes among states , negotiating trade agreements with other countries , and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country .	0	government
 5947 . Cambridge , MA : Harvard University Press .	0	government
 However , when it came time to ratify the Constitution , a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states .	0	government
 What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .	0	government
 The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .	0	government
 5950 . The most important restriction Section 9 places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty .	0	government
 Specifically , the government can not suspend the writ of habeas corpus , which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person ’s detention is legal ; pass a bill of attainder , a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial ; or enact an ex post facto law , which criminalizes an act retroactively .	0	government
 The Bill of Rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions , ensuring that the government can not encroach on personal freedoms .	0	government
 5953 . Various constitutional provisions govern state - to - state relations .	0	government
 Article IV , Section 1 , referred to as the full faith and credit clause or the comity clause , requires the states to accept court decisions , public acts , and contracts of other states .	0	government
 Thus , an adoption certificate or driver ’s license issued in one state is valid in any other state .	0	government
 5956 . Scores of states considered legislation and ballot initiatives on the question .	0	government
 The federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor struck down the part of DOMA that outlawed federal benefits . United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 That move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states .	0	government
 In 2014 , the Supreme Court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states , all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts .	0	government
 5959 . State and local government figures are estimated .	0	government
 Two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early 1900s .	0	government
 First , the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 authorized Congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population , a burdensome provision that Article I , Section 9 , had imposed on the national government . Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co. , 158 U.S. 601 ( 1895 ) .	0	government
 With this change , the federal government ’s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend . The second development regulates federal grants , that is , transfers of federal money to state and local governments .	0	government
 These transfers , which do not have to be repaid , are designed to support the activities of the recipient governments , but also to encourage them to pursue federal policy objectives they might not otherwise adopt .	0	government
 5962 . In 2009 , President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , which provided immediate economic - crisis management assistance such as helping local and state economies ride out the Great Recession and shoring up the country ’s banking sector .	1	government
 A total of $ 274.7 billion in grants , contracts , and loans was allocated to state and local governments under the ARRA.Dilger , “ Federal Grants to State and Local Governments , ” 4 .	0	government
 The bulk of the stimulus funds apportioned to state and local governments was used to create and protect existing jobs through public works projects and to fund various public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance . James Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote .	0	government
 5965 . For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .	0	government
 Although Thomas Jefferson , Washington ’s secretary of state , staunchly opposed Hamilton ’s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument , Hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation .

 5968 . Were states allowed to tax federal property ?	0	government
 In McCulloch v. Maryland , Chief Justice John Marshall ( [ link ] ) argued that Congress could create a national bank even though the Constitution did not expressly authorize it . McCulloch v. Maryland , 17 U.S. 316 ( 1819 ) .	0	government
 Under the necessary and proper clause of Article I , Section 8 , the Supreme Court asserted that Congress could establish “ all means which are appropriate ” to fulfill “ the legitimate ends ” of the Constitution .	0	government
 In other words , the bank was an appropriate instrument that enabled the national government to carry out several of its enumerated powers , such as regulating interstate commerce , collecting taxes , and borrowing money .	0	government
 5971 . Gibbons lost in New York state courts and appealed .	0	government
 Chief Justice Marshall delivered a two - part ruling in favor of Gibbons that strengthened the power of the national government .	0	government
 First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .	0	government
 5974 . When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .	1	government
 In effect , these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification — that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional . W .	0	government
 Kirk Wood .	0	government
 5977 . South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .	0	government
 The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833 , authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws .	0	government
 The prospect of military action coupled with the passage of the Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 ( which lowered tariffs over time ) led South Carolina to back off , ending the nullification crisis .	0	government
 5980 . The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War .	0	government
 Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .	0	government
 But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .	0	government
 What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .	0	government
 5983 . Second , Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union ; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .	0	government
 In sum , after the Civil War the power balance shifted toward the national government , a movement that had begun several decades before with McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) and Gibbons v. Odgen ( 1824 ) .	0	government
 5986 . New York : Routledge .	0	government
 To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry , Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 , which created the Interstate Commerce Commission .	1	government
 Three years later , national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce ( Figure 03_02_Commerce ) .	1	government
 In the early stages of industrial capitalism , federal regulations were focused for the most part on promoting market competition rather than on addressing the social dislocations resulting from market operations , something the government began to tackle in the 1930s . Eisner , The American Political Economy ; Stephen Skowronek .	0	government
 5989 . For example , New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897 , which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week .	1	government
 In Lochner v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional , on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 ( 1905 ) .	0	government
 In other words , the right to sell and buy labor is a “ liberty of the individual ” safeguarded by the Constitution , the court asserted .	0	government
 The federal government also took up the issue of working conditions , but that case resulted in the same outcome as in the Lochner case . Hammer v. Dagenhart , 247 U.S. 251 ( 1918 ) .	0	government
 5992 . The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .	0	government
 The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .	0	government
 5995 . In National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones and Laughlin Steel , National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones & Laughlin Steel , 301 U.S. 1 ( 1937 ) .	0	government
 for instance , the Supreme Court ruled the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 constitutional , asserting that Congress can use its authority under the commerce clause to regulate both manufacturing activities and labor - management relations .	1	government
 The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .	0	government
 5998 . In the 1960s , President Lyndon Johnson ’s administration expanded the national government ’s role in society even more .	0	government
 Medicaid ( which provides medical assistance to the indigent ) , Medicare ( which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled ) , and school nutrition programs were created .	1	government
 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ( 1965 ) , the Higher Education Act ( 1965 ) , and the Head Start preschool program ( 1965 ) were established to expand educational opportunities and equality ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6001 . Finally , laws were passed to promote urban renewal , public housing development , and affordable housing .	0	government
 In addition to these Great Society programs , the Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) and the Voting Rights Act ( 1965 ) gave the federal government effective tools to promote civil rights equality across the country .	0	government
 6004 . During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon ( 1969–1974 ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1981–1989 ) , attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization — that is , to restore states’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past .	0	government
 New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .	0	government
 During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .	0	government
 6007 . Several Supreme Court rulings also promoted new federalism by hemming in the scope of the national government ’s power , especially under the commerce clause .	0	government
 For example , in United States v. Lopez , the court struck down the Gun - Free School Zones Act of 1990 , which banned gun possession in school zones . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	1	government
 It argued that the regulation in question did not “ substantively affect interstate commerce . ” The ruling ended a nearly sixty - year period in which the court had used a broad interpretation of the commerce clause that by the 1960s allowed it to regulate numerous local commercial activities . See Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898 ( 1997 ) .	0	government
 6010 . Morton Grodzins coined the cake analogy of federalism in the 1950s while conducting research on the evolution of American federalism .	0	government
 Until then most scholars had thought of federalism as a layer cake , but according to Grodzins the 1930s ushered in “ marble - cake federalism ” ( [ link ] ) : “ The American form of government is often , but erroneously , symbolized by a three - layer cake .	1	government
 6013 . Medicaid and the food stamp program are examples of categorical grants .	0	government
 Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .	1	government
 Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .	0	government
 6016 . President Clinton vetoed the legislation .	0	government
 However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .	0	government
 The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .	1	government
 6019 . Unfunded mandates are federal laws and regulations that impose obligations on state and local governments without fully compensating them for the administrative costs they incur .	1	government
 The federal government has used mandates increasingly since the 1960s to promote national objectives in policy areas such as the environment , civil rights , education , and homeland security .	0	government
 6022 . The widespread use of federal mandates in the 1970s and 1980s provoked a backlash among state and local authorities , which culminated in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act ( UMRA ) in 1995 .	0	government
 The UMRA ’s main objective has been to restrain the national government ’s use of mandates by subjecting rules that impose unfunded requirements on state and local governments to greater procedural scrutiny .	0	government
 6025 . The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .	1	government
 The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .	0	government
 6028 . Arizona has been one of the states at the forefront of immigration federalism .	0	government
 In 2010 , it passed Senate Bill 1070 , which sought to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in the state that they would return to their native country , a strategy referred to as “ attrition by enforcement.”Michele Waslin .	0	government

 In 2012 , in Arizona v. United States , the Supreme Court affirmed federal supremacy on immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law — namely , those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation , making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers , and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers .	0	government
 The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling . Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .	0	government
 All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .	0	government
 That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .	0	government
 6034 . By 2006 , two years after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize marriage equality , twenty - seven states had passed constitutional bans on same - sex marriage .	0	government
 In United States v. Windsor , the Supreme Court changed the dynamic established by DOMA by ruling that the federal government had no authority to define marriage .	0	government
 The Court held that states possess the “ historic and essential authority to define the marital relation , ” and that the federal government ’s involvement in this area “ departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.”United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 6037 . The Windsor case gave federal judges the moment of clarity from the U.S. Supreme Court that they needed .	0	government
 James Esseks , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s ( ACLU ) Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & AIDS Project , summarizes the significance of the case as follows : “ Part of what ’s gotten us to this exciting moment in American culture is not just Edie ’s lawsuit but the story of her life .	0	government
 The love at the core of that story , as well as the injustice at its end , is part of what has moved America on this issue so profoundly.”James Esseks .	0	government
 6040 . The 2014 court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same - sex marriage in thirty states .	0	government
 And in 2015 the Supreme Court gave same - sex marriage a constitutional basis of right nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges .	0	government
 In sum , as the immigration and marriage equality examples illustrate , constitutional disputes have arisen as states and the federal government have sought to reposition themselves on certain policy issues , disputes that the federal courts have had to sort out .	0	government

 However , the federal government ’s ability to defend the voting rights of citizens suffered a major setback when the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .	0	government
 No longer are the nine states with histories of racial discrimination in their voting processes required to submit plans for changes to the federal government for approval .	0	government
 6052 . Civil rights , on the other hand , are guarantees that government officials will treat people equally and that decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than race , gender , or other personal characteristics .	0	government
 Because of the Constitution ’s civil rights guarantee , it is unlawful for a school or university run by a state government to treat students differently based on their race , ethnicity , age , sex , or national origin .	0	government
 6055 . The Constitution as written in 1787 did not include a Bill of Rights , although the idea of including one was proposed and , after brief discussion , dismissed in the final week of the Constitutional Convention .	0	government
 The framers of the Constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties , most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats .	0	government
 6058 . Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes .	0	government
 An ex post facto law has a retroactive effect : it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed , or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact .	0	government
 6061 . Debate has always swirled over these issues .	0	government
 The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .	0	government
 Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .	0	government
 6064 . However , the Anti - Federalists argued that the Federalists’ position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere .	0	government
 The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .	0	government
 6067 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .	0	government
 In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .	1	government
 Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”	0	government
 6070 . In the short term , they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes .	0	government
 Their long - term solution was to propose two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites ; these rights became the Fourteenth Amendment , which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general , and the Fifteenth Amendment , which protected the right to vote in particular ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 But , the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to Native Americans .	0	government
 6073 . With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , civil liberties gained more clarification .	0	government
 First , the amendment says , “ no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States , ” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV , Section 2 , of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens .	0	government
 ( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .	0	government
 6076 . Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .	0	government
 For example , in Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) .	0	government
 6079 . When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well .	0	government
 It was only in the McDonald v. Chicago case two years later that the Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment into state law .	0	government
 Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .	0	government
 6082 . The First Amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the Bill of Rights ; it is arguably also the most extensive , because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public .	0	government
 Specifically , the First Amendment says :	0	government
 6085 . The key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing , in Thomas Jefferson ’s words , “ a wall of separation between church and state . ” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v. Kurtzman , the Supreme Court established the Lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand . Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) .	0	government
 The Lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect :	0	government
 6088 . The rights of conscientious objectors — individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought , conscience , or religion — have also been controversial , although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non - combatant medics during wartime .	0	government
 To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .	0	government
 6091 . In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .	0	government
 It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ” In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .	0	government
 This standard became known as the Sherbert test .	0	government
 Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government , the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs .	0	government
 6094 . Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .	0	government
 Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .	0	government
 6097 . Although the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights — free speech , press , assembly , and petition — we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression , particularly since the world ’s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication ( i.e. , speech and press ) in the centuries since the First Amendment was written and adopted .	0	government
 6100 . One such person was Gregory Lee Johnson , a member of various pro - communist and antiwar groups .	0	government
 In 1984 , as part of a protest near the Republican National Convention in Dallas , Texas , Johnson set fire to a U.S. flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole .	0	government
 6103 . Freedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well .	0	government
 In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	0	government
 This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers . New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) .	0	government
 These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military .	0	government

 Quarks are the second group of fundamental particles ( leptons are the first ) .	0	physics
 3262 . When a combination of quarks has color other than white , it exerts extremely large forces — even larger than the strong force — and perhaps can not be stable or permanently separated .	0	physics
 This is part of the theory of quark confinement , which explains how quarks can exist and yet never be isolated or directly observed .	1	physics
 Finally , an extra quantum number with three values ( like those we assign to color ) is necessary for quarks to obey the Pauli exclusion principle .	0	physics

 [ link ] is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } , similar to the diagrams in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces .	0	physics
 In the 1960s , a gauge theory , called electroweak theory , was developed by Steven Weinberg , Sheldon Glashow , and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies .	1	physics
 One of its predictions , in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena , was the existence of the W+,W−W+,W− , and Z0Z0 carrier particles .	0	physics
 3268 . In fact , there is enough energy when things are pushed to even smaller distances to transform the , and Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } into massless carrier particles more similar to photons and gluons .	0	physics
 These have not been observed experimentally , but there is a prediction of an associated particle called the Higgs boson .	0	physics
 The mass of this particle is not predicted with nearly the certainty with which the mass of the W+,W−,W+,W− , and Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } particles were predicted , but it was hoped that the Higgs boson could be observed at the now - canceled Superconducting Super Collider ( SSC ) .	0	physics

 Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity .	0	physics
 We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .	1	physics
 3277 . We know from Special Relativity that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event , particularly if they move relative to one another .	1	physics
 Einstein ’s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity .	1	physics
 General relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light .	1	physics
 3280 . Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape .	1	physics
 Bodies , like the Earth or the Sun , have what is called an escape velocity .	0	physics

 3286 . Introduced earlier in GUTS : The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and , thus , must contain quantum gravity .	1	physics
 The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles , including the graviton that carries the gravitational force , act like one - dimensional vibrating strings .	0	physics
 3289 . Finally , the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant , so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose . After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant , most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open .	0	physics
 Since matter can be thought to curve the space around it , we call an open universe negatively curved .	0	physics
 This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction .	1	physics
 3292 . The question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun are there .	0	physics
 If such bodies pass between us and a star , they will not block the star ’s light , being too small , but they will form a gravitational lens , as discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity . In a process called microlensing , light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner .	1	physics
 Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there .	0	physics
 3295 . The most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously unknown leptons ( sometimes obtusely referred to as non - baryonic matter ) .	0	physics
 These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation .	1	physics
 One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos .	1	physics

 Chaos is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions .	1	physics
 The orbit of the planet Pluto , for example , may be chaotic in that it can change tremendously due to small interactions with other planets .	0	physics
 3301 . For example , if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell , you will hear the bell ’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by .	0	physics
 The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift .	1	physics
 The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler ( 1803–1853 ) , who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers .	0	physics

 He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations , and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him . A synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated .	1	physics
 Particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed - radius orbits .	0	physics
 2639 . In order to describe the motion of an object , you must first be able to describe its position — where it is at any particular time .	1	physics
 More precisely , you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame .	0	physics
 2642 . Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them .	0	physics
 Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions .	1	physics
 Distance has no direction and , thus , no sign .	0	physics
 2645 . The motion of falling objects , as covered in Problem - Solving Basics for One - Dimensional Kinematics , is a simple one - dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement .	1	physics
 In this section , we consider two - dimensional projectile motion , such as that of a football or other object for which air resistance is negligible . The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can be analyzed separately .	0	physics
 This fact was discussed in Kinematics in Two Dimensions : An Introduction , where vertical and horizontal motions were seen to be independent .	0	physics
 2648 . When adding velocities , we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame .	1	physics
 These velocities are called relative velocities .	0	physics
 For example , the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground .	0	physics
 2651 . To understand this , we need a working definition of force .	0	physics
 Our intuitive definition of force — that is , a push or a pull — is a good place to start .	0	physics
 We know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction ( therefore , it is a vector quantity ) and can vary considerably in each regard .	0	physics
 2654 . Force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards , and it is a vector having both magnitude and direction .	1	physics
 2657 . Newton ’s second law of motion is closely related to Newton ’s first law of motion .	0	physics
 It mathematically states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion .	1	physics
 2660 . These will be discussed in more detail in later sections .	0	physics
 For now , we will define friction as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching .	1	physics
 [ link](b ) shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force ,	0	physics
 2663 . This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber , and the gas therefore exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket .	1	physics
 This reaction force is called thrust .	0	physics
 It is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them .	0	physics
 2669 . A diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free - body diagram .	1	physics
 Only forces are shown on free - body diagrams , not acceleration or velocity .	0	physics

 The components of the normal force N in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the weight of the car , respectively .	0	physics
 2684 . The SI unit for time , the second(abbreviated s ) , has a long history .	1	physics
 For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day .	0	physics
 2687 . SI units are part of the metric system .	0	physics
 The metric system is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by factors of 10 .	0	physics
 2690 . Scientists are continually trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it .	0	physics
 Physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy , matter , space , and time , and it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon .	1	physics
 The concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the realm of physics . Physics aims to describe the function of everything around us , from the movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people , cars , and spaceships .	0	physics
 2693 . The kinetic theory of gases , on the other hand , is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules .	1	physics
 Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses — thus , we picture them mentally to understand what our instruments tell us about the behavior of gases . A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments .	1	physics
 Often , a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation .	0	physics
 2696 . Modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories , relativity and quantum mechanics .	0	physics
 These theories deal with the very fast and the very small , respectively .	0	physics
 2702 . Average speed , however , is very different from average velocity .	0	physics
 Average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time .	1	physics
 2705 . Average Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes ,	1	physics
 2708 . The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth .	0	physics
 The acceleration of free - falling objects is therefore called the acceleration due to gravity .	1	physics
 The acceleration due to gravity is constant , which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible .	0	physics
 2711 . Science is based on observation and experiment — that is , on measurements .	0	physics
 Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement .	1	physics
 For example , let us say that you are measuring the length of standard computer paper .	0	physics
 2714 . How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division ?	0	physics
 If the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties ( a few percent or less ) , then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division .	0	physics
 This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation .	0	physics
 2717 . An understanding of acceleration , for example , is crucial to the study of force .	0	physics
 Our formal study of physics begins with kinematics which is defined as the study of motion without considering its causes .	1	physics
 The word “ kinematics ” comes from a Greek term meaning motion and is related to other English words such as “ cinema ” ( movies ) and “ kinesiology ” ( the study of human motion ) .	0	physics
 2720 . A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction .	1	physics
 Displacement , velocity , acceleration , and force , for example , are all vectors .	0	physics
 2723 . Note that in our example , we have only two vectors , so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail . Step 4 .	0	physics
 Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector .	0	physics
 This is the resultant , or the sum , of the other vectors .	0	physics
 The head of the vector D meets the head of the vertical vector .	0	physics
 2726 . This characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors .	0	physics
 Vector addition is commutative .	0	physics
 Vectors can be added in any order . A+B = B+A.A+B = B+A .	0	physics

 2729 . The head - to - tail method of adding vectors involves drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector .	1	physics
 The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector .	0	physics
 2732 . Experience suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left alone , and that an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving .	0	physics
 What Newton ’s first law of motion states , however , is the following :	0	physics
 2738 . The quantities that might differ between them are volume and density . Section SummaryNewton ’s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest , or , if in motion , remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force .	1	physics
 This is also known as the law of inertia .	0	physics
 2741 . As we will see , the basic forces are all thought to act through the exchange of microscopic carrier particles , and the characteristics of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles exchanged .	0	physics
 Action at a distance , such as the gravitational force of Earth on the Moon , is explained by the existence of a force field rather than by “ physical contact . ”	0	physics
 2744 . Friction is a force that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move ( which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice ) .	1	physics
 While a common force , the behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not completely understood .	0	physics
 2747 . We will therefore study not only motion along curves , but also the forces that cause it , including gravitational forces .	0	physics
 In some ways , this chapter is a continuation of Dynamics : Newton 's Laws of Motion as we study more applications of Newton ’s laws of motion . This chapter deals with the simplest form of curved motion , uniform circular motion , motion in a circular path at constant speed .	0	physics
 Studying this topic illustrates most concepts associated with rotational motion and leads to the study of many new topics we group under the name rotation .	0	physics
 2750 . You take the merry - go - round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together .	0	physics
 In that non - inertial frame , you feel a fictitious force , named centrifugal force ( not to be confused with centripetal force ) , trying to throw you off .	0	physics
 You must hang on tightly to counteract the centrifugal force .	0	physics
 2753 . The bodies we are dealing with tend to be large .	0	physics
 To simplify the situation we assume that the body acts as if its entire mass is concentrated at one specific point called the center of mass ( CM ) , which will be further explored in Linear Momentum and Collisions .	0	physics
" For two bodies having masses mm size 12{m } { } and MM size 12{M } { } with a distance rr size 12{r } { } between their centers of mass , the equation for Newton ’s universal law of gravitation isF = GmMr2,F = GmMr2 , size 12{F = G { { ital "" mM "" } over { r rSup { size 8{2 } } } } } { } where FF size 12{F } { } is the magnitude of the gravitational force and GG size 12{G } { } is a proportionality factor called the gravitational constant ."	0	physics
 2756 . Energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved .	0	physics
 We can loosely define energy as the ability to do work , admitting that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work .	1	physics
 Because of the association of energy with work , we begin the chapter with a discussion of work .	0	physics
 2759 . This expression is called the work - energy theorem , and it actually applies in general ( even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude ) , although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement .	0	physics
" The theorem implies that the net work on a system equals the change in the quantity 12mv212mv2 size 12 { { { 1 } over { 2 } } ital "" mv "" rSup { size 8{2 } } } { } ."	0	physics
 2762 . where i and f denote initial and final values .	0	physics
 This equation is a form of the work - energy theorem for conservative forces ; it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle .	0	physics
 Remember that this applies to the extent that all the forces are conservative , so that friction is negligible .	0	physics

 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 4682 . Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4685 . Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs .	0	economic
 Some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund , and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments .	0	economic
 Other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up .	0	economic
 4688 . Deposit insurance : Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $ 250,000 ( the amount was raised from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 ) if the bank should go bankrupt .	1	economic
 4691 . Some drivers are safer than others .	0	economic
 A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring .	1	economic
 4694 . For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 4697 . However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .	0	economic
 A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided .	1	economic
 In this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare provider , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later .	0	economic

 4706 . Venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size , but that have potential to grow substantially .	1	economic
 These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors , including banks , institutions like college endowments , insurance companies that hold financial reserves , and corporate pension funds .	0	economic
 4712 . A corporation is a business that “ incorporates”—that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits ( and losses ) .	1	economic
 Corporations may be private or public , and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded .	0	economic
 4715 . Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	1	economic
 Corporate giants like IBM , AT&T , Ford , General Electric , Microsoft , Merck , and Exxon all have millions of shares of stock .	0	economic

 The increase in the value of the stock ( or of any asset ) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain .	1	economic
 4721 . A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners .	0	economic
 Most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales , that do not have publicly issued stock , such as farm products dealer Cargill , the Mars candy company , and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm . When a firm decides to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company .	1	economic
 Shareholders own a public company .	0	economic
 4724 . The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased profitability .	1	economic
 It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .	0	economic
 4730 . Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .	0	economic
 With a CD , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically ranging from a few months to several years .	1	economic
 4733 . A bond is basically an “ I owe you ” note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital ( money ) .	0	economic
 The bond has a face value .	0	economic
 This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .	1	economic
 4736 . The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	1	economic
 This may or may not be the same as the face value .	0	economic

 4748 . A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference .	1	economic
 This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election . In a 1957 work , An Economic Theory of Democracy , the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way : “ It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se .	1	economic
 No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information , or how uncertain he is about which party to support , he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome … He will not even utilize all the free information available , since assimilating it takes time . ” In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two , the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters , who states : “ The chance that one man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election … is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ” The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process : spending .	0	economic

 4757 . In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .	0	economic
 However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .	0	economic
 HCAN , spending $ 60 million dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014 .	0	economic
 4760 . A nonprofit watchdog organization , called Citizens against Government Waste , produces an annual report , the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork - barrel spending , focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress , that were passed into law without any public hearings , or that serve only a local purpose .	1	economic
 Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , pork - barrel spending totaled $ 2.7 billion in 2014.Pork - barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor .	1	economic
 For example , if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district , the other members might oppose it .	0	economic
 4763 . This case goes against the theory of the “ median ” voter in a democracy .	0	economic
 The median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences .	1	economic
 If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum .	0	economic

 As the famous British economist Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago : “ [ E]conomic theory , in itself , preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws .	0	economic
 It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions . ” The study of economics is neither politically conservative , nor moderate , nor liberal .	0	economic
 4769 . How large is the U.S. economy ?	0	economic
 The size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year .	1	economic
 The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services — smart phones , cars , music downloads , computers , steel , bananas , college educations , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and summing them into a total dollar value .	0	economic
 4772 . If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .	0	economic
 Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about 15–18 % of GDP , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created .	0	economic
 However , it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption .	0	economic
 4775 . Since the early 1980s , imports have typically exceeded exports , and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years .	0	economic
 Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 4778 . They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year .	0	economic
 Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting , in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production .	1	economic
 For example , imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer , and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires .	0	economic
 4781 . One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product ( GNP ) .	0	economic
 GDP includes only what is produced within a country ’s borders .	0	economic
 4787 . GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy .	1	economic
 We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter .	0	economic
 4790 . The generally upward long - term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short - term declines .	0	economic
 A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 4793 . [ link ] lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900 .	0	economic
 The highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the trough .	1	economic
 Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 4796 . To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies , it is necessary to convert to a “ common denominator ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency .	1	economic
 Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	0	economic

 Richard Easterlin , an economist at the University of Southern California , wrote in 2000 :	0	economic
 4811 . A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .	1	economic
 In macroeconomics , the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function .	1	economic
 4814 . The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads ( also called infrastructure ) .	1	economic
 Again , greater physical capital implies more output .	0	economic
 4817 . To obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link](a ) by the population .	0	economic
 This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita ( that is , GDP divided by population ) .	1	economic
 The inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link](b ) .	0	economic
 4820 . The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research .	0	economic

 The economist Alexander Gerschenkron ( 1904–1978 ) gave this phenomenon a memorable name : “ the advantages of backwardness . ” Of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living .	0	economic
 He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up .	0	economic
 4826 . It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking , often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment .	0	economic
 Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force .	0	economic
 4829 . Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate .	0	economic
 This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job .	1	economic
 4832 . One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census .	0	economic
 But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly .	0	economic
 Instead , workers in these countries are engaged in short - term work , subsistence activities , and barter .	0	economic
 4835 . From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle .	0	economic
 In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity .	1	economic
 At the equilibrium wage ( We ) , the equilibrium quantity ( Qe ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers .	0	economic
 4838 . Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few .	0	economic
 A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone .	0	economic
 4841 . The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave .	1	economic
 The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay .	0	economic
 4844 . Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?	0	economic
 Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment .	1	economic
 4847 . Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment .	0	economic
 The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills .	1	economic
 4850 . Moreover , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too .	0	economic
 The second - to - last row of [ link ] shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six - fold from 1970 to 2014 .	0	economic

 Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods .	0	economic
 The general equation for percentage changes between two years , whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation , is :	0	economic
 4856 . The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .	0	economic
 The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	1	economic
 4859 . If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether .	0	economic
 Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living .	1	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature is a must - read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated .	0	economic
 4862 . It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	0	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 4865 . The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms : they are right after World War I and World War II .	0	economic
 However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s .	1	economic
 ( Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . )	0	economic
 4868 . Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists .	0	economic
 Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation .	0	economic
 One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ” Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree.”The Land of Funny Money	0	economic
 4871 . If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning .	0	economic
 4874 . One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension .	0	economic
 Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement .	1	economic
 For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans .	0	economic
 4877 . High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker .	1	economic
 Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages .	0	economic
 4880 . When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed .	1	economic
 An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 4883 . Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well .	0	economic
 An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 Often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM , compared to a fixed - rate loan .	0	economic
 4886 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 4889 . At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries .	0	economic
 The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year .	0	economic
 This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % .	0	economic
 4892 . Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers .	0	economic
 4895 . Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .	0	economic
 For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) .	1	economic
 The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market .	0	economic
 4898 . As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too .	0	economic
 The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital .	0	economic
 In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments .	0	economic
 4901 . Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country .	0	economic
 Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world .	0	economic
 The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account .	0	economic
 4904 . The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true .	0	economic
 Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital .	0	economic
 4907 . When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health .	0	economic
 But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher .	0	economic
 Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health .	0	economic
 4910 . How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?	0	economic
 Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic

 4233 . Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors , emotions , or drives ( Green , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions , speech , or movements , even when such expressions are normal or expected .	1	psychology
 This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in which a cause ( extreme trauma ) is explicitly specified . Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event , flashbacks ( states that can last from a few seconds to several days , during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment [ APA , 2013 ] ) , avoidance of stimuli connected to the event , persistently negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , guilt , and shame ) , feelings of detachment from others , irritability , proneness toward outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response ( jumpiness ) .	1	psychology

 4254 . People with persistent depressive disorder ( previously known as dysthymia ) experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years , as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder .	1	psychology
 4257 . During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .	1	psychology
 4260 . Another cognitive theory of depression , hopelessness theory , postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness , which then leads to depression ( Abramson , Metalsky , & Alloy , 1989 ) .	1	psychology
 According to this theory , hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes .	1	psychology
 People with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions , regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are .	1	psychology
 Some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , persistent , and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one ’s life , this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder . Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 As you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response ( UCR ) , eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 4278 . When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes .	1	psychology
 Neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder .	1	psychology
 Located in the brainstem , the locus coeruleus is the brain ’s major source of norepinephrine , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response .	1	psychology
 A diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder — what Sigmund Freud referred to as free - floating anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least six months , and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms : restlessness , difficulty concentrating , being easily fatigued , muscle tension , irritability , and sleep difficulties .	1	psychology
