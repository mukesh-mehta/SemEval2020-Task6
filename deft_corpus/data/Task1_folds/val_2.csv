 1881 . As previously discussed , antidiuretic hormone or ADH ( also called vasopressin ) , as the name suggests , helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume , especially that of blood , is low .	1	biology
 1884 . Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities .	1	biology
 Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies .	1	biology
 After a period of growth , an organism splits into two separate organisms .	1	biology
 1893 . Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized .	1	biology
 In oviparity , fertilized eggs are laid outside the female ’s body and develop there , receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg .	1	biology
 Some insects have a specialized sac , called a spermatheca , which stores sperm for later use , sometimes up to a year .	1	biology
 The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones .	1	biology
 The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1908 . The bulbourethral gland , or Cowper ’s gland , releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen .	1	biology
 The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora .	1	biology
 1914 . The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes .	1	biology
 1920 . Testosterone , the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence , stimulates spermatogenesis .	1	biology
 Progesterone assists in endometrial re - growth and inhibition of FSH and LH release .	1	biology
 If this mechanism fails , multiple sperm can fuse with the egg , resulting in polyspermy .	1	biology
 The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days .	0	biology
 1932 . In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .	0	biology
 Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .	1	biology
 The inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo .	1	biology
 1935 . The outer layers of the zygote ( blastocyst ) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells , and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue .	0	biology
 Another layer of the blastocyst , the chorion , begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin ( β - HCG ) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active .	1	biology
 This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo .	0	biology
 1938 . Infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth .	1	biology
 About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified ; these include diseases , such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women , or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals .	0	biology
 1941 . The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body .	0	biology
 A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them .	0	biology
 The somites , illustrated in [ link ] will further develop into the ribs , lungs , and segmental ( spine ) muscle .	0	biology
 1944 . Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource .	0	biology
 Ecologists also study interactions among various species ; members of different species are called heterospecifics .	1	biology
 Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation , parasitism , herbivory , competition , and pollination .	0	biology
 1947 . Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution .	1	biology
 Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation .	0	biology
 1950 . The nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year : in the spring and fall turnover .	0	biology
 The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline : a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers .	1	biology
 1953 . Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration .	1	biology
 In terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , excluding roots .	0	biology
 This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement .	0	biology
 1956 . The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .	1	biology
 The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 1959 . Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .	1	biology
 The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis .	0	biology
 1962 . The water here contains silt and is well - oxygenated , low in pressure , and stable in temperature .	0	biology
 Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .	1	biology
 Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1965 . Coral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean .	1	biology
 They are found within 30˚ north and south of the equator .	0	biology
 1968 . Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water , such as a river , meets the ocean .	1	biology
 Therefore , both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity ; mixing results in a diluted ( brackish ) saltwater .	0	biology
 1971 . Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream .	0	biology
 Streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water .	0	biology
 The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .	0	biology
 1974 . Scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the last sixty years .	0	biology
 Global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns , including a worldwide increase in temperature , due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide .	1	biology
 1980 . Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate .	0	biology
 When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth , gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere , as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping .	0	biology
 The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide , methane , water vapor , nitrous oxide , and ozone .	0	biology
 1983 . Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area , and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors : seasonal and yearly changes in the environment , natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions , and competition for resources between and within species .	0	biology
 The statistical study of population dynamics , demography , uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments .	1	biology
 Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations .	0	biology
 1989 . They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy .	0	biology
 Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday ( i.e. , their mortality rate ) , the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval , and their life expectancy at each interval .	1	biology
 An example of a life table is shown in [ link ] from a study of Dall mountain sheep , a species native to northwestern North America .	0	biology
 1992 . After the third hour , there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask , an increase of 4000 organisms .	0	biology
 The important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate — the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation — is accelerating ; that is , it is increasing at a greater and greater rate .	1	biology
 After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .	0	biology
 1995 . The value “ r ” can be positive , meaning the population is increasing in size ; or negative , meaning the population is decreasing in size ; or zero , where the population ’s size is unchanging , a condition known as zero population growth .	1	biology
 A further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase ( often thought of as the potential for reproduction ) , even under ideal conditions .	0	biology
 1998 . Eventually , the growth rate will plateau or level off ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This population size , which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support , is called the carrying capacity , or K.The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate .	1	biology
 The expression “ K – N ” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage , and “ K – N ” divided by “ K ” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth .	0	biology
 2001 . The age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics .	0	biology
 Age structure is the proportion of a population at different age ranges .	1	biology
 Age structure allows better prediction of population growth , plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region .	0	biology
 2007 . [ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .	0	biology
 In Emsleyan / Mertensian mimicry , a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one , such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non - venomous milk snake .	1	biology
 This type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types .	0	biology
 2010 . A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close , prolonged interaction , while the other neither benefits nor is harmed .	1	biology
 Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2013 . A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .	1	biology
 In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .	1	biology
 The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself .	0	biology
 2016 . Other factors influence species richness as well .	0	biology
 For example , the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains , including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin .	1	biology
 Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat , ecosystem , or biome .	1	biology
 2019 . Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time .	1	biology
 Sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes , earthquakes , storms , fires , and climate change .	0	biology
 Communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium .	0	biology
 2022 . Eventually , over 150 years , the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire .	1	biology
 This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community , which will remain stable until the next disturbance .	0	biology
 2025 . The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .	0	biology
 Animal behavior has been studied for decades , by biologists in the science of ethology , by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology , and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology .	0	biology
 Although there is overlap between these disciplines , scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches .	0	biology
 2028 . Another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis , or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 2031 . Migration is the long - range seasonal movement of animals .	1	biology
 It is an evolved , adapted response to variation in resource availability , and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals .	0	biology
 2034 . Courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors ( signals ) designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite sex to mate .	1	biology
 These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom .	0	biology
 2037 . Thus , it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility .	0	biology
 The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one ’s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection .	1	biology
 This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals .	0	biology
 2040 . Polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females .	1	biology
 In these situations , the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring .	0	biology
 2043 . ImprintingImprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved .	1	biology
 Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see , their mother , and make a bond with her .	0	biology
 2046 . In operant conditioning , the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the stimulus .	1	biology
 A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner , the inventor of the Skinner box .	0	biology
 2049 . Furthermore , some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring .	0	biology
 Thus , all species have an energy budget : they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism , reproduction , parental care , and energy storage ( such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation).Parental Care and Fecundity	0	biology
 2052 . Iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives .	1	biology
 Some animals are able to mate only once per year , but survive multiple mating seasons .	0	biology
 2055 . K - selected species are species selected by stable , predictable environments .	1	biology
 Populations of K - selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity ( hence the term K - selected ) where intraspecific competition is high .	0	biology
 2061 . The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .	1	biology
 The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .	1	biology
 Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact .	0	biology
 2064 . In many ecosystems , the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms ( plants and/or phytoplankton ) , which are called primary producers .	1	biology
 The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .	1	biology
 2067 . Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .	1	biology
 2070 . When you are ready to create a simulation , in the upper - right corner of the Interactive Labs box , click OPEN SIMULATOR.Two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem .	0	biology
 A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .	1	biology
 A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .	1	biology
 2073 . A holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition , interaction , and dynamics of entire ecosystems ; it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state .	1	biology
 A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model .	0	biology
 2076 . Analytical and simulation models , in contrast , are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation , although with some limitations as to accuracy .	0	biology
 An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .	1	biology
 2079 . Productivity within Trophic LevelsProductivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level .	1	biology
 Biomass is the total mass , in a unit area at the time of measurement , of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level .	1	biology
 Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level .	0	biology
 2082 . Another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency .	0	biology
 Net production efficiency ( NPE ) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass ; it is calculated using the following formula :	1	biology
 2085 . The structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids , which were first described by the pioneering studies of Charles Elton in the 1920s .	0	biology
 Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters ( such as number of organisms , energy , and biomass ) across trophic levels .	1	biology
 2088 . Water contains hydrogen and oxygen , which is essential to all living processes .	0	biology
 The hydrosphere is the area of the Earth where water movement and storage occurs : as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen ( rivers , lakes , oceans , groundwater , polar ice caps , and glaciers ) , and as water vapor in the atmosphere .	1	biology
 Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels .	0	biology
 2091 . Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .	0	biology
 Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction : the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another .	1	biology
 Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents .	0	biology
 2094 . Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , and as rain falls through the atmosphere , sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid ( H2SO4 ) .	0	biology
 Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout .	1	biology
 Also , the weathering of sulfur - containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil .	0	biology
 2097 . The biologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular habitat types and specific feeding strategies : eating plankton floating in the water , scraping and then eating algae from rocks , eating insect larvae from the bottom , and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid .	0	biology
 The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an adaptive radiation .	0	biology
 An adaptive radiation is a rapid ( less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria cichlids ) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species ; typically , the species “ radiate ” into different habitats and niches .	1	biology
 2100 . Many genes code for proteins , which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing .	0	biology
 Genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells , both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism .	1	biology
 This chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals , so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare .	0	biology
 2103 . It is not entirely clear how greater energy input could translate into more species .	0	biology
 The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity , or number of ecological niches , in the tropics relative to higher latitudes .	1	biology
 The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution , specialization , and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation .	0	biology
 2106 . Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation .	0	biology
 The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans , especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way .	0	biology
 2109 . Most fisheries are managed as a common ( shared ) resource even when the fishing territory lies within a country ’s territorial waters .	0	biology
 Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher .	1	biology
 The natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation .	0	biology
 5807 . The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system , but governments commonly provide such things as education , health care , and an infrastructure for transportation .	0	government
 The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals , especially those related to the division of resources within a nation .	1	government
 5810 . Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States , and many Americans tend to equate democracy , a political system in which people govern themselves , with capitalism .	1	government
 In theory , a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled , for good or bad , by government .	0	government
 5813 . Therefore , some goods are provided by the government .	0	government
 Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods .	1	government
 Two such public goods are national security and education .	0	government
 5816 . One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources .	0	government
 Unlike public goods , which all people may use without charge , common goods are in limited supply .	1	government
 5819 . A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people .	1	government
 In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .	1	government
 Instead , they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people .	0	government
 5822 . In a direct democracy , unlike representative democracy , people participate directly in making government decisions .	1	government
 For example , in ancient Athens , the most famous example of a direct democracy , all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly .	0	government
 5825 . Many Americans fear that a set of elite citizens is really in charge of government in the United States and that others have no influence .	1	government
 This belief is called the elite theory of government .	0	government
 In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government .	1	government
 5834 . Groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done .	0	government
 In 2014 , in the case of McCullen v. Coakley , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law that created a buffer zone between protestors and clinic entrances . McCullen v. Coakley , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) ; Melissa Jeltsen , “ The Reality of Abortion Clinics without Buffer Zones , ” The Huffington Post , 13 July 2014 .	1	government
 The federal government does not always side with those who oppose abortion , however .	0	government
 Several states have attempted to pass laws requiring women to notify their husbands , and often obtain their consent , before having an abortion .	0	government

 Although they may not realize it , becoming active in the community and engaging in a wide variety of community - based volunteer efforts are important forms of civic engagement and help government do its job .	0	government
 The demands on government are great , and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary .	0	government
 5858 . However , their hopes were not realized .	0	government
 Hoping to prevent conflict with Indian tribes in the Ohio Valley , Parliament passed the Proclamation of 1763 , which forbade the colonists to purchase land or settle west of the Appalachian Mountains . François Furstenberg .	1	government
 2008 . 5861 .	0	government
 The Sons of Liberty circulated this sensationalized version of the events of March 5 , 1770 , in order to promote the rightness of their cause ; it depicts British soldiers firing on unarmed civilians in the event that became known as the Boston Massacre .	1	government
 Later portrayals would more prominently feature Crispus Attucks , an African American who was one of the first to die .	0	government
 5864 . In the early months of 1774 , Parliament responded to this latest act of colonial defiance by passing a series of laws called the Coercive Acts , intended to punish Boston for leading resistance to British rule and to restore order in the colonies .	1	government
 These acts virtually abolished town meetings in Massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony ’s ability to govern itself .	0	government
 5867 . By this time , war with Great Britain had already begun , following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and British troops at Lexington and Concord , Massachusetts .	0	government
 Congress drafted a Declaration of Causes explaining the colonies’ reasons for rebellion .	0	government
 On July 2 , 1776 , Congress declared American independence from Britain and two days later signed the Declaration of Independence .	0	government
 5870 . The final draft of the Articles of Confederation , which formed the basis of the new nation ’s government , was accepted by Congress in November 1777 and submitted to the states for ratification .	1	government
 It would not become the law of the land until all thirteen states had approved it .	0	government
 5873 . Following the Declaration of Independence , each of the thirteen states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people , although the right to vote was limited to free ( white ) men , and the property requirements for voting differed among the states .	0	government
 Each state had a governor and an elected legislature .	0	government
 5876 . The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , already recognized by many , became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers , led by Daniel Shays .	1	government
 Known as Shays’ Rebellion , the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts , who called upon the national government for assistance .	0	government
 5879 . Because all thirteen states had to agree to any alteration of the Articles , the convention in Annapolis could not accomplish its goal .	0	government
 Two of the delegates , Alexander Hamilton and James Madison , requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .	0	government
 5882 . Those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of American society .	0	government
 The only decision that all could agree on was the election of George Washington , the former commander of the Continental Army and hero of the American Revolution , as the president of the convention .	0	government
 5885 . Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .	1	government
 Thus , smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states .	0	government
 5888 . The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .	0	government
 In Article I , ten sections describe the structure of Congress , the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress , the length of Congressional terms , and the powers of Congress .	0	government
 The national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation , slavery , and national power .	0	government
 5891 . Although debates over slavery and representation in Congress occupied many at the convention , the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful .	0	government
 The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .	0	government
 They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .	0	government
 5894 . The strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers’ creation of a federal system of government .	0	government
 In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .	1	government
 Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .	1	government
 5897 . Although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty , the supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution proclaimed that the Constitution , laws passed by Congress , and treaties made by the federal government were “ the supreme Law of the Land . ” In the event of a conflict between the states and the national government , the national government would triumph .	0	government
 Furthermore , although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution , Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed .	0	government
 5900 . But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states .	0	government
 Virginia ’s Patrick Henry , for example , feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man .	0	government
 He also disapproved of the federal government ’s new ability to tax its citizens .	0	government
 5903 . On the question of ratification , citizens quickly separated into two groups : Federalists and Anti - Federalists .	0	government
 The Federalists supported it .	0	government
 They tended to be among the elite members of society — wealthy and well - educated landowners , businessmen , and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth .	1	government
 5906 . The Constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education , and Article VI explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office .	0	government
 This caused many , like Henry Abbot of North Carolina , to fear that government would be placed in the hands of “ pagans .	0	government
 .	0	government
 5909 . Furthermore , tyranny could not arise in a government in which “ the legislature necessarily predominates . ” Finally , the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them , described as “ personal motives , ” would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority .	1	government
 According to Madison , “ Ambition must be made to counteract ambition . ”	0	government

 5918 . Of these , only ten were accepted by three - quarters of the state legislatures .	0	government
 In 1791 , these first ten amendments were added to the Constitution and became known as the Bill of Rights .	1	government
 5924 . The prohibition in the First Amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both English precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches .	0	government
 The Fourth Amendment , which protects Americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property , was also new .	1	government
 5927 . Other amendments rectify problems that have arisen over the years or that reflect changing times .	0	government
 For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .	1	government
 The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .	1	government
 5930 . The Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments , ratified at the end of the Civil War , changed the lives of African Americans who had been held in slavery .	0	government
 The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .	1	government
 The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .	1	government
 5933 . The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .	1	government
 After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .	1	government
 5936 . The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War .	0	government
 The Twenty - Sixth Amendment reduced the voting age from twenty - one to eighteen .	1	government
 Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them .	0	government
 5939 . Federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government , each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution . See John Kincaid .	1	government
 1975 . 5942 .	0	government
 Division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In contrast to federalism , a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government , where significant authority is concentrated .	1	government
 Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .	0	government
 5945 . The Constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of U.S. federalism .	0	government
 Some delineate the scope of national and state power , while others restrict it .	0	government
 5948 . What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .	0	government
 The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .	1	government
 5951 . Like the federal government , the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus , passing bills of attainder , or enacting ex post facto laws .	0	government
 Furthermore , the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution , due process of law , or the equal protection of the laws .	1	government
 Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .	0	government
 5954 . The movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades .	0	government
 In light of Baehr v. Lewin , a 1993 ruling in which the Hawaii Supreme Court asserted that the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates . Baehr v. Lewin .	1	government
 1993 . 5960 .	0	government
 Although the data reflect 2013 results , the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years .	0	government
 For the federal government , 47 percent of 2013 revenue came from individual income taxes and 34 percent from payroll taxes , which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax .	0	government
 5966 . When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .	0	government
 However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .	0	government
 5969 . The Supreme Court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property .	0	government
 Under the supremacy clause of Article VI , legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws .	1	government
 As the court observed , “ the government of the Union , though limited in its powers , is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws , when made in pursuance of the constitution , form the supreme law of the land . ” Maryland ’s action violated national supremacy because “ the power to tax is the power to destroy . ” This second ruling established the principle of national supremacy , which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government .	1	government
 5972 . First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .	1	government
 Second , because the federal Licensing Act of 1793 , which regulated coastal commerce , was a constitutional exercise of Congress ’s authority under the commerce clause , federal law trumped the New York State license - monopoly law that had granted Ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license .	1	government
 As Marshall pointed out , “ the acts of New York must yield to the law of Congress.”Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .	0	government
 5975 . A nullification crisis emerged in the 1830s over President Andrew Jackson ’s tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 .	0	government
 Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .	0	government
 South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .	0	government
 5981 . Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .	1	government
 But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .	0	government
 What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .	1	government
 The defeat of the South had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways .	0	government
 5984 . The late 1870s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of U.S. federalism .	0	government
 Under dual federalism , the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction .	1	government
 Like the layers of a cake , the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined .	0	government
 5990 . The Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Between 1929 and 1933 , the national unemployment rate reached 25 percent , industrial output dropped by half , stock market assets lost more than half their value , thousands of banks went out of business , and the gross domestic product shrunk by one - quarter . Nicholas Crafts and Peter Fearon .	0	government
 5993 . The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .	0	government
 The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .	0	government
 The court ’s obstructionist position infuriated Roosevelt , leading him in 1937 to propose a court - packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy , thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments .	0	government
 5996 . The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .	0	government
 Before the Great Depression , the government offered little in terms of financial aid , social benefits , and economic rights .	0	government
 After the New Deal , it provided old - age pensions ( Social Security ) , unemployment insurance , agricultural subsidies , protections for organizing in the workplace , and a variety of other public services created during Roosevelt ’s administration .	1	government
 6002 . Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras , most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded .	0	government
 The Social Security Act of 1935 , which created federal subsidies for state - administered programs for the elderly ; people with handicaps ; dependent mothers ; and children , gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels .	1	government
 The unemployment insurance program , also created by the Social Security Act , requires states to provide jobless benefits , but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits .	1	government
 6005 . New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .	1	government
 During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .	0	government
 The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution .	0	government
 6008 . However , many would say that the years since the 9/11 attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power .	0	government
 The creation of the Department of Homeland Security federalized disaster response power in Washington , and the Transportation Security Administration was created to federalize airport security .	1	government
 Broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the Faith - Based Initiative and No Child Left Behind ( during the George W. Bush administration ) and the Affordable Care Act ( during Barack Obama ’s administration ) .	0	government
 6011 . The national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the Articles of Confederation when it provided states with land grants .	0	government
 In the first half of the 1800s , land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states .	0	government
 6014 . Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .	1	government
 Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .	1	government
 Finally , recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants .	0	government
 6017 . However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .	0	government
 The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .	0	government
 Under the AFDC , the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount .	0	government
 6020 . For example , Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination .	1	government
 Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .	1	government
 6023 . A new piece of legislation aims to take this approach further .	0	government
 The 2015 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act , HR 50 , passed the House early in 2015 before being referred to the Senate , where it waits committee consideration . U.S .	0	government
 Congress .	0	government
 6026 . The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .	1	government
 The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .	1	government
 6029 . “ Discrediting ‘ Self Deportation’ as Immigration Policy , ” February 6 . http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/discrediting-%E2%80%9Cself-deportation%E2%80%9D-immigration-policy The federal government filed suit to block the Arizona law , contending that it conflicted with federal immigration laws .	0	government
 Arizona ’s law has also divided society , because some groups , like the Tea Party movement , have supported its tough stance against illegal immigrants , while other groups have opposed it for humanitarian and human - rights reasons ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 According to a poll of Latino voters in the state by Arizona State University researchers , 81 percent opposed this bill . Daniel González .	0	government
 6032 . The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .	0	government
 However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling . Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .	0	government
 All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .	0	government
 That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .	0	government
 6035 . Edith Windsor , the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor , has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same - sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections .	1	government
 In 2007 , after having lived together since the late 1960s , Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada , where same - sex marriage was legal .	0	government

 In the final analysis , same - sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court , which took up the issue again when it heard Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 .	1	government
 6041 . Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) was established in 1980 by a woman whose thirteen - year - old daughter had been killed by a drunk driver .	0	government
 The organization lobbied state legislators to raise the drinking age and impose tougher penalties , but without success .	1	government
 6044 . The strategy anti - abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping .	0	government
 In their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision making abortion legal nationwide , anti - abortion advocates initially targeted Congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation . Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .	1	government
 Lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators , where their advocacy efforts have been more successful .	0	government
 By 2015 , for example , thirty - eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor ’s decision to have an abortion , forty - six states allowed individual health - care providers to refuse to participate in abortions , and thirty - two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the woman ’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .	0	government
 6047 . Federalism also comes with drawbacks .	0	government
 Chief among them are economic disparities across states , race - to - the - bottom dynamics ( i.e. , states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations ) , and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance .	1	government
 6050 . Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the deaths of African Americans during interactions with police .	0	government
 Many people were deeply troubled by the revelations of Edward Snowden ( [ link ] ) that U.S. government agencies are conducting widespread surveillance , capturing not only the conversations of foreign leaders and suspected terrorists but also the private communications of U.S. citizens , even those not suspected of criminal activity .	0	government
 6053 . The idea that Americans — indeed , people in general — have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence .	0	government
 In writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Thomas Jefferson drew on the ideas of John Locke to express the colonists’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects .	0	government
 It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists’ liberties .	0	government
 6056 . Indeed , the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens , based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors .	0	government
 In Article I , Section 9 , the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways : prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder , prohibiting ex post facto laws , and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus .	0	government
 6059 . Finally , the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common - law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained .	1	government
 Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .	0	government
 6062 . The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .	0	government
 Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .	0	government
 84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .	0	government
 6065 . The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .	0	government
 One of the Anti - Federalists , Brutus , whom most scholars believe to be Robert Yates , wrote : “ The powers , rights , and authority , granted to the general government by this Constitution , are as complete , with respect to every object to which they extend , as that of any state government — It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness — Life , liberty , and property , are under its controul [ sic ] .	0	government
 There is the same reason , therefore , that the exercise of power , in this case , should be restrained within proper limits , as in that of the state governments.”Constitution Society , “ To the Citizens of the State of New - York , ” http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus02.htm ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process .	0	government
 6068 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .	0	government
 In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .	1	government
 Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”	0	government
 6071 . Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 .	0	government
 Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters .	0	government
 6074 . ( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .	0	government
 Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .	0	government
 In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another . Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .	1	government
 More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .	1	government
 6077 . Beginning in 1897 , the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states , even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does — or at all .	0	government
 This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly .	0	government
 When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures , the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional .	0	government
 6080 . Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .	0	government
 In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	1	government
 6083 . The first of these two freedoms is known as the establishment clause .	0	government
 Congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state - sponsored religion ( this now includes the states too ) .	1	government
 6086 . But some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed .	0	government
 For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens .	1	government
 They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons .	0	government
 6089 . To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .	0	government
 However , the Supreme Court ruled in Gillette v. United States that to claim to be a conscientious objector , a person must be opposed to serving in any war , not just some wars . Gillette v. United States , 401 U.S. 437 ( 1971 ) .	1	government
 6092 . In 1990 , the Supreme Court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the Sherbert test in Employment Division v. Smith , more popularly known as “ the peyote case.”Employment Division , Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872 ( 1990 ) .	0	government
 This case involved two men who were members of the Native American Church , a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments .	1	government
 After being arrested for possession of peyote , the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic .	0	government
 6095 . Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .	0	government
 Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .	1	government
 Based in part on the federal RFRA , the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby ’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business’ owners , because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby ’s employees ( e.g. , paying for them directly ) .	0	government
 6098 . Americans who vocally supported the communist cause or opposed the war often found themselves in jail .	0	government
 In Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled that people encouraging young men to dodge the draft could be imprisoned for doing so , arguing that recommending that people disobey the law was tantamount to “ falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic ” and thus presented a “ clear and present danger ” to public order . Schenck v. United States , 249 U.S. 47 ( 1919 ) .	1	government
 Similarly , communists and other revolutionary anarchists and socialists during the Red Scare after the war were prosecuted under various state and federal laws for supporting the forceful or violent overthrow of government .	0	government
 This general approach to political speech remained in place for the next fifty years .	0	government
 6101 . He was arrested , charged with “ desecration of a venerated object ” ( among other offenses ) , and eventually convicted of that offense .	0	government
 However , in 1989 , the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson that burning the flag was a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment and found the law , as applied to flag desecration , to be unconstitutional . Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397 ( 1989 ) .	1	government
 6104 . In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .	1	government
 This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers . New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) .	0	government
 These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military .	0	government
 More specifically , the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 .	1	government
 Daniel Ellsberg famously released passages of the Papers to the press to show that the United States had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing Cambodia and Laos among other deeds while lying to the American public about doing so .	0	government
 2420 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform .	0	history
 Some authors , such as Jack London , who wrote The Call of the Wild , embraced a school of thought called naturalism , which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity ( [ link]).Jack London poses with his dog Rollo in 1885 ( a ) .	1	history

 2423 . The campaign was a typical one for the era : Democrats shone a spotlight on earlier Republican scandals , such as the Crédit Mobilier affair , and Republicans relied upon the bloody shirt campaign , reminding the nation of the terrible human toll of the war against southern confederates who now reappeared in national politics under the mantle of the Democratic Party .	1	history
 President Grant previously had great success with the “ bloody shirt ” strategy in the 1868 election , when Republican supporters attacked Democratic candidate Horatio Seymour for his sympathy with New York City draft rioters during the war .	0	history
 2426 . With his efforts towards ensuring African American civil rights stymied by a Democratic Congress , and his decision to halt the coinage of silver merely adding to the pressures of the economic Panic of 1873 , Hayes failed to achieve any significant legislation during his presidency .	0	history
 However , he did make a few overtures towards civil service reform .	0	history
 2429 . At the state level , specifically in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Illinois , and Iowa , the Patrons of Husbandry did briefly succeed in urging the passage of Granger Laws , which regulated some railroad rates along with the prices charged by grain elevator operators .	1	history
 The movement also created a political party — the Greenback Party , so named for its support of print currency ( or “ greenbacks ” ) not based upon a gold standard — which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen . However , such successes were short - lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers .	1	history

 He had previously served as the governor of the Philippines following the Spanish - American War , had a distinguished judicial career , and served as Roosevelt ’s Secretary of War from 1904 to 1908 .	0	history
 Republican leaders , however , were anxious to reestablish tighter control over the party after Roosevelt ’s departure , and they left Taft little room to maneuver .	0	history
 2453 . Wilson described his more moderate approach as one of New Freedom , which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks .	0	history
 Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of New Nationalism , a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests .	1	history
 He sought to capitalize on the stewardship approach that he had made famous during his previous administration .	0	history

 2462 . In 1899 , Secretary of State Hay made a bold move to acquire China ’s vast markets for American access by introducing Open Door notes , a series of circular notes that Hay himself drafted as an expression of U.S. interests in the region and sent to the other competing powers ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 These notes , if agreed to by the other five nations maintaining spheres of influences in China , would erase all spheres and essentially open all doors to free trade , with no special tariffs or transportation controls that would give unfair advantages to one country over another .	0	history
 2465 . When William Howard Taft became president in 1909 , he chose to adapt Roosevelt ’s foreign policy philosophy to one that reflected American economic power at the time .	0	history
 In what became known as “ dollar diplomacy , ” Taft announced his decision to “ substitute dollars for bullets ” in an effort to use foreign policy to secure markets and opportunities for American businessmen ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Not unlike Roosevelt ’s threat of force , Taft used the threat of American economic clout to coerce countries into agreements to benefit the United States .	0	history

 2471 . The court ruled that during a time of war , the federal government was justified in passing such laws to quiet dissenters .	0	history
 The decision was unanimous , and in the court ’s opinion , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that such dissent presented a “ clear and present danger ” to the safety of the United States and the military , and was therefore justified .	0	history
 He further explained how the First Amendment right of free speech did not protect such dissent , in the same manner that a citizen could not be freely permitted to yell “ fire ! ” in a crowded theater , due to the danger it presented .	0	history
 2474 . Prohibition , as the anti - alcohol movement became known , had been a goal of many Progressives for decades .	1	history
 Organizations such as the Women ’s Christian Temperance Union and the Anti - Saloon League linked alcohol consumption with any number of societal problems , and they had worked tirelessly with municipalities and counties to limit or prohibit alcohol on a local scale .	0	history
 2477 . But on the other side of the political spectrum , interventionists argued that Article X would impede the United States from using her rightfully attained military power to secure and protect America ’s international interests . Wilson ’s greatest fight was with the Senate , where most Republicans opposed the treaty due to the clauses surrounding the creation of the League of Nations .	0	history
 Some Republicans , known as Irreconcilables , opposed the treaty on all grounds , whereas others , called Reservationists , would support the treaty if sufficient amendments were introduced that could eliminate Article X .	1	history
 In an effort to turn public support into a weapon against those in opposition , Wilson embarked on a cross - country railway speaking tour .	0	history
 2480 . But in the 1910s , as major filmmakers like D. W. Griffith looked to escape the cost of Edison ’s patents on camera equipment , this began to change .	0	history
 When Griffith filmed In Old California ( 1910 ) , the first movie ever shot in Hollywood , California , the small town north of Los Angeles was little more than a village .	1	history
 As moviemakers flocked to southern California , not least because of its favorable climate and predictable sunshine , Hollywood swelled with moviemaking activity .	0	history
 2483 . Ford even bought a plot of land in the Amazonian jungle twice the size of Delaware to build a factory town he called Fordlandia .	0	history
 Workers there rejected his midwestern Puritanism even more than his factory discipline , and the project ended in an epic failure .	0	history
 2486 . Town leaders in Dayton , Tennessee , for their part , sensed an opportunity to promote their town , which had lost more than one - third of its population , and welcomed the ACLU to stage a test case against the Butler Act .	0	history
 The ACLU and the town got their wish as the Scopes Monkey Trial , as the newspapers publicized it , quickly turned into a carnival that captured the attention of the country and epitomized the nation ’s urban / rural divide ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2489 . The new Negro found political expression in a political ideology that celebrated African Americans distinct national identity .	0	history
 This Negro nationalism , as some referred to it , proposed that African Americans had a distinct and separate national heritage that should inspire pride and a sense of community .	1	history

 2516 . Within forty - eight hours of his inauguration , Roosevelt proclaimed an official bank holiday and called Congress into a special session to address the crisis .	0	history
 The resulting Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was signed into law on March 9 , 1933 , a scant eight hours after Congress first saw it .	0	history
 The law officially took the country off the gold standard , a restrictive practice that , although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe , severely limited the circulation of paper money .	1	history
 2525 . The biggest threat to the president , however , came from corrupt but beloved Louisiana senator Huey “ Kingfish ” Long ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 His disapproval of Roosevelt came in part from his own ambitions for higher office ; Long stated that the president was not doing enough to help people and proposed his own Share Our Wealth program .	0	history
 2528 . With the implementation of the Second New Deal , Roosevelt also created the country ’s present - day social safety net .	0	history
 The Social Security Act established programs intended to help the most vulnerable : the elderly , the unemployed , the disabled , and the young .	1	history
 It included a pension fund for all retired people — except domestic workers and farmers , which therefore left many women and African Americans beyond the scope of its benefits — over the age of sixty - five , to be paid through a payroll tax on both employee and employer .	0	history
 2531 . Within his White House , Roosevelt had a number of African American appointees , although most were in minor positions .	0	history
 Unofficially , Roosevelt relied upon advice from the Federal Council on Negro Affairs , also known as his “ Black Cabinet . ” This group included a young Harvard economist , Dr. Robert Weaver , who subsequently became the nation ’s first black cabinet secretary in 1966 , as President Lyndon Johnson ’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development .	0	history
 Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .	0	history
 2534 . In 1919 , Mussolini created the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento ( Italian Combat Squadron ) .	1	history
 The organization ’s main tenets of Fascism called for a totalitarian form of government and a heightened focus on national unity , militarism , social Darwinism , and loyalty to the state .	1	history
 With the support of major Italian industrialists and the king , who saw Fascism as a bulwark against growing Socialist and Communist movements , Mussolini became prime minister in 1922 .	0	history
 2537 . By the end of the war , however , manpower needs resulted in African American recruits serving in the infantry and flying planes .	0	history
 The Tuskegee Institute in Alabama had instituted a civilian pilot training program for aspiring African American pilots .	0	history
 When the war began , the Department of War absorbed the program and adapted it to train combat pilots .	0	history
 2540 . Still , there was some resistance to women going to work in such a male - dominated environment .	0	history
 In order to recruit women for factory jobs , the government created a propaganda campaign centered on a now - iconic figure known as Rosie the Riveter ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Rosie , who was a composite based on several real women , was most famously depicted by American illustrator Norman Rockwell .	0	history
 2543 . Japanese Americans also suffered from discrimination .	0	history

 A huge mushroom cloud rose above the city .	0	history
 2552 . Kennedy ’s various aid projects , like the Peace Corps , fit closely with his administration ’s flexible response , which Robert McNamara advocated as a better alternative to the all - or - nothing defensive strategy of mutually assured destruction favored during Eisenhower ’s presidency .	0	history
 The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .	0	history
 2555 . Organized in 1960 , SDS held its first meeting at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .	0	history
 Its philosophy was expressed in its manifesto , the Port Huron Statement , written by Tom Hayden and adopted in 1962 , affirming the group ’s dedication to fighting economic inequality and discrimination .	0	history
 It called for greater participation in the democratic process by ordinary people , advocated civil disobedience , and rejected the anti - Communist position held by most other groups committed to social reform in the United States .	1	history
 2558 . This act provided increased federal funding to both elementary and secondary schools , allocating more than $ 1 billion for the purchase of books and library materials , and the creation of educational programs for disadvantaged children .	0	history
 The Higher Education Act , signed into law the same year , provided scholarships and low - interest loans for the poor , increased federal funding for colleges and universities , and created a corps of teachers to serve schools in impoverished areas .	1	history
 2561 . Within the chorus of voices calling for integration and legal equality were many that more stridently demanded empowerment and thus supported Black Power .	0	history
 Black Power meant a variety of things .	0	history
 2564 . Well before the end of the war , Congress had passed one of the most significant and far - reaching pieces of legislation to ease veterans’ transition into civilian life : the Servicemen ’s Readjustment Act , also known as the GI Bill ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Every honorably discharged veteran who had seen active duty , but not necessarily combat , was eligible to receive a year ’s worth of unemployment compensation .	1	history
 2573 . As a result of these conditions , Communism was making significant inroads in both Italy and France .	0	history
 These concerns led Truman , along with Secretary of State George C. Marshall , to propose to Congress the European Recovery Program , popularly known as the Marshall Plan .	0	history
 Between its implantation in April 1948 and its termination in 1951 , this program gave $ 13 billion in economic aid to European nations .	0	history
 2579 . One of the first developers to take advantage of this method was William Levitt , who purchased farmland in Nassau County , Long Island , in 1947 and built thousands of prefabricated houses .	0	history
 The new community was named Levittown .	0	history
 2582 . In the late 1940s , some white country musicians began to experiment with the rhythms of the blues , a decades - old musical genre of rural southern blacks .	1	history
 This experimentation led to the creation of a new musical form known as rockabilly , and by the 1950s , rockabilly had developed into rock and roll .	0	history
 Rock and roll music celebrated themes such as young love and freedom from the oppression of middle - class society .	1	history
 2588 . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , many young people came to embrace a new wave of cultural dissent .	1	history
 The counterculture offered an alternative to the bland homogeneity of American middle - class life , patriarchal family structures , self - discipline , unquestioning patriotism , and the acquisition of property .	0	history
 In fact , there were many alternative cultures .	0	history
 2591 . Although Goldwater lost the 1964 election , his vigorous rejection of New Deal state and social legislation , along with his support of states’ rights , proved popular in the Deep South , which had resisted federal efforts at racial integration .	0	history
 Taking a lesson from Goldwater ’s experience , Nixon also employed a southern strategy in 1968 .	0	history
 Denouncing segregation and the denial of the vote to African Americans , he nevertheless maintained that southern states be allowed to pursue racial equality at their own pace and criticized forced integration .	0	history
 2597 . Continuing his strategy of pitting one Communist nation against another , in May 1972 , Nixon made another newsworthy trip , traveling to Moscow to meet with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev .	0	history
 The two discussed a policy of détente , a relaxation of tensions between their nations , and signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty ( SALT ) , which limited each side to deploying only two antiballistic missile systems .	1	history
 It also limited the number of nuclear missiles maintained by each country .	0	history
 2600 . But Nixon ’s victory was short - lived , however , for it was soon discovered that he and members of his administration had routinely engaged in unethical and illegal behavior during his first term .	0	history
 Following the publication of the Pentagon Papers , for instance , the “ plumbers , ” a group of men used by the White House to spy on the president ’s opponents and stop leaks to the press , broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg ’s psychiatrist to steal Ellsberg ’s file and learn information that might damage his reputation .	1	history

 2606 . While many suffered , others prospered .	0	history
 The 1970s had been the era of the hippie , and Newsweek magazine declared 1984 to be the “ year of the Yuppie . ” Yuppies , whose name derived from “ ( y)oung , ( u)rban ( p)rofessionals , ” were akin to hippies in being young people whose interests , values , and lifestyle influenced American culture , economy , and politics , just as the hippies’ credo had done in the late 1960s and 1970s .	1	history
 Unlike hippies , however , yuppies were materialistic and obsessed with image , comfort , and economic prosperity .	0	history
 2609 . Concern over a decline in the country ’s moral values welled up on both sides of the political aisle .	0	history
 In 1985 , anxiety over the messages of the music industry led to the founding of the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) , a bipartisan group formed by the wives of prominent Washington politicians including Susan Baker , the wife of Reagan ’s treasury secretary , James Baker , and Tipper Gore , the wife of then - senator Al Gore , who later became vice president under Bill Clinton .	1	history

 He entered the White House a “ cold warrior ” and referred to the Soviet Union in a 1983 speech as an “ evil empire . ” Dedicated to upholding even authoritarian governments in foreign countries to keep them safe from Soviet influence , he was also desperate to put to rest Vietnam Syndrome , the reluctance to use military force in foreign countries for fear of embarrassing defeat , which had influenced U.S. foreign policy since the mid-1970s .	1	history
 2615 . Wary of not having sufficient domestic support for combat , Bush first deployed troops to the area to build up forces in the region and defend Saudi Arabia via Operation Desert Shield ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 On January 14 , Bush succeeded in getting resolutions from Congress authorizing the use of military force against Iraq , and the U.S. then orchestrated an effective air campaign , followed by Operation Desert Storm , a one - hundred - hour land war involving over 500,000 U.S. troops and another 200,000 from twenty - seven other countries , which expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait by the end of February .	1	history
 2618 . With 49 percent of the popular vote and 379 electoral votes , he became the first Democrat to win reelection to the presidency since Franklin Roosevelt .	0	history
 Clinton ’s victory was partly due to a significant gender gap between the parties , with women tending to favor Democratic candidates .	0	history

 This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .	1	history
 2624 . The more militant side won , and the argument for war was gradually laid out for the American people .	0	history
 The immediate impetus to the invasion , it argued , was the fear that Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) : nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons capable of wreaking great havoc .	1	history
 Hussein had in fact used WMDs against Iranian forces during his war with Iran in the 1980s , and against the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988—a time when the United States actively supported the Iraqi dictator .	0	history
 2627 . The second proposed solution was to give students the opportunity to attend schools with better performance records .	0	history
 Some of these might be charter schools , institutions funded by local tax monies in much the same way as public schools , but able to accept private donations and exempt from some of the rules public schools must follow .	1	history
 During the administration of George H. W. Bush , the development of charter schools had gathered momentum , and the American Federation of Teachers welcomed them as places to employ innovative teaching methods or offer specialized instruction in particular subjects .	0	history
 2630 . Once they had purchased the loans , larger investment banks bundled them into huge packages known as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and sold them to investors around the world .	0	history
 Even though CDOs consisted of subprime mortgages , credit card debt , and other risky investments , credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe .	1	history
 2633 . In the 1990s , the idea of legal , same - sex marriage seemed particularly unlikely ; neither of the two main political parties expressed support for it .	0	history
 Things began to change , however , following Vermont ’s decision to allow same - sex couples to form state - recognized civil unions in which they could enjoy all the legal rights and privileges of marriage .	0	history
 Although it was the intention of the state to create a type of legal relationship equivalent to marriage , it did not use the word “ marriage ” to describe it .	0	history
 606 . The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method ( also known as the dideoxy method ) , which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s .	0	biology
 The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single - stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide ( dNTP ) , which is a monomer , or a single unit , of DNA . The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTPs ) .	0	biology
 609 . By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment , the entire DNA sequence can be reformed .	0	biology
 A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig .	1	biology
 As an analogy , consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear .	0	biology
 612 . A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms .	0	biology
 A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism .	1	biology
 Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .	0	biology
 615 . A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type .	1	biology
 Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs , and the mRNAs encode proteins .	0	biology
 618 . Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .	1	biology
 The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .	1	biology
 Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics , as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors .	0	biology
 621 . The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false - negative results .	0	biology
 A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive .	1	biology
 In other words , many cases of cancer go undetected , which makes biomarkers unreliable .	0	biology
 624 . Traditionally , microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions , which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory .	1	biology
 Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours , their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly .	0	biology
 627 . Natural selection can only take place if there is variation , or differences , among individuals in a population .	0	biology
 Importantly , these differences must have some genetic basis ; otherwise , the selection will not lead to change in the next generation .	0	biology
 630 . However , the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures .	0	biology
 This phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry .	1	biology
 The two species came to the same function , flying , but did so separately from each other . These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs .	0	biology
 633 . Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with .	0	biology
 An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce , forming hybrids , is called a hybrid zone .	1	biology
 Over time , the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 636 . In the gradual speciation model , species diverge gradually over time in small steps .	1	biology
 In the punctuated equilibrium model , a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium , because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward .	0	biology
 639 . Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation : the formation of two species from one original species .	1	biology
 Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in On the Origin of Species ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 642 . Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories : dispersal and vicariance .	0	biology
 Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area , and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms .	1	biology
 645 . The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid .	1	biology
 The prefix “ allo- ” means “ other ” ( recall from allopatric ) : therefore , an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine .	0	biology
 648 . Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .	1	biology
 A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .	1	biology
 651 . Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place .	1	biology
 For example , male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females .	0	biology
 654 . Initially , the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur .	0	biology
 But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis — the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today .	1	biology
 In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .	0	biology
 657 . The allele frequency ( or gene frequency ) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population .	1	biology
 Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms , but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change .	0	biology
 660 . If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population , p + q = 1 .	0	biology
 In other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population . But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles , but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes , known as the population ’s genetic structure , from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes .	0	biology
 If the phenotype is observed , only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known ; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes .	0	biology
 663 . The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance .	1	biology
 When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .	0	biology
 666 . Over time , the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population , and the population will , as a result , grow larger on average .	0	biology
 That is , this would occur if this particular selection pressure , or driving selective force , were the only one acting on the population .	0	biology
 In other examples , better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure .	0	biology
 669 . Another important evolutionary force is gene flow : the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 While some populations are fairly stable , others experience more flux .	0	biology
 672 . Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations .	0	biology
 Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .	0	biology
 One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .	1	biology
 675 . An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( fecundity ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease , that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age .	1	biology
 Natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( Darwinian ) fitness .	1	biology
 678 . When the environment changes , populations will often undergo directional selection ( [ link ] ) , which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation .	1	biology
 A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth - century England .	0	biology
 681 . Males are often larger , for example , and display many elaborate colors and adornments , like the peacock ’s tail , while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration .	1	biology
 Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms ( [ link ] ) , which arise from the fact that in many populations , particularly animal populations , there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females .	0	biology
 That is , some males — often the bigger , stronger , or more decorated males — get the vast majority of the total matings , while others receive none .	0	biology
 684 . In 1915 , biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection : the Fisherian runaway model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference . In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring .	1	biology
 687 . Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor .	0	biology
 Scientists call such trees rooted , which means there is a single ancestral lineage ( typically drawn from the bottom or left ) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate .	0	biology
 Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya — diverge from a single point and branch off .	0	biology
 690 . A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .	1	biology
 693 . Taxonomy ( which literally means “ arrangement law ” ) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings .	1	biology
 Think about how a grocery store is organized .	0	biology
 699 . With the advancement of DNA technology , the area of molecular systematics , which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis , has blossomed .	1	biology
 New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms , but also uncover previously made errors .	0	biology
 702 . If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group , it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait .	1	biology
 The vertebrate in [ link ] is a shared ancestral character .	0	biology
 705 . Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parent(s ) to offspring .	1	biology
 These transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes , influencing their phenotypes .	0	biology
 708 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .	1	biology
 The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 711 . As shown in [ link]a , some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes , whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts .	1	biology
 This model is often called the “ web of life . ” In an effort to save the tree analogy , some have proposed using the Ficus tree ( [ link]b ) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.In the ( a ) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle , the “ tree of life ” arose from a community of ancestral cells , has multiple trunks , and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred .	1	biology
 Visually , this concept is better represented by ( b ) the multi - trunked Ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by Darwin [ link ] .	0	biology
 717 . All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .	1	biology
 The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .	0	biology
 Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “ spheres , ” whereas others are quite complex in structure . In general , the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups : filamentous , isometric ( or icosahedral ) , enveloped , and head and tail .	0	biology
 720 . Unlike nearly all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material , viruses may use either DNA or RNA as theirs .	0	biology
 The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus .	0	biology
 Viral genomes tend to be small , containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell .	0	biology
 723 . They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .	0	biology
 Group III viruses use dsRNA as their genome .	0	biology
 The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .	0	biology
 729 . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .	0	biology
 Group VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA , but are also converted back into dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase , necessary for genome replication .	0	biology
 The characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in [ link ] with examples of each group .	0	biology
 732 . These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .	1	biology
 Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .	1	biology
 The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .	0	biology
 735 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	0	biology
 738 . Sometimes , however , a virus can remain within the cell without being released .	0	biology
 For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .	0	biology
 When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .	1	biology
 741 . The viral genome is then “ injected ” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages .	0	biology
 Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors : receptor - mediated endocytosis , or fusion .	0	biology
 Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor - mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non - enveloped viruses .	0	biology
 744 . Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .	0	biology
 Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .	1	biology
 747 . When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear .	0	biology
 750 . While we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs , such as those used to treat HIV and influenza , the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination , which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses , killed viruses , or molecular subunits of the virus .	0	biology
 The killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease .	0	biology
 753 . The study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non - viral diseases .	0	biology
 Viruses have been used in gene therapy .	0	biology
 Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) , a heritable , recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems .	1	biology
 756 . Prions and viroids are pathogens ( agents with the ability to cause disease ) that have simpler structures than viruses but , in the case of prions , still can produce deadly diseases .	1	biology
 759 . ViroidsViroids are plant pathogens : small , single - stranded , circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus .	1	biology
 They do not have a capsid or outer envelope , but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell .	0	biology
 762 . The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents .	0	biology
 A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth ’s surface that releases geothermally heated water .	1	biology
 With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago , some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source — sunlight — whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food .	0	biology
 765 . Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was anoxic , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen .	1	biology
 Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .	1	biology
 Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 768 . Other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles , meaning “ lovers of extremes . ” Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments : the depth of the oceans , hot springs , the Artic and the Antarctic , in very dry places , deep inside Earth , in harsh chemical environments , and in high radiation environments ( [ link ] ) , just to mention a few .	1	biology
 These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications .	0	biology
 771 . The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood .	0	biology
 In a process called resuscitation , the prokaryote can go back to “ normal ” life when environmental conditions improve .	0	biology
 774 . For example , the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces , protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells , and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses .	0	biology
 Some species also have flagella ( singular , flagellum ) used for locomotion , and pili ( singular , pilus ) used for attachment to surfaces .	0	biology
 Plasmids , which consist of extra - chromosomal DNA , are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea .	0	biology
 777 . Bacteria are divided into two major groups : Gram positive and Gram negative , based on their reaction to Gram staining .	0	biology
 Note that all Gram - positive bacteria belong to one phylum ; bacteria in the other phyla ( Proteobacteria , Chlamydias , Spirochetes , Cyanobacteria , and others ) are Gram - negative .	1	biology
 780 . In transformation , the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes .	1	biology
 If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome , it too may become pathogenic .	0	biology
 783 . Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers .	0	biology
 For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life , they need certain substances , collectively called nutrients .	0	biology
 When prokaryotes grow in nature , they obtain their nutrients from the environment .	0	biology
 786 . Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .	0	biology
 Then , bacteria and fungi , collectively called decomposers , carry out the breakdown ( decomposition ) of plants and animals and their organic compounds .	1	biology
 The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material ( dead animals , plants , and humus ) that undergo respiration .	0	biology
 789 . Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes , yielding N2 as the final product .	0	biology
 Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate .	1	biology
 Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas , Nitrobacter , and Nitrospira .	0	biology
 792 . An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .	1	biology
 A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 An endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present , usually at low incidence , in a population .	1	biology
 795 . Therefore , changes in the environment , the pathogen , or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease .	0	biology
 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) an emerging disease ( [ link ] ) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time , or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range .	1	biology
 This definition also includes re - emerging diseases that were previously under control .	0	biology
 798 . For example , Staphylococcus aureus , often called “ staph , ” is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics .	1	biology
 A very dangerous strain , however , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) has made the news over the past few years ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics , including methicillin , amoxicillin , penicillin , and oxacillin .	0	biology
 801 . Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .	0	biology
 In the past , it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism , the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum .	1	biology
 Some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non - acidic canned foods , homemade pickles , and processed meat and sausages .	0	biology
 804 . Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free - living organisms by a factor of 10 .	0	biology
 Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules , specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Nitrogenase , the enzyme that fixes nitrogen , is inactivated by oxygen , so the nodule provides an oxygen - free area for nitrogen fixation to take place .	1	biology
 807 . In order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully , it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s ) of an alpha - proteobacterium that “ took up residence ” inside it .	0	biology
 This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis , one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit .	1	biology
 Over many generations , a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own .	0	biology
 810 . Protist cells may be enveloped by animal - like cell membranes or plant - like cell walls .	0	biology
 Others are encased in glassy silica - based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips .	0	biology
 The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor , preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion .	1	biology
 813 . Until recently , these protists were believed to lack mitochondria .	0	biology
 Mitochondrial remnant organelles , called mitosomes , have since been identified in diplomonads , but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional .	1	biology
 Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways , such as glycolysis , to generate energy .	1	biology
 816 . Together , the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates .	0	biology
 These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats , and are a component of plankton , the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms .	1	biology
 819 . Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually , although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist .	0	biology
 Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell , called a raphe .	0	biology
 By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe , the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction .	0	biology
 822 . Foraminiferans , or forams , are unicellular heterotrophic protists , ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several centimeters in length , and occasionally resembling tiny snails ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 As a group , the forams exhibit porous shells , called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate .	1	biology
 The tests may house photosynthetic algae , which the forams can harvest for nutrition .	0	biology
 825 . In addition , their mode of nutrition was poorly understood .	0	biology
 Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology : the scientific study of fungi .	1	biology
 Based on fossil evidence , fungi appeared in the pre - Cambrian era , about 450 million years ago .	0	biology
 828 . They display two distinct morphological stages : the vegetative and reproductive .	0	biology
 The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread - like structures called hyphae ( singular , hypha ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous .	1	biology
 The mass of hyphae is a mycelium ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 831 . The hyphae in bread molds ( which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota ) are not separated by septa .	0	biology
 Instead , they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei , an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae ( [ link]b ) .	0	biology
 834 . Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .	1	biology
 Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .	0	biology
 This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration , but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available .	1	biology
 837 . Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments .	0	biology
 They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium .	0	biology
 840 . Although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction , all include the following three stages ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 First , during plasmogamy ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , two haploid cells fuse , leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell .	1	biology
 During karyogamy ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus .	1	biology
 843 . The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota .	1	biology
 They include the familiar bread mold , Rhizopus stolonifer , which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads , fruits , and vegetables .	0	biology
 846 . In each ascus , two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy .	0	biology
 During sexual reproduction , thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp .	1	biology
 The diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis .	0	biology
 849 . Asexual Ascomycota and BasidiomycotaImperfect fungi — those that do not display a sexual phase — use to be classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota , , a classification group no longer used in the present , ever - developing classification of organisms .	0	biology
 While Deuteromycota use to be a classification group , recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota or the Basidiomycota classifications .	0	biology
 852 . Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .	0	biology
 It appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae : the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus , and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant . The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots .	1	biology
 Although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes , they do not form zygospores .	0	biology
 855 . Fungi can affect animals , including humans , in several ways .	0	biology
 A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage .	1	biology
 Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues .	0	biology
 858 . One of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae .	0	biology
 Mycorrhiza , which comes from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root , refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi .	1	biology
 Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners .	0	biology
 861 . Lichens display a range of colors and textures ( [ link ] ) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats .	1	biology
 They cover rocks , gravestones , tree bark , and the ground in the tundra where plant roots can not penetrate .	0	biology
 864 . In both seedless and seed plants , the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte .	1	biology
 This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes .	0	biology
 867 . After germinating from a spore , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia , usually on the same individual .	0	biology
 In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .	1	biology
 The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 870 . The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin .	1	biology
 This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids : hence the yellow color of most pollen .	0	biology
 873 . The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .	0	biology
 Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .	0	biology
 The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte .	1	biology
 876 . Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts , and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes .	1	biology
 Consequently , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta .	1	biology
 879 . The hornworts ( Anthocerotophyta ) belong to the broad bryophyte group .	0	biology
 They have colonized a variety of habitats on land , although they are never far from a source of moisture .	0	biology
 882 . The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground .	1	biology
 Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage - like structures .	0	biology
 885 . The vascular plants , or tracheophytes , are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants .	1	biology
 More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth ’s vegetation .	0	biology
 888 . Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it transports sugars , proteins , and other solutes throughout the plant .	1	biology
 Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the sieve elements .	0	biology
 891 . Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities .	0	biology
 Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins .	1	biology
 Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution .	0	biology
 894 . The club mosses , or phylum Lycopodiophyta , are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants .	1	biology
 They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous , growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests .	0	biology
 897 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Ferns)With their large fronds , ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants .	0	biology
 They are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants .	1	biology
 900 . Gymnosperms , meaning “ naked seeds , ” are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic .	1	biology
 Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor .	1	biology
 903 . The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili .	0	biology
 Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant , described as monoecious ( “ one home ” or bisexual ) , or on separate plants , referred to as dioecious ( “ two homes ” or unisexual ) plants .	1	biology
 The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms .	0	biology
 6715 . With the advent of video technology and cable television , the power of the president to reach huge audiences increased exponentially .	0	government
 President Ronald Reagan , shown here giving one of his most famous speeches in Berlin , was an expert at using technology to help mold and project his presidential image to the public .	0	government
 His training as an actor certainly helped in this regard .	0	government
 6718 . Eleanor Roosevelt took an active role in championing civil rights , becoming in some ways a bridge between her husband and the civil rights movement .	0	government
 She coordinated meetings between FDR and members of the NAACP , championed antilynching legislation , openly defied segregation laws , and pushed the Army Nurse Corps to allow black women in its ranks .	0	government
 6721 . Betty Ford took over as first lady in 1974 and became an avid advocate of women ’s rights , proclaiming that she was pro - choice when it came to abortion and lobbying for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) .	0	government
 She shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy .	0	government
 6724 . The increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the 1980s with Nancy Reagan ’s “ Just Say No ” antidrug campaign and in the early 1990s with Barbara Bush ’s efforts on behalf of literacy .	0	government
 The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success .	0	government
 Her successors , Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty - first century and Michelle Obama in the second , returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies : Laura Bush advocated literacy and education , while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise .	0	government
 6727 . Shortly after taking office , Clinton appointed the first lady to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform .	0	government
 This organization was to follow through on his campaign promise to fix the problems in the U.S. healthcare system .	0	government
 6730 . Presidents may choose to issue executive orders or proclamations to achieve policy goals .	0	government
 Usually , executive orders direct government agencies to pursue a certain course in the absence of congressional action .	0	government
 6733 . But at least one Japanese American refused to go along .	0	government
 His name was Fred Korematsu , and he decided to go into hiding in California rather than be taken to the internment camps with his family .	0	government
 He was soon discovered , turned over to the military , and sent to the internment camp in Utah that held his family .	0	government
 6736 . Presidents also issue executive agreements with foreign powers .	0	government
 Executive agreements are formal agreements negotiated between two countries but not ratified by a legislature as a treaty must be .	0	government
 6739 . Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt offered models of vigorous executive leadership , while the image and style of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan influenced and at times haunted or frustrated successors .	0	government
 Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies .

 6826 . When oral arguments have been concluded , the justices have to decide the case , and they do so in conference , which is held in private twice a week when the Court is in session and once a week when it is not .	0	government
 The conference is also a time to discuss petitions for certiorari , but for those cases already heard , each justice may state his or her views on the case , ask questions , or raise concerns .	0	government
 6829 . Likewise , the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion ; however , any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion .	0	government
 If a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority ’s reasoning in it , that justice may write a concurring opinion .	0	government
 6832 . A judge or justice who views the role with an activist lens is more likely to use his or her judicial power to broaden personal liberty , justice , and equality .	0	government
 Still others believe in judicial restraint , which leads them to defer decisions ( and thus policymaking ) to the elected branches of government and stay focused on a narrower interpretation of the Bill of Rights .	0	government
 These justices are less likely to strike down actions or laws as unconstitutional and are less likely to focus on the expansion of individual liberties .	0	government

 This distribution of authority was the result of a conscious decision and was reflected in the structure and framework of the Articles of Confederation .	0	government
 The national government was limited , lacking both a president to oversee domestic and foreign policy and a system of federal courts to settle disputes between the states .	0	government

 6937 . Once the particulars of implementation have been spelled out in the legislation authorizing a new program , bureaucracies move to enact it .	0	government
 When they encounter grey areas , many follow the federal negotiated rulemaking process to propose a solution , that is , detailing how particular new federal polices , regulations , and/or programs will be implemented in the agencies .	0	government
 Congress can not possibly legislate on that level of detail , so the experts in the bureaucracy do so .	0	government

One of the oldest and largest pieces of social welfare policy is Social Security , which cost the United States about $ 845 billion in 2014 alone.“An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook : 2014 to 2024 , ” 27 August 2014 . https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45653 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 These costs are offset by a 12.4 percent payroll tax on all wages up to $ 118,500 ; employers and workers who are not self - employed split the bill for each worker , whereas the self - employed pay their entire share.“Update 2016 , ” https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10003.pdf ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Social Security was conceived as a solution to several problems inherent to the Industrial Era economy .	0	government
 First , by the 1920s and 1930s , an increasing number of workers were earning their living through manual or day - wage labor that depended on their ability to engage in physical activity ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6973 . During the George W. Bush administration , Social Security became a highly politicized topic as the Republican Party sought to find a way of preventing what experts predicted would be the impending collapse of the Social Security system ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In 1950 , the ratio of workers paying into the program to beneficiaries receiving payments was 16.5 to 1 .	0	government
 6976 . More than 50 percent of all health care dollars spent were being spent by the U.S. government well before the ACA was enacted .	0	government
 As you have already learned , Medicare was created decades earlier .	0	government
 Despite protesters’ resistance to government involvement in health care , there is no keeping government out of Medicare ; the government IS Medicare .	0	government
 6979 . A second approach to creating public policy is a bit more objective .	0	government
 Rather than starting with what ought to happen and seeking ways to make it so , policy analysts try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision maker and then gauge their impacts if implemented .	0	government
 The goal of the analyst is n’t really to encourage the implementation of any of the options ; rather , it is to make sure decision makers are fully informed about the implications of the decisions they do make .	0	government
 6982 . Acid rain provides another nice illustration of agenda setting and the problems and solutions subphases .	0	government
 Acid rain is a widely recognized problem that did not make it on to the governmental policy agenda until Congress passed the Air Quality Act of 1967 , long after environmental groups started asking for laws to regulate pollution .	0	government
 6985 . Until the 1930s , most policy advocates argued that the best way for the government to interact with the economy was through a hands - off approach formally known as laissez - faire economics .	0	government
 These policymakers believed the key to economic growth and development was the government ’s allowing private markets to operate efficiently .	1	government
 6988 . The End of Prosperity : How Higher Taxes Will Doom the Economy .	0	government
 New York : Simon & Schuster .	0	government
 They called for an approach known as supply - side economics , which argues that economic growth is largely a function of the productive capacity of a country .	1	government
 Supply - siders have argued that increased regulation and higher taxes reduce the incentive to invest new money into the economy , to the point where little growth can occur .	0	government
 6991 . In theory , the amount of revenue raised by the national government should be equal to these expenses , but with the exception of a brief period from 1998 to 2000 , that has not been the case .	0	government
 The economic recovery from the 2007–2009 recession , and budget control efforts implemented since then , have managed to cut the annual deficit — the amount by which expenditures are greater than revenues — by more than half .	0	government
 However , the amount of money the U.S. government needed to borrow to pay its bills in 2016 was still in excess of $ 400 billion“The Federal Budget in 2015 : An Infographic , ” 6 January 2016 . www.cbo.gov/publication/51110 ( March 1 , 2016 ) . .	0	government
 6994 . Supply - siders , on the other hand , prefer regressive tax systems , which lower the overall rate as individuals make more money .	1	government
 This does not automatically mean the wealthy pay less than the poor , simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower .	0	government
 6997 . If you have read or watched the news for the past several years , perhaps you have heard the names Janet Yellen , Ben Bernanke , or Alan Greenspan .	0	government
 Bernanke and Greenspan are recent past chairs of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System ; Yellen is the current chair ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 7000 . Domestic issues can sometimes become international ones when it comes to such topics as foreign trade .	0	government
 Here , President George W. Bush shakes hands with legislators and administration officials after signing the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) Implementation Act on August 2 , 2005 .	0	government
 7003 . The payoff of stability that comes from other U.S. foreign policy goals is peace and tranquility .	0	government
 While certainly looking out for its own strategic interests in considering foreign policy strategy , the United States nonetheless attempts to support international peace through many aspects of its foreign policy , such as foreign aid , and through its support of and participation in international organizations such as the United Nations , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and the Organization of American States .	0	government

 7009 . A country is said to be engaging in protectionism when it does not permit other countries to sell goods and services within its borders , or when it charges them very high tariffs ( or import taxes ) to do so .	1	government
 At the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach , in which a country allows the unfettered flow of goods and services between itself and other countries .	1	government
 At times the United States has been free trade – oriented , while at other times it has been protectionist .	0	government
 7012 . For many , foreign policy is synonymous with diplomacy .	0	government
 Diplomacy is the establishment and maintenance of a formal relationship between countries that governs their interactions on matters as diverse as tourism , the taxation of goods they trade , and the landing of planes on each other ’s runways .	1	government
 While diplomatic relations are not always rosy , when they are operating it does suggest that things are going well between the countries .	0	government
 5808 . At this time , the idea of liberty became an important concept .	0	government
 According to John Locke , an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century , all people have natural rights to life , liberty , and property .	0	government
 From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed .	0	government
 5811 . In socialist countries , the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity , transportation systems like airlines and railroads , and telecommunications systems .	0	government
 In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy : only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government .	1	government
 For example , in China , the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party .	0	government
 5820 . Thus , U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress , the president and vice president , members of state legislatures , governors , mayors , and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf .	0	government
 Most representative governments favor majority rule : the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority .	1	government
 If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it , the law will be enacted .	0	government
 5823 . At the other end of the political spectrum are elite - driven forms of government .	0	government
 In a monarchy , one ruler , usually a hereditary ruler , holds political power .	1	government
 Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law , and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , this is not always the case .	0	government
 5826 . This belief is called the elite theory of government .	0	government
 In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government .	1	government
 Pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government .	0	government
 5829 . Rather than resting in the hands of individuals , a variety of organized groups hold power , with some groups having more influence on certain issues than others .	0	government
 Thousands of interest groups exist in the United States.“The Non - Governmental Order : Will NGOs Democratise , or Merely Disrupt , Global Governance ? ” The Economist , 9 December 1999 .	0	government
 Approximately 70–90 percent of Americans report belonging to at least one group . Ronald J. Hrebenar .	0	government
 5832 . Many of the tradeoffs made by government are about freedom of speech .	0	government
 The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .	1	government
 Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .	0	government
 5835 . Are fewer people today active in politics than in the past ?	0	government
 Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued that civic engagement is declining ; although many Americans may report belonging to groups , these groups are usually large , impersonal ones with thousands of members .	0	government
 People who join groups such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group , but they do not actually interact with these other members .	0	government
 5838 . They argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen - year - olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war .	0	government
 As a result , the Twenty - Sixth Amendment , which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen , was ratified by the states and went into effect in 1971 .	1	government
 5841 . Some people prefer even more active and direct forms of engagement such as protest marches and demonstrations , including civil disobedience .	0	government
 Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today .	0	government
 5850 . The beliefs and attitudes that led to the call for independence had long been an important part of colonial life .	0	government
 Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .	0	government
 5853 . So committed were the British to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal Stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century , Parliament removed King James II , already disliked because he was Roman Catholic , in the Glorious Revolution and invited his Protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation .	0	government
 Before offering the throne to William and Mary , however , Parliament passed the English Bill of Rights in 1689 .	0	government
 A bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections possessed by a nation ’s citizens .	1	government

 The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .	1	government
 The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .	0	government

 This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party .	0	government
 Today , many who do not agree with the positions of the Democratic or the Republican Party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the Tea Party ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 5865 . These acts virtually abolished town meetings in Massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony ’s ability to govern itself .	0	government
 This assault on Massachusetts and its economy enraged people throughout the colonies , and delegates from all the colonies except Georgia formed the First Continental Congress to create a unified opposition to Great Britain .	0	government
 Among other things , members of the institution developed a declaration of rights and grievances .	0	government
 5868 . Congress drafted a Declaration of Causes explaining the colonies’ reasons for rebellion .	0	government
 On July 2 , 1776 , Congress declared American independence from Britain and two days later signed the Declaration of Independence .	1	government
 5874 . Thus , powers given to the central government were severely limited .	0	government
 The Confederation Congress , formerly the Continental Congress , had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Indian tribes , declare war , coin currency and borrow money , and settle disputes between states .	1	government
 Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress ; these men could be recalled at any time .	0	government
 5877 . The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , already recognized by many , became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers , led by Daniel Shays .	1	government
 Known as Shays’ Rebellion , the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts , who called upon the national government for assistance .	0	government
 However , with no power to raise an army , the government had no troops at its disposal .	0	government
 5880 . All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .	0	government
 Among those not in attendance were John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats .	0	government
 Because the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation proved impossible to overcome , the convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787 decided to create an entirely new government .	0	government
 5883 . One of the first differences among the delegates to become clear was between those from large states , such as New York and Virginia , and those who represented small states , like Delaware .	0	government
 When discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution , the delegates from Virginia called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two houses .	1	government
 The number of a state ’s representatives in each house was to be based on the state ’s population .	0	government
 5889 . After debating at length over whether the Virginia Plan or the New Jersey Plan provided the best model for the nation ’s legislature , the framers of the Constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the Great Compromise , suggested by Roger Sherman of Connecticut .	0	government
 Congress , it was decided , would consist of two chambers : the Senate and the House of Representatives .	1	government
 5892 . The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .	0	government
 They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .	0	government
 5895 . In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .	1	government
 Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .	1	government
 5898 . On September 17 , 1787 , the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia voted to approve the document they had drafted over the course of many months .	0	government
 Some did not support it , but the majority did .	0	government
 5901 . Other delegates , such as Edmund Randolph of Virginia , disapproved of the Constitution because it created a new federal judicial system .	0	government
 Their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived .	0	government
 5904 . Opponents of ratification were called Anti - Federalists .	1	government
 Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .	0	government
 5907 . The approval of New York was the last major hurdle .	0	government
 Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .	0	government
 5910 . Indeed , Hamilton asked rhetorically , would American citizens best be served by a representative “ whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances ” or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world ?	0	government
 To those who argued that a merchant and land - owning elite would come to dominate Congress , Hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in New York ’s state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants , “ their natural patron[s ] and friend[s ] , ” to represent them .	0	government
 An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .	0	government
 5913 . For those who worried that the president might indeed grow too ambitious or king - like , Hamilton , in Federalist No .	0	government
 68 , provided assurance that placing the leadership of the country in the hands of one person was not dangerous .	0	government
 5919 . The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .	0	government
 Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .	0	government
 5922 . For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .	1	government
 The Fifth Amendment , which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life , liberty , or property except by a legal proceeding , was also greatly influenced by English law as well as the protections granted to Virginians in the Virginia Declaration of Rights .	1	government
 5925 . The Ninth and Tenth Amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people ’s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful .	0	government
 The Ninth Amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents .	1	government
 This was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive , and the government should not attempt to interfere with them .	0	government
 5928 . For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .	1	government
 The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .	1	government
 In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .	0	government
 5931 . The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .	1	government
 The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .	1	government
 It also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life , liberty , or property without a legal proceeding .	0	government
 5934 . Subsequent amendments further extended the suffrage .	0	government
 The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .	1	government
 The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .	1	government
 5937 . Specifically , the federal design spelled out in the Constitution divides powers between two levels of government — the states and the federal government — and creates a mechanism for them to check and balance one another .	0	government
 As an institutional design , federalism both safeguards state interests and creates a strong union led by a capable central government .	1	government
 5940 . The main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the Constitution can occur unless there is broad support within Congress and among states .	0	government
 The potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives — such as the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) , which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex — have failed because they can not garner sufficient consent among members of Congress or , in the case of the ERA , the states .	0	government
 5943 . Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .	0	government
 Since then , power has been gradually decentralized through a process of devolution , leading to the creation of regional governments in Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them .	0	government
 Other democratic countries with unitary systems , such as France , Japan , and Sweden , have followed a similar path of decentralization .	0	government
 5946 . The last clause of Article I , Section 8 , commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper cause , enables Congress “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying ” out its constitutional responsibilities .	1	government
 While the enumerated powers define the policy areas in which the national government has authority , the elastic clause allows it to create the legal means to fulfill those responsibilities .	0	government

 530 . To address this concern , Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) in 1996 .	0	government
 The law declared that “ No state ( or other political subdivision within the United States ) need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex , even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state . ” The law also barred federal benefits for same - sex partners .	1	government
 5958 . The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out - of - staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts , legal protection , property rights , and travel rights .	1	government
 The clause has not been interpreted to mean there can not be any difference in the way a state treats residents and non - residents .	0	government
 5964 . As George Washington ’s secretary of the treasury from 1789 to 1795 , Alexander Hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank .	0	government
 For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .	1	government
 Although Thomas Jefferson , Washington ’s secretary of state , staunchly opposed Hamilton ’s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument , Hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation . The Lehrman Institute .	0	government
 5967 . When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .	0	government
 However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .	0	government
 Many states rejected the Second Bank , arguing that the national government was infringing upon the states’ constitutional jurisdiction .	0	government
 5970 . Defining the scope of national power was the subject of another landmark Supreme Court decision in 1824 .	0	government
 In Gibbons v. Ogden , the court had to interpret the commerce clause of Article I , Section 8 ; specifically , it had to determine whether the federal government had the sole authority to regulate the licensing of steamboats operating between New York and New Jersey . Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .	1	government
 Aaron Ogden , who had obtained an exclusive license from New York State to operate steamboat ferries between New York City and New Jersey , sued Thomas Gibbons , who was operating ferries along the same route under a coasting license issued by the federal government .	0	government
 Gibbons lost in New York state courts and appealed .	0	government
 5973 . Various states railed against the nationalization of power that had been going on since the late 1700s .	0	government
 When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .	1	government
 In effect , these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification — that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional . W .	0	government
 5976 . Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .	0	government
 South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .	1	government
 The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833 , authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws .	0	government
 5979 . The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War .	0	government
 Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .	0	government
 But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .	0	government
 5982 . First , the Union victory put an end to the right of states to secede and to challenge legitimate national laws .	0	government
 Second , Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union ; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .	0	government
 In sum , after the Civil War the power balance shifted toward the national government , a movement that had begun several decades before with McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) and Gibbons v. Odgen ( 1824 ) .	0	government

 To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry , Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 , which created the Interstate Commerce Commission .	1	government
 Three years later , national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce ( Figure 03_02_Commerce ) .	1	government

 6012 . Federal cash grants do come with strings attached ; the national government has an interest in seeing that public monies are used for policy activities that advance national objectives .	0	government
 Categorical grants are federal transfers formulated to limit recipients’ discretion in the use of funds and subject them to strict administrative criteria that guide project selection , performance , and financial oversight , among other things .	1	government
 These grants also often require some commitment of matching funds .	0	government
 6015 . The upward slope since the 1990s is primarily due to the increase in federal grant money going to Medicaid .	0	government
 Federally funded health - care programs jumped from $ 43.8 billion in 1990 to $ 320 billion in 2014.Dilger , “ Federal Grants to State and Local Governments , ” 5 .	0	government
 Health - related grant programs such as Medicaid and the Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) represented more than half of total federal grant expenses .	0	government
 6018 . By eliminating uncapped federal funding , as the TANF issue illustrates , the national government can reverse the escalating costs of federal grant programs .	0	government
 This point has not been lost on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , former chair of the House Budget Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee , who has tried multiple times but without success to convert Medicaid into a block grant , a reform he estimates could save the federal government upwards of $ 732 billion over ten years . Jonathan Weisman , “ Ryan ’s Budget Would Cut $ 5 trillion in Spending Over a Decade , ” New York Times , 1 April 2014.Another noteworthy characteristic of block grants is that their flexibility has been undermined over time as a result of creeping categorization , a process in which the national government places new administrative requirements on state and local governments or supplants block grants with new categorical grants .

 By passing the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) in 1996 , the federal government stepped into this policy issue .	0	government
 Not only did DOMA allow states to choose whether to recognize same - sex marriages , it also defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , which meant that same - sex couples were denied various federal provisions and benefits — such as the right to file joint tax returns and receive Social Security survivor benefits .	1	government

Windsor , has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same - sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections .	0	government
 In 2007 , after having lived together since the late 1960s , Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada , where same - sex marriage was legal .	0	government
 After Spyer died in 2009 , Windsor received a $ 363,053 federal tax bill on the estate Spyer had left her .	0	government
 6039 . In 2015 , marriage equality was recognized in thirty - six states plus Washington , DC , up from seventeen in 2013 .	0	government
 The diffusion of marriage equality across states was driven in large part by federal district and appeals courts , which have used the rationale underpinning the Windsor case ( i.e. , laws can not discriminate between same - sex and opposite - sex couples based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ) to invalidate state bans on same - sex marriage .	0	government
 The 2014 court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same - sex marriage in thirty states .	0	government

 In 1984 , the federal government passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act ( NMDAA ) , a crosscutting mandate that gradually reduced federal highway grant money to any state that failed to increase the legal age for alcohol purchase and possession to twenty - one .	1	government
 After losing a legal battle against the NMDAA , all states were in compliance by 1988.South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203 ( 1987 ) .	0	government
 6045 . Among the merits of federalism are that it promotes policy innovation and political participation and accommodates diversity of opinion .	0	government
 On the subject of policy innovation , Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis observed in 1932 that “ a single courageous state may , if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann , 285 U.S. 262 ( 1932 ) .	0	government
 What Brandeis meant was that states could harness their constitutional authority to engage in policy innovations that might eventually be diffused to other states and at the national level .	0	government
 For example , a number of New Deal breakthroughs , such as child labor laws , were inspired by state policies .	0	government

 To be more precise in their language , political scientists and legal experts make a distinction between civil liberties and civil rights , even though the Constitution has been interpreted to protect both .	0	government
 We typically envision civil liberties as being limitations on government power , intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on .	1	government
 For example , the First Amendment denies the government the power to prohibit “ the free exercise ” of religion ; the states and the national government can not forbid people to follow a religion of their choice , even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided , blasphemous , or otherwise inappropriate .	0	government

 6057 . A bill of attainder is a law that convicts or punishes someone for a crime without a trial , a tactic used fairly frequently in England against the king ’s enemies .	1	government
 Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes .	0	government
 6060 . Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .	0	government
 For example , during the Civil War , President Abraham Lincoln detained suspected Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in Union - controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts , leading the Supreme Court to rule in Ex parte Milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating . Ex parte Milligan , 71 U.S. 2 ( 1866 ) .	0	government
 6063 . 84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .	0	government
 Later , James Madison , in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the Bill of Rights , acknowledged another Federalist argument : “ It has been said , that a bill of rights is not necessary , because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions.”American History from Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond , “ Madison Speech Proposing the Bill of Rights June 8 1789 , ” http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/madison-speech-proposing-the-bill-of-rights-june-8-1789.php ( March 4 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 For that matter , the Articles of Confederation had not included a specific listing of rights either .	0	government
 6066 . Ultimately , James Madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the First Congress , drawing from the Declaration of Rights in the Virginia state constitution , suggestions from the ratification conventions , and other sources , which were extensively debated in both houses of Congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states .	0	government
 Ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite 75 percent of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 6069 . In the wake of the Civil War , however , the prevailing thinking about the application of the Bill of Rights to the states changed .	0	government
 Soon after slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment , state governments — particularly those in the former Confederacy — began to pass “ black codes ” that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively relegated them to second - class citizenship under their state laws and constitutions .	1	government
 Angered by these actions , members of the Radical Republican faction in Congress demanded that the laws be overturned .	0	government
 6075 . Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .	0	government
 In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another . Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .	0	government
 More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .	1	government
 Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .	0	government
 6081 . We can broadly divide the provisions of the Bill of Rights into three categories .	0	government
 The First , Second , Third , and Fourth Amendments protect basic individual freedoms ; the Fourth ( partly ) , Fifth , Sixth , Seventh , and Eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity ; and the Ninth and Tenth , are consistent with the framers’ view that the Bill of Rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6084 . At the same time , public schooling was beginning to take root on a wide scale .	0	government
 Since most states had traditional Protestant majorities and most state officials were Protestants themselves , the public school curriculum incorporated many Protestant features ; at times , these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other Christian sects or from other religious traditions . The establishment clause today tends to be interpreted a bit more broadly than in the past ; it not only forbids the creation of a “ Church of the United States ” or “ Church of Ohio ” it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion ( of any variety ) over non - religion .	0	government
 Thus , the government can not promote , say , Islamic beliefs over Sikh beliefs or belief in God over atheism or agnosticism ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6087 . The free exercise clause , on the other hand , limits the ability of the government to control or restrict religious practices .	1	government
 This portion of the First Amendment regulates not the government ’s promotion of religion , but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices .	0	government
 6090 . In the 1960s and 1970s , the court decided two cases in which it laid out a general test for deciding similar cases in the future .	0	government
 In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .	0	government
 It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ” In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .	1	government
 This standard became known as the Sherbert test .	0	government
 6093 . But because it replaced the Sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices , followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws , even ones neutral on their face , might be used to curtail their religious practices .	0	government
 In 1993 , in response to this decision , Congress passed a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , which was followed in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act after part of the RFRA was struck down by the Supreme Court .	0	government
 In addition , since 1990 , twenty - one states have passed state RFRAs that include the Sherbert test in state law , and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the Sherbert test ’s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law . Juliet Eilperin , “ 31 states have heightened religious freedom protections , ” Washington Post , 1 March 2014 . http://www.washingtonpost.com / blogs / the - fix / wp/2014/03/01/where - in - the - u - s - are - there - heightened - protections - for - religious - freedom/ .	0	government
 6096 . Proponents of state RFRA laws argued that people and businesses ought not be compelled to endorse practices their religious beliefs held to be immoral or indecent and feared clergy might be compelled to officiate same - sex marriages against their religion ’s teachings .	0	government
 Opponents of RFRA laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required , per Obergefell v. Hodges , to serve same - sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the civil rights of gays and lesbians , just as they would be obliged to cater or photograph an interracial marriage . Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2015 ) .	0	government
 6099 . In the 1960s , however , the Supreme Court ’s rulings on free expression became more liberal , in response to the Vietnam War and the growing antiwar movement .	0	government
 In a 1969 case involving the Ku Klux Klan , Brandenburg v. Ohio , the Supreme Court found that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action , an illegal act in the immediate future , could be suppressed ; the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough . Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 ( 1969 ) .	1	government
 The Supreme Court also found that various forms of symbolic speech — wearing clothing like an armband that carried a political symbol or raising a fist in the air , for example — were subject to the same protections as written and spoken communication .	0	government
 6102 . This court decision was strongly criticized , and Congress responded by passing a federal law , the Flag Protection Act , intended to overrule it ; the act , too , was struck down as unconstitutional in 1990.United States v. Eichman , 496 U.S. 310 ( 1990 ) .	0	government
 Since then , Congress has attempted on several occasions to propose constitutional amendments allowing the states and federal government to re - criminalize flag desecration — to no avail .	0	government
 6105 . More specifically , the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 .	0	government
 Daniel Ellsberg famously released passages of the Papers to the press to show that the United States had secretly enlarged the scope of the war by bombing Cambodia and Laos among other deeds while lying to the American public about doing so .	0	government
 5301 . In short , collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution .	1	sociology
 There are three primary forms of collective behavior : the crowd , the mass , and the public . It takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a crowd ( Lofland 1993 ) .	0	sociology
 Examples include a group of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert , tailgating at a Patriots game , or attending a worship service .	0	sociology
 5304 . Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .	1	sociology
 The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .	1	sociology
 5313 . Sociologist David Aberle ( 1966 ) addresses this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want .	0	sociology
 Reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure .	1	sociology
 Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .	0	sociology
 5319 . Resource Mobilization and the Civil Rights MovementAn example of resource mobilization theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the mid 1950s and the mid 1960s .	0	sociology
 Social movements had existed before , notably the Women 's Suffrage Movement and a long line of labor movements , thus constituting an existing social movement sector , which is the multiple social movement industries in a society , even if they have widely varying constituents and goals .	0	sociology
 The civil rights movement had also existed well before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man .	0	sociology
 5322 . The anti - gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman .	1	sociology
 Prognostic framing , the second type , offers a solution and states how it will be implemented .	1	sociology
 Some examples of this frame , when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti - gay marriage movement , include the plan to restrict marriage to “ one man / one woman ” or to allow only “ civil unions ” instead of marriages .	0	sociology
 5325 . New social movement theory , a development of European social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s , attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories .	1	sociology
 Rather than being one specific theory , it is more of a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics , identity , culture , and social change .	0	sociology
 5328 . Modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to a developed , technologically driven society ( Irwin 1975 ) .	1	sociology
 By this definition , the level of modernity within a society is judged by the sophistication of its technology , particularly as it relates to infrastructure , industry , and the like .	0	sociology
 5331 . Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists working from the micro - level study small groups and individual interactions , while those using macro - level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies .	0	sociology
 For example , a micro - level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals .	0	sociology
 5334 . Remember , though , that culture is a product of the people in a society ; sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “ culture ” as though it were alive in its own right .	1	sociology
 Reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real , material existence ( Sahn 2013 ) .	1	sociology
" 5340 . In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to "" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """	1	sociology
 He and other like - minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes , cultural norms , and societal values .	1	sociology
 This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict ( traditional in science ) , but to systematically gain an in - depth understanding of social worlds .	0	sociology
 5343 . Sociologists study social events , interactions , and patterns , and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do .	1	sociology
 In sociology , a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition , called a hypothesis , about society ( Allan 2006 ) .	1	sociology
 5346 . Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current , but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them ( Calhoun 2002).In sociology , a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life , and these are called paradigms .	1	sociology
 Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories , generalizations , and the experiments performed in support of them .	0	sociology
 Three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking , because they provide useful explanations : structural functionalism , conflict theory , and symbolic interactionism .	0	sociology
 5349 . He believed that to study society , a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashion , and rituals , which all serve to govern social life .	0	sociology
 Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .	0	sociology
 In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .	1	sociology
 5352 . Another noted structural functionalist , Robert Merton ( 1910–2003 ) , pointed out that social processes often have many functions .	0	sociology
 Manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated , while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process .	1	sociology
 A manifest function of college education , for example , includes gaining knowledge , preparing for a career , and finding a good job that utilizes that education .	0	sociology
 5355 . conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability .	0	sociology
 Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest . Symbolic Interactionist TheorySymbolic interactionism is a micro - level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society .	1	sociology
 Communication — the exchange of meaning through language and symbols — is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds .	1	sociology
 5358 . Sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions , such as these and more , about our social world . We often have opinions about social situations , but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data .	0	sociology
 Instead , scientific research is based on empirical evidence , which is evidence that comes from direct experience , scientifically gathered data , or experimentation .	1	sociology
 Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .	0	sociology
 5361 . A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .	1	sociology
 Sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method , or an interpretative framework , to increase understanding of societies and social interactions , but research begins with the search for an answer to a question .	0	sociology
 5364 . Sociologists do not rule out any topic , but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms . That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms .	0	sociology
 In a hygiene study , for instance , hygiene could be defined as “ personal habits to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might ask , “ How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ” When forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an operational definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it .	1	sociology
 The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept .	0	sociology
 5367 . In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .	0	sociology
 In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .	1	sociology
 The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .	1	sociology
 5370 . A researcher would n’t stroll into a crime - ridden neighborhood at midnight , calling out , “ Any gang members around ? ” And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency , the self - conscious , intimidated baristas might not behave naturally .	0	sociology
 This is called the Hawthorne effect — where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study .	1	sociology
 The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research .	0	sociology
 5373 . Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors ( such as sleeping , driving , or texting habits ) or factual information such as employment status , income , and education levels .	0	sociology
 A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .	1	sociology
 Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .	1	sociology
 5376 . For some topics , the researcher might ask yes - or - no or multiple - choice questions , allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question .	0	sociology
 This kind of quantitative data — research collected in numerical form that can be counted — are easy to tabulate .	1	sociology
 Just count up the number of “ yes ” and “ no ” responses or correct answers , and chart them into percentages . Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers — beyond “ yes , ” “ no , ” or the option next to a checkbox .	0	sociology
 5379 . They meet subjects where they live , work , and play .	0	sociology
 Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey .	1	sociology
 It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method .	0	sociology
 5382 . Ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting .	1	sociology
 Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community .	0	sociology
 5385 . While sociologists often engage in original research studies , they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis .	0	sociology
 Secondary data does n’t result from firsthand research collected from primary sources , but are the already completed work of other researchers .	1	sociology
 5388 . The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well .	0	sociology
 The ASA maintains a code of ethics — formal guidelines for conducting sociological research — consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline .	1	sociology
 It also describes procedures for filing , investigating , and resolving complaints of unethical conduct .	0	sociology
 5391 . In everyday conversation , people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society , but the terms have slightly different meanings , and the distinction is important to a sociologist .	0	sociology
 A society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture .	1	sociology
 By “ community , ” sociologists refer to a definable region — as small as a neighborhood ( Brooklyn , or “ the east side of town ” ) , as large as a country ( Ethiopia , the United States , or Nepal ) , or somewhere in between ( in the United States , this might include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society ) .	1	sociology
 5394 . cultural imperialism , the deliberate imposition of one ’s own cultural values on another culture .	1	sociology
 Europe ’s colonial expansion , begun in the sixteenth century , was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism .	0	sociology
 5397 . Values often suggest how people should behave , but they do n’t accurately reflect how people do behave .	0	sociology
 Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .	1	sociology
 But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .	0	sociology
 5400 . People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .	0	sociology
 Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions : good grades , for instance , may mean praise from parents and teachers .	0	sociology
 5403 . There are plenty of formal norms , but the list of informal norms — casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to — is longer .	1	sociology
 People learn informal norms by observation , imitation , and general socialization .	0	sociology
 5406 . Humans , consciously and subconsciously , are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world .	0	sociology
 Symbols — such as gestures , signs , objects , signals , and words — help people understand that world .	0	sociology
 They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies .	1	sociology
 5409 . In each pair , one type of entertainment is considered high - brow and the other low - brow .	0	sociology
 Sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society .	1	sociology
 People often associate high culture with intellectualism , political power , and prestige .	0	sociology
 5412 . Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures , which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture ’s norms and values .	1	sociology
 In contrast to subcultures , which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society , countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society .	0	sociology
 5415 . Inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts — when things are put together in an entirely new manner .	1	sociology
 In the late 1800s and early 1900s , electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace .	0	sociology
 5418 . Today , many U.S. companies set up offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper .	0	sociology
 When a person in the United States calls to get information about banking , insurance , or computer services , the person taking that call may be working in another country . Alongside the process of globalization is diffusion , or the spread of material and nonmaterial culture .	1	sociology
 While globalization refers to the integration of markets , diffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures .	1	sociology
 5421 . Roughly 7,500 years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants .	0	sociology
 Pastoral societies , such as the Maasai villagers , rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival .	1	sociology
 Unlike earlier hunter - gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive , pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food , clothing , and transportation , and they created a surplus of goods .	1	sociology
 5424 . The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies .	0	sociology
 These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection .	1	sociology
 5427 . He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’s actions .	0	sociology
 Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience .	1	sociology
 In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	0	sociology
 5430 . This type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a low division of labor created shared morals and values among people , such as hunter - gatherer groups .	0	sociology
 When people tend to do the same type of work , Durkheim argued , they tend to think and act alike . In industrial societies , mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity , which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences .	1	sociology
 In capitalist societies , Durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things .	0	sociology
 5433 . Marx ’s colleague and friend , Frederick Engels , wrote The Condition of the Working - Class in England in 1844 , which described in detail the horrid conditions . Such is the Old Town of Manchester , and on re - reading my description , I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated , it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth , ruin , and uninhabitableness , the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness , ventilation , and health which characterise the construction of this single district , containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants .	0	sociology
 And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England , the first manufacturing city of the world . Add to that the long hours , the use of child labor , and exposure to extreme conditions of heat , cold , and toxic chemicals , and it is no wonder that Marx and Engels referred to capitalism , which is a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products ( such as land , oil , factories , ships , etc . )	1	sociology
 are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government , as the “ dictatorship of the bourgeoisie . ” Karl Marx ( left ) and Friedrich Engels ( right ) analyzed differences in social power between “ have ” and “ have - not ” groups .	0	sociology
 5436 . In order for society to overcome false consciousness , Marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness , the awareness of one ’s rank in society .	1	sociology
 Instead of existing as a “ class in itself , ” the proletariat must become a “ class for itself ” in order to produce social change ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) , meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society , the class could become an advocate for social improvements .	1	sociology
 5439 . In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social Construction of Reality .	0	sociology
 In it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call habitualization .	0	sociology
 Habitualization describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern , which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort ” ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) .	1	sociology
 5442 . That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .	0	sociology
 For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially was n’t a part of his character . Like Berger and Luckmann in their description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation . ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K. Merton as a self - fulfilling prophecy .	0	sociology
 Merton explains that with a self - fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon .	0	sociology
 5445 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .	1	sociology
 Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .	1	sociology
 5448 . Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .	0	sociology
 If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .	1	sociology
 Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .	0	sociology
 5451 . Goffman ’s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of Charles Cooley and the looking - glass self .	0	sociology
 According to Cooley , we base our image on what we think other people see ( Cooley 1902 ) .	0	sociology
 5454 . A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .	1	sociology
 An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .	1	sociology
 Displaced persons have fled their homes while remaining inside their country ’s borders .	1	sociology
 5457 . Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .	0	sociology
 Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	1	sociology
 New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .	1	sociology
 5460 . As cities evolve from manufacturing - based industrial to service- and information - based postindustrial societies , gentrification becomes more common .	0	sociology
 Gentrification occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and renovate city areas that have been historically less affluent while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those neighborhoods for increasingly decaying portions of the city .	1	sociology
 Globally , 54 percent of the world ’s 7 billion people currently reside in urban areas , with the most urbanized region being North America ( 82 percent ) , followed by Latin America / the Caribbean ( 80 percent ) , with Europe coming in third ( 72 percent ) .	0	sociology
 5463 . The challenge for a human ecologist working in U.S. urban planning is to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty , while also figuring out how to provide for free - flowing transport of innumerable vehicles , not to mention parking !	0	sociology
 The concentric zone model ( Burgess 1925 ) is perhaps the most famous example of human ecology .	0	sociology
 This model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas , expanding outward from the center of the city , with various “ zones ” invading adjacent zones ( as new categories of people and businesses overrun the edges of nearby zones ) and succeeding ( then after invasion , the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants ) .	1	sociology
 5466 . The GCCI is a United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi - peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative , low - carbon , energy sources with financial incentives .	0	sociology
 Programming is organized around three pillars : ( 1 ) climate change adaptation , ( 2 ) clean energy , and ( 3 ) sustainable landscapes ( Troilo 2012).PollutionPollution describes what happens when contaminants are introduced into an environment ( water , air , land ) at levels that are damaging .	1	sociology
 Environments can often sustain a limited amount of contaminants without marked change , and water , air , and soil can “ heal ” themselves to a certain degree .	0	sociology
 5469 . Environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods ( populated primarily by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups ) are burdened with a disproportionate number of hazards , including toxic waste facilities , garbage dumps , and other sources of environmental pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life .	1	sociology
 All around the globe , members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution .	0	sociology
 5472 . To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .	1	sociology
 Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .	1	sociology
 The fertility number is generally lower than the fecundity number , which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of childbearing age .	1	sociology
 5475 . This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .	0	sociology
 The population composition includes the sex ratio , the number of men for every hundred women , as well as the population pyramid , a picture of population distribution by sex and age ( [ link]).This population pyramid shows the breakdown of the 2010 U.S. population according to age and sex .	1	sociology

 5478 . Of course , some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world ’s population will meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself .	0	sociology
 Cornucopian theory scoffs at the idea of humans wiping themselves out ; it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues that develop .	1	sociology
 As an example , it points to the issue of food supply .	0	sociology
 5481 . They learn to understand interactions involving different people with a variety of purposes .	0	sociology
 For example , a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience ( someone seats you , another takes your order , someone else cooks the food , while yet another clears away dirty dishes).Finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the generalized other , the common behavioral expectations of general society .	0	sociology
 By this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( Mead 1934 ; Mead 1964).Kohlberg ’s Theory of Moral Development	1	sociology
 5484 . According to this belief , our temperaments , interests , and talents are set before birth .	0	sociology
 From this perspective , then , who we are depends on nature .	0	sociology
 5487 . In the process of resocialization , old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use .	1	sociology
 Resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center , goes to boarding school , or serves time in jail .	0	sociology
 5490 . School and classroom rituals , led by teachers serving as role models and leaders , regularly reinforce what society expects from children .	1	sociology
 Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum , the informal teaching done by schools .	1	sociology
 5493 . A rally is usually a one - time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party does n’t imply interaction with others .	0	sociology
 People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd .	1	sociology
 Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .	0	sociology
 5496 . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face - to - face in long - term emotional ways .	1	sociology
 This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones .	0	sociology
 The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization .	0	sociology
 5499 . A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement .	1	sociology
 In U.S. society , peer groups are common reference groups .	0	sociology
 5502 . Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .	1	sociology
 An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .	1	sociology
 We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .	0	sociology
 5505 . Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .	0	sociology
 Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .	1	sociology
 They work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward .	0	sociology
 5508 . She would n’t want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes .	0	sociology
 Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations .	1	sociology
 As you might recall , we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act , to dress , and to behave .	0	sociology
 5511 . Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories .	0	sociology
 Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests .	1	sociology
 As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way .	0	sociology
 5514 . A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .	1	sociology
 The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward .	1	sociology
 High school and the workplace fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money .	0	sociology
 5517 . The existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined , written down , and standardized .	1	sociology
 For example , at your college or university , the student guidelines are contained within the Student Handbook .	0	sociology
 5520 . While ostensibly based on meritocracy , bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths .	0	sociology
 Michels ( 1911 ) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the Iron Rule of Oligarchy , wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites .	1	sociology
 Do you think this is true ?	0	sociology
 5523 . An adult belching loudly is avoided .	0	sociology
 All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .	1	sociology
 The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .	1	sociology
 5526 . Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .	0	sociology
 Positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms .	1	sociology
 A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .	0	sociology
 5529 . Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .	0	sociology
 For example , wearing flip - flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands , whereas behavior that is seen as positive — such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street — may receive positive informal reactions , such as a smile or pat on the back . Formal sanctions , on the other hand , are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations .	1	sociology
 If a student violates her college ’s code of conduct , for example , she might be expelled .	0	sociology
 5532 . Cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower - class society causes crime .	1	sociology
 Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay ( 1942 ) studied crime patterns in Chicago in the early 1900s .	0	sociology
 5535 . In his book The Power Elite ( 1956 ) , sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he dubbed the power elite , a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources .	1	sociology
 Wealthy executives , politicians , celebrities , and military leaders often have access to national and international power , and in some cases , their decisions affect everyone in society .	0	sociology
 5538 . Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future . Sometimes , in more extreme cases , primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance .	0	sociology
 Secondary deviance occurs when a person ’s self - concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society .	1	sociology
 The person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a “ deviant ” as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such .	0	sociology
 5541 . Although deviance is a violation of social norms , it ’s not always punishable , and it ’s not necessarily bad .	1	sociology
 Crime , on the other hand , is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable through formal sanctions .	1	sociology
 Walking to class backward is a deviant behavior .	0	sociology
 5544 . Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .	0	sociology
 Nonviolent crimes involve the destruction or theft of property but do not use force or the threat of force .	1	sociology
 Because of this , they are also sometimes called “ property crimes . ” Larceny , car theft , and vandalism are all types of nonviolent crimes .	0	sociology
 5547 . Although these types of offenses rarely receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes , they can be far more damaging .	0	sociology
 Financial frauds such as insurance scams , Ponzi schemes , and improper practices by banks can devastate families who lose their savings or home . An often - debated third type of crime is victimless crime .	0	sociology
 Crimes are called victimless when the perpetrator is not explicitly harming another person .	1	sociology
 5550 . The U.S. Criminal Justice SystemA criminal justice system is an organization that exists to enforce a legal code .	1	sociology
 There are three branches of the U.S. criminal justice system : the police , the courts , and the corrections system .	0	sociology
 5553 . The corrections system , more commonly known as the prison system , is charged with supervising individuals who have been arrested , convicted , and sentenced for a criminal offense .	1	sociology
 At the end of 2010 , approximately seven million U.S. men and women were behind bars ( BJS 2011d ) .	0	sociology
 5556 . Those students with more exposure gain more proficiency , which makes them far more marketable in an increasingly technology - based job market and leaves our society divided into those with technological knowledge and those without .	0	sociology
 Even as we improve access , we have failed to address an increasingly evident gap in e - readiness — the ability to sort through , interpret , and process knowledge ( Sciadas 2003).Since the beginning of the millennium , social science researchers have tried to bring attention to the digital divide , the uneven access to technology among different races , classes , and geographic areas .	1	sociology
 The term became part of the common lexicon in 1996 , when then Vice President Al Gore used it in a speech .	0	sociology
 5559 . However , this exemption is temporary and relative to the severity of the illness .	0	sociology
 The exemption also requires legitimation by a physician ; that is , a physician must certify that the illness is genuine .	0	sociology
 5562 . The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .	1	sociology
 A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .	1	sociology
 Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( Conrad and Schneider 1992 ) .	0	sociology
 5565 . It expands eligibility to programs like Medicaid and CHIP , helps guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre - existing conditions , and establishes regulations to make sure that the premium funds collected by insurers and care providers go directly to medical care .	0	sociology
 It also includes an individual mandate , which requires everyone to have insurance coverage by 2014 or pay a penalty .	0	sociology
 A series of provisions , including significant subsidies , are intended to address the discrepancies in income that are currently contributing to high rates of uninsurance and underinsurance .	0	sociology
 5568 . Again , the lowest - income countries , especially in the African region , experience the worst problems with disease .	0	sociology
 An important component of disease prevention and control is epidemiology , or the study of the incidence , distribution , and possible control of diseases .	1	sociology
 Fear of Ebola contamination , primarily in Western Africa but also to a smaller degree in the United States , became national news in the summer and fall of 2014.Summary	0	sociology
 5571 . She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis , saying that it predisposes many people , both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy , against women who have been so diagnosed ( Becker).Many critics also point to the medicalization of women ’s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism .	0	sociology
 Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy .	1	sociology
 Historically and contemporaneously , many aspects of women ’s lives have been medicalized , including menstruation , pre - menstrual syndrome , pregnancy , childbirth , and menopause .	0	sociology
 5574 . And bipolar disorder is characterized by dramatic shifts in energy and mood , often affecting the individual ’s ability to carry out day - to - day tasks .	1	sociology
 Bipolar disorder used to be called manic depression because of the way people would swing between manic and depressive episodes . Depending on what definition is used , there is some overlap between mood disorders and personality disorders , which affect 9 percent of people in the United States yearly .	0	sociology
 The American Psychological Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , and their definition of personality disorders is changing in the fifth edition , which is being revised in 2011 and 2012 .	0	sociology
 5577 . Ramps on sidewalks , Braille instructions , and more accessible door levers are all accommodations to help people with disabilities . People with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illnesses .	0	sociology
 Stigmatization means their identity is spoiled ; they are labeled as different , discriminated against , and sometimes even shunned .	1	sociology
 They are labeled ( as an interactionist might point out ) and ascribed a master status ( as a functionalist might note ) , becoming “ the blind girl ” or “ the boy in the wheelchair ” instead of someone afforded a full identity by society .	0	sociology
 5580 . If sociology is the systematic study of human behavior in society , medical sociology is the systematic study of how humans manage issues of health and illness , disease and disorders , and healthcare for both the sick and the healthy .	1	sociology
 Medical sociologists study the physical , mental , and social components of health and illness .	1	sociology
 5583 . Technology and the media are interwoven , and neither can be separated from contemporary society in most core and semi - peripheral nations .	0	sociology
 Media is a term that refers to all print , digital , and electronic means of communication .	1	sociology
 From the time the printing press was created ( and even before ) , technology has influenced how and where information is shared .	0	sociology
 5586 . Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .	0	sociology
 Plant patents , the final type , recognize the discovery of new plant types that can be asexually reproduced .	1	sociology
 While genetically modified food is the hot - button issue within this category , farmers have long been creating new hybrids and patenting them .	0	sociology
 5589 . And appliance repair people say that while they might be fixing some machines that are twenty years old , they generally are n’t fixing those that are seven years old ; newer models are built to be thrown out .	0	sociology
 This strategy is called planned obsolescence , and it is the business practice of planning for a product to be obsolete or unusable from the time it is created .	1	sociology
 To some extent , planned obsolescence is a natural extension of new and emerging technologies .	0	sociology
 5592 . Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .	1	sociology
 This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .	0	sociology
 In 1983 , a mere 50 corporations owned the bulk of mass - media outlets .	0	sociology
 5595 . Powerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over which forms of technology are released , when and where they are released , and what kind of media is available for our consumption , which is a form of gatekeeping .	0	sociology
 Shoemaker and Vos ( 2009 ) define gatekeeping as the sorting process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media - appropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount .	1	sociology
 In other words , the people in charge of the media decide what the public is exposed to , which , as C. Wright Mills ( 1956 ) famously noted , is the heart of media ’s power .	0	sociology
 5598 . The kind of computer you own , the kind of car you drive , your ability to afford the latest Apple product — these serve as a social indicator of wealth and status .	0	sociology
 Neo - Luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life .	1	sociology
 But for technophiles , technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future .	1	sociology
 303 . There are five major chlorophylls : a , b , c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll .	0	biology
 Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion . With dozens of different forms , carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments .	0	biology
 The carotenoids found in fruit — such as the red of tomato ( lycopene ) , the yellow of corn seeds ( zeaxanthin ) , or the orange of an orange peel ( β - carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers .	0	biology
 306 . When studying a photosynthetic organism , scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra .	0	biology
 An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb .	1	biology
 Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption .	0	biology
 312 . It is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .	0	biology
 All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long - term storage in the form of a carbohydrate . PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , which also includes the cytochrome complex .	0	biology
 The cytochrome complex , an enzyme composed of two protein complexes , transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone ( Pq ) to the protein plastocyanin ( Pc ) , thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI .	1	biology
 315 . These reactions actually have several names associated with them .	0	biology
 Another term , the Calvin cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle .	0	biology
 Others call it the Calvin - Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery .	0	biology
 318 . There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells .	0	biology
 Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .	1	biology
" An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands ."	0	biology
 321 . Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 Ligands interact with proteins in target cells , which are cells that are affected by chemical signals ; these proteins are also called receptors .	1	biology
 Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties ; however , a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand .	0	biology
 324 . Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .	0	biology
 When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .	1	biology
 The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 327 . Autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released .	1	biology
 This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell ( the prefix auto- means self , a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself ) .	0	biology
 330 . Cell - surface receptors , also known as transmembrane receptors , are cell surface , membrane - anchored ( integral ) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules .	1	biology
 This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction , in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal .	1	biology
 333 . G - protein - linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G - protein .	1	biology
 The activated G - protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 336 . Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins .	0	biology
 In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .	1	biology
 A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .	1	biology
 339 . This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types .	0	biology
 Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways , in which signals from two or more different cell - surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell .	1	biology
 This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response .	0	biology
 342 . The response to the increase in Ca2 + varies , depending on the cell type involved .	0	biology
 For example , in the β - cells of the pancreas , Ca2 + signaling leads to the release of insulin , and in muscle cells , an increase in Ca2 + leads to muscle contractions . Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .	1	biology
 Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 345 . The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers .	0	biology
 348 . When a cell is damaged , superfluous , or potentially dangerous to an organism , a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death , or apoptosis .	1	biology
 Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell .	0	biology
 351 . Budding yeasts ( [ link ] ) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells ( cells with one - half the normal number of chromosomes ) combining to form a diploid cell ( a cell with two sets of each chromosome , which is what normal body cells contain ) .	1	biology
 In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate , budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor .	0	biology
 When mating factor binds to cell - surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby , they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP - binding proteins that are similar to G - proteins .	0	biology
 354 . The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle .	0	biology
 The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell ’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells .	1	biology
 The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated .	0	biology
 357 . Human body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .	0	biology
 A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .	1	biology
 The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .	0	biology
 360 . Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes .	1	biology
 Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .	0	biology
 Genes , the functional units of chromosomes , determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins .	1	biology
 363 . DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase .	0	biology
 After replication , the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids .	0	biology
 When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .	0	biology
 369 . Throughout interphase , nuclear DNA remains in a semi - condensed chromatin configuration .	0	biology
 In the S phase , DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules — sister chromatids — that are firmly attached to the centromeric region .	1	biology
 The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .	0	biology
 372 . In the G2 phase , the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation .	1	biology
 Some cell organelles are duplicated , and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase .	0	biology
 375 . During prophase , the “ first phase , ” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles , and the membranous organelles ( such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus , and endoplasmic reticulum ) , fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell .	1	biology
 The nucleolus disappears ( disperses ) .	0	biology
 378 . Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete .	0	biology
 Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules .	0	biology
 381 . During telophase , the “ distance phase , ” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense ( unravel ) , relaxing into a chromatin configuration .	1	biology
 The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell .	0	biology
 384 . During telophase , these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast ( a vesicular structure ) at the metaphase plate .	0	biology
 There , the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls ; this structure is called a cell plate .	1	biology
 As more vesicles fuse , the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell .	0	biology
 387 . The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .	1	biology
 Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .	1	biology
 393 . Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell .	1	biology
 This type of cell division is called binary ( prokaryotic ) fission . Binary Fission	0	biology
 396 . Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .	0	biology
 A septum is formed between the nucleoids , extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell .	0	biology
 When the new cell walls are in place , the daughter cells separate .	0	biology
 399 . Haploid cells , containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome , are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores .	0	biology
 Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell .	1	biology
 All animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm , or gametes .	0	biology
 405 . The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .	1	biology
 The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .	1	biology
 In synapsis , the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other .	0	biology
 408 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .	1	biology
 These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .	0	biology
 Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid , the double - stranded DNA is cleaved , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non - sister chromatids .	0	biology
 411 . When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another , the ploidy level — the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus — has been reduced from two to one .	1	biology
 For this reason , meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division .	0	biology
 There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis .	0	biology
 414 . Nearly all animals employ a diploid - dominant life - cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes .	1	biology
 Early in the development of the embryo , specialized diploid cells , called germ cells , are produced within the gonads , such as the testes and ovaries .	1	biology
 Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes .	0	biology
 417 . Supported by the monastery , he taught physics , botany , and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels .	0	biology
 In 1856 , he began a decade - long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants , ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system ( a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems ) .	1	biology
 In 1865 , Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society .	0	biology
 420 . Mendel was the first researcher to see it .	0	biology
 Instead of continuous characteristics , Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes ( specifically , violet versus white flowers ) ; this is referred to as discontinuous variation .	1	biology
 Mendel ’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring , nor were they absorbed , but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on .	0	biology
 423 . Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .	1	biology
 These offspring were called the F1 , or the first filial ( filial = offspring , daughter or son ) , generation .	0	biology
 Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .	0	biology
 426 . When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa , he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent , male or female , contributed which trait .	0	biology
 This is called a reciprocal cross — a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross .	1	biology
 For the other six characteristics Mendel examined , the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color .	0	biology
 429 . The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics .	0	biology
 The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone .	1	biology
 432 . Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics .	0	biology
 The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .	1	biology
 An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .	1	biology
 435 . Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .	0	biology
 When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross - fertilized , all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait , meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined .	0	biology
 438 . Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents , Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote .	1	biology
 Called the test cross , this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders .	0	biology
 In a test cross , the dominant - expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic .	0	biology
 441 . A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance , in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote .	1	biology
 An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans .	0	biology
 444 . The sex chromosomes are one pair of non - homologous chromosomes .	0	biology
 Until now , we have only considered inheritance patterns among non - sex chromosomes , or autosomes .	0	biology
 In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes , human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes , whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair .	1	biology
 447 . Because the gene is essential , these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization , die in utero , or die later in life , depending on what life stage requires this gene .	0	biology
 An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non - lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal . For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous , only wild - type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed .	1	biology
 The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1 .	0	biology
 450 . Observing that true - breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio , Mendel proposed the law of segregation .	0	biology
 This law states that paired unit factors ( genes ) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor .	1	biology
 453 . However , each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes , organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string .	0	biology
 The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage , in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair .	1	biology
 However , because of the process of recombination , or “ crossover , ” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently , or as if they are not linked .	0	biology
 456 . It is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes , known as synapsis , does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells .	1	biology
 When synapsed , homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination , or more simply , “ crossing over . ”	1	biology
 459 . Conversely , alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together .	0	biology
 The average number of crossovers between two alleles — that is , their recombination frequency — correlated with their genetic distance from each other , relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome .	1	biology
 Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above , the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05 .	0	biology
 462 . A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .	1	biology
 To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 465 . Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes , as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes .	0	biology
 They are caused by nondisjunction , which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis .	1	biology
 Misaligned or incomplete synapsis , or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration , can cause nondisjunction .	0	biology
 468 . An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets ( two for diploid species ) is called polyploid .	1	biology
 For instance , fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote .	0	biology
 471 . An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere , or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms , making these inversions easily identifiable .	0	biology
 474 . Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes .	1	biology
 Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose .	1	biology
 477 . Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .	0	biology
 Single - strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single - stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix .	0	biology
 DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) .	0	biology
 480 . One strand , which is complementary to the 3 ' to 5 ' parental DNA strand , is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction .	1	biology
 This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .	0	biology
 The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .	0	biology
 483 . The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3 ' to 5 ' , and that of the leading strand 5 ' to 3 ' .	0	biology
 A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides .	0	biology
 The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .	1	biology
 486 . Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In proofreading , the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one , so a correction can be made .	0	biology
 The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand .	0	biology
 489 . Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA .	0	biology
 Mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to DNA .	1	biology
 Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .	0	biology
 492 . Mutations may have a wide range of effects .	0	biology
 Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .	1	biology
 Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .	1	biology
 495 . Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .	1	biology
 Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .	1	biology
 Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base , known as an insertion , or the removal of a base , also known as deletion .	1	biology
 498 . The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma ( [ link ] ) , which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs , which in turn specify the sequence of proteins .	1	biology
 The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs .	0	biology
 501 . This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid .	1	biology
 These nucleotide triplets are called codons .	0	biology
 The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 504 . The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid .	1	biology
 In addition , prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids , which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes .	1	biology
 Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .	0	biology
 507 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .	1	biology
 Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 510 . coli , the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits , two of which are identical .	0	biology
 Four of these subunits , denoted α , α , β , and β ' comprise the polymerase core enzyme .	0	biology
 These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed , and they disassemble once transcription is complete .	0	biology
 513 . Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes , a few elements are conserved .	0	biology
 At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site , there are two promoter consensus sequences , or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The -10 consensus sequence , called the -10 region , is TATAAT .	1	biology
 516 . The mRNA folds back on itself , and the complementary C – G nucleotides bind together .	0	biology
 The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A – T nucleotides .	0	biology
 The complementary U – A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA .	0	biology
 519 . This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .	0	biology
 Further upstream of the TATA box , eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC - rich boxes ( GGCG ) or octamer boxes ( ATTTGCAT ) .	0	biology
 These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “ active ” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell .	0	biology
 522 . Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes , all synthesizing protein in the same direction : reading the mRNA from 5 ' to 3 ' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus .	0	biology
 The complete mRNA / poly - ribosome structure is called a polysome .	1	biology
 525 . When an in - frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation , a non - formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met - tRNAMet . In E. coli mRNA , a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon , called the Shine - Dalgarno sequence ( AGGAGG ) , interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome .	1	biology
 This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template .	0	biology
 528 . During and after translation , individual amino acids may be chemically modified , signal sequences may be appended , and the new protein “ folds ” into a distinct three - dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions .	0	biology
 A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment .	1	biology
 These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein ’s “ train ticket ” to its ultimate destination .	0	biology
 531 . Once elongation is complete , the pre - mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU - rich sequence , leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre - mRNA .	0	biology
 An enzyme called poly - A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues , called the poly - A tail .	1	biology
 This modification further protects the pre - mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm .	0	biology
 534 . Some of a ribosome ’s RNA molecules are purely structural , whereas others have catalytic or binding activities .	0	biology
 Mature tRNAs take on a three - dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The anticodon is a three - nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing .	1	biology
 537 . The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm .	0	biology
 Proteins that are needed for a specific function , or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway , are encoded together in blocks called operons .	1	biology
 For example , all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose ( or lac ) operon .	0	biology
 540 . coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes .	0	biology
 These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan ( trp ) operon ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If tryptophan is present in the environment , then E .	0	biology
 543 . When tryptophan is not present in the cell , the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator ; therefore , the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized .	0	biology
 Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off , the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators .	0	biology
 546 . The lac Operon : An Inducer OperonThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons , which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell .	1	biology
 The lac operon is a typical inducible operon .	0	biology
 549 . There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif .	0	biology
 When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .	1	biology
 The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .	1	biology
" 552 . Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it is given two protective "" caps "" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey ."	0	biology
 The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) . The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .	1	biology
 555 . Proteins , called RNA - binding proteins , or RBPs , can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein - coding region .	0	biology
 These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions , or UTRs .	1	biology
 They are not introns ( those have been removed in the nucleus ) .	0	biology
 558 . The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre - miRNAs .	0	biology
 These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .	0	biology
 Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .	0	biology
 561 . In translation , the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex .	1	biology
 The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 564 . GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	0	biology
 The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .	0	biology
 When bound , the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex , bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated .	0	biology
 567 . While these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in one cancer , changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals .	0	biology
 Therefore , changes in histone acetylation ( epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing ) , activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation , increased RNA stability , increased translational control , and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells .	1	biology
 Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell .	0	biology
 570 . Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired ( such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample ) .	0	biology
 Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .	1	biology
 Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .	0	biology
 573 . DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) .	1	biology
 The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand ( called cDNA ) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA .	0	biology
 576 . The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .	0	biology
 When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , the technique is called Southern blotting , and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , it is called northern blotting .	1	biology
 Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome , and northern blots are used to detect gene expression .	0	biology
 579 . Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .	1	biology
 An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) .	0	biology
 The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .	1	biology
 582 . They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .	0	biology
 Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins .	1	biology
 Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes .	0	biology
 585 . Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism ’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism ’s DNA to achieve desirable traits .	1	biology
 The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .	0	biology
 588 . The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting .	0	biology
 Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by introducing mutations in a gene , or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism .	1	biology
 591 . In nature , the disease - causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids , called the Ti plasmids ( tumor - inducing plasmids ) , that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants .	1	biology
 DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell ’s genome .	0	biology
 594 . The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .	0	biology
 A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome .	1	biology
 Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .	0	biology
 597 . The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis , a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment .	1	biology
 The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA .	0	biology
 600 . There are three methods used to create a physical map : cytogenetic mapping , radiation hybrid mapping , and sequence mapping .	0	biology
 Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .	0	biology
 4220 . Depersonalization / derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization , derealization , or both .	1	psychology
 Depersonalization is defined as feelings of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , one ’s whole self or from aspects of the self ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 302 ) .	0	psychology
 4223 . By far , the most well - known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder ( formerly called multiple personality disorder ) .	0	psychology
 People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or identities , each well - defined and distinct from one another .	1	psychology
 4226 . Delusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory evidence .	1	psychology
 Many of us hold beliefs that some would consider odd , but a delusion is easily identified because it is clearly absurd .	0	psychology
 4232 . Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .	1	psychology
 In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .	1	psychology
 4235 . Brain imaging studies reveal that people with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles , the cavities within the brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid ( Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 This finding is important because larger than normal ventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size , thus implying that schizophrenia is associated with a loss of brain tissue .	0	psychology
 4238 . Extremely stressful or traumatic events , such as combat , natural disasters , and terrorist attacks , place the people who experience them at an increased risk for developing psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .	0	psychology
 Throughout much of the 20th century , this disorder was called shell shock and combat neurosis because its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat .	0	psychology
 4241 . The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders , organized into 3 different clusters .	0	psychology
 Cluster A disorders include paranoid personality disorder , schizoid personality disorder , and schizotypal personality disorder .	1	psychology
 People with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric .	0	psychology
 4244 . The “ borderline ” in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort to describe patients who appeared anxious , but were prone to brief psychotic experiences — that is , patients who were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis ( Freeman , Stone , Martin , & Reinecke , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 Today , borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning .	0	psychology
 Borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships , self - image , and mood , as well as marked impulsivity ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 4247 . The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders .	0	psychology
 Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in which depression is the main feature .	1	psychology
 Depression is a vague term that , in everyday language , refers to an intense and persistent sadness .	1	psychology
 4250 . According to the DSM-5 , the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include “ depressed mood most of the day , nearly every day ” ( feeling sad , empty , hopeless , or appearing tearful to others ) , and loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day , people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying , such as hobbies , sports , sex , social events , time spent with family , and so on .	0	psychology
 4253 . Another subtype , peripartum onset ( commonly referred to as postpartum depression ) , applies to women who experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks .	0	psychology
 4256 . To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in his life ; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder , they are not required for a diagnosis ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 According to the DSM-5 , a manic episode is characterized as a “ distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated , expansive , or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week , ” that lasts most of the time each day ( APA , 2013 , p. 124 ) .	1	psychology
 During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .	0	psychology
 4262 . Overwhelmed by hopelessness , devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness , and burdened with the inability to adequately cope with such feelings , they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out .	0	psychology
 Suicide , defined by the CDC as “ death caused by self - directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of the behavior ” ( CDC , 2013a ) , in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same time Crosby , Ortega , & Melanson , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 Not only must the person be biologically or psychologically vulnerable , but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act , and he must lack the necessary protective factors ( e.g. , social support from friends and family , religion , coping skills , and problem - solving skills ) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain ( Berman , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 4268 . An individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in her physical appearance that is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 These perceived physical defects cause the person to think she is unattractive , ugly , hideous , or deformed .	0	psychology
 4271 . The symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses , acquired and sustained as the result of a combination of two forms of learning : classical conditioning and operant conditioning ( Mowrer , 1960 ; Steinmetz , Tracy , & Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 Specifically , the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning , whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress .	0	psychology
 4277 . Social anxiety disorder ( formerly called social phobia ) is characterized by extreme and persistent fear or anxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively by others ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 As with specific phobias , social anxiety disorder is common in the United States ; a little over 12 % of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime ( Kessler et al . , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4286 . Groups of people would suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon .	0	psychology
 This compulsion to dance — referred to as dancing mania — sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Historical accounts indicate that those afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks , screaming of terrible visions and begging priests and monks to save their souls ( Waller , 2009b ) .	0	psychology
 4289 . A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .	1	psychology
 Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .	1	psychology
 4292 . Violating cultural expectations is not , in and of itself , a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Since behavior varies from one culture to another , what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures .	0	psychology
 For example , returning a stranger ’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures .	0	psychology
 4295 . How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person ’s inner states and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder ?	0	psychology
 Arriving at a proper diagnosis — that is , appropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms — is absolutely crucial .	1	psychology
 This process enables professionals to use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the patient , colleagues and the public .	0	psychology
 4298 . A second classification system , the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , is also widely recognized .	0	psychology
 Published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War II and , like the DSM , has been revised several times .	0	psychology
 4301 . In this dimension , people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers , cold , nonconformists , impulsive , antisocial , and hostile , whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control — they are more altruistic , empathetic , cooperative , and conventional ( Eysenck , Eysenck & Barrett , 1985).While Cattell ’s 16 factors may be too broad , the Eysenck ’s two - factor system has been criticized for being too narrow .	0	psychology
 Another personality theory , called the Five Factor Model , effectively hits a middle ground , with its five factors referred to as the Big Five personality traits .	0	psychology
 It is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic trait dimensions ( Funder , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 4304 . One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration ( Rentfrow et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 Selective migration is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs .	1	psychology
 4307 . The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach ( pronounced “ ROAR - shock ” ) .	0	psychology
 It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a psychologist .	0	psychology
 607 . The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single - stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide ( dNTP ) , which is a monomer , or a single unit , of DNA .	0	biology
 The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTPs ) .	0	biology
 The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group ( –OH ) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 610 . This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes .	0	biology
 However , the desire to sequence larger genomes , such as that of a human , led to the development of double - barrel shotgun sequencing , more formally known as pairwise - end sequencing .	0	biology
 In pairwise - end sequencing , both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap .	1	biology
 613 . Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .	0	biology
 The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation .	1	biology
 Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology , such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets .	0	biology
 616 . Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction , not all mRNAs are translated into proteins .	0	biology
 The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics .	1	biology
 Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes .	0	biology
 622 . Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries .	0	biology
 Most of the common diseases , such as heart disease , are multi - factored or polygenic , which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes , and also involve environmental factors such as diet .	1	biology
 In April 2010 , scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual ( Stephen Quake , a scientist at Stanford University , who had his genome sequenced ) ; the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases .	0	biology
 628 . A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation .	1	biology
 Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “ fit ” of the population to its environment .	0	biology
 631 . Over time , evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species , but they have maintained the same overall layout .	1	biology
 Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures .	0	biology
 637 . A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile , viable offspring .	1	biology
 According to this definition , one species is distinguished from another when , in nature , it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring .	0	biology
 640 . Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories .	0	biology
" Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution ."	1	biology
" Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location ."	1	biology
 643 . Over time , the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species .	1	biology
 This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin ; thus , causing the species to radiate into several new ones .	0	biology
 Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms .	0	biology
 646 . Given enough time , the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together , mating would be less likely , but if mating occurred , offspring would be non - viable or infertile .	0	biology
 Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation , the ability to interbreed , of the two populations .	1	biology
 649 . Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year , often just annually .	0	biology
 Differences in breeding schedules , called temporal isolation , can act as a form of reproductive isolation .	1	biology
 For example , two species of frogs inhabit the same area , but one reproduces from January to March , whereas the other reproduces from March to May ( [ link]).These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation .	0	biology
 652 . Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells ( eggs and sperm ) prevent fertilization from taking place ; this is called a gametic barrier .	1	biology
 Similarly , in some cases closely related organisms try to mate , but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together .	0	biology
 655 . In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .	1	biology
 The theory also connects this change of a population over time , called microevolution , with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters , called macroevolution .	1	biology
 658 . Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way , meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele , while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool .	0	biology
 The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population .	1	biology
 661 . Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic .	1	biology
 The distribution of phenotypes among individuals , known as the population variation , is influenced by a number of factors , including the population ’s genetic structure and the environment ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures .	0	biology
 664 . When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .	0	biology
 This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding , the mating of closely related individuals , which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease .	1	biology
 For example , a disease that is caused by a rare , recessive allele might exist in a population , but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele .	0	biology
 667 . Another way a population ’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift ( [ link ] ) , which is simply the effect of chance .	0	biology
 By chance , some individuals will have more offspring than others — not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically - encoded trait , but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time ( when the receptive female walked by ) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ( when a fox was hunting ) .	1	biology
 670 . If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers , the result can be a changing population .	0	biology
 There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs .	0	biology
 One reason is simple mate choice ; for example , female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger , brighter tails .	0	biology
 673 . Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .	0	biology
 One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .	1	biology
 Species of warm - blooded animals , for example , tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth ’s poles , allowing them to better conserve heat .	0	biology
 676 . However , it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts , but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population .	1	biology
 This concept , called relative fitness , allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation , and thus , how the population might evolve .	0	biology
 679 . Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection , while the intermediate phenotypes are , on average , less fit .	1	biology
 Known as diversifying selection ( [ link ] ) , this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms .	0	biology
 Large , dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force , while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male ’s territory .	0	biology
 682 . The speculation is that large tails carry risk , and only the best males survive that risk : the bigger the tail , the more fit the male .	0	biology
 This idea is known as the handicap principle .	0	biology
 685 . In scientific terms , the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny .	1	biology
 A phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism , such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved , to which species it is most closely related , and so forth .	0	biology
 688 . In a rooted tree , the branching indicates evolutionary relationships ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .	1	biology
 A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 691 . When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .	1	biology
 It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor , it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other .	0	biology
 694 . For example , after the common beginning of all life , scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya .	1	biology
 Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .	1	biology
 After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 697 . Therefore , the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus .	0	biology
 The name at each level is also called a taxon .	1	biology
 In other words , dogs are in order Carnivora .	0	biology
 700 . How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees ?	0	biology
 After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted , scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics .	0	biology
 This system sorts organisms into clades : groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor .	1	biology
 703 . Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure .	0	biology
 Only some of the organisms in [ link ] have this trait , and to those that do , it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree . The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative .	1	biology
 The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used .	0	biology
 706 . More recently , a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered .	0	biology
 Small , virus - like particles called gene transfer agents ( GTAs ) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another .	1	biology
 GTAs have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes , sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes .	0	biology
 709 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .	1	biology
 The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .	1	biology
 712 . Others have proposed abandoning any tree - like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure , the so - called “ ring of life ” ( [ link ] ) ; a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes .	1	biology
 Lake , again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm , proposes a ring - like model in which species of all three domains — Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya — evolved from a single pool of gene - swapping prokaryotes .	1	biology
 715 . They therefore lack most of the components of cells , such as organelles , ribosomes , and the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 A virion consists of a nucleic acid core , an outer protein coating or capsid , and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell .	1	biology
 Viruses may also contain additional proteins , such as enzymes .	0	biology
 718 . Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 For these viruses , attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane , so they can complete their replication inside the cell .	0	biology
 721 . Group I viruses contain double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) as their genome .	0	biology
 Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .	0	biology
 724 . The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .	0	biology
 Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .	0	biology
 Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .	0	biology
 727 . Multiple , full - length RNA strands of negative polarity ( complimentary to the positive - stranded genomic RNA ) are formed from these intermediates , which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity , including both full - length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs .	0	biology
 Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity , meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA .	0	biology
 As with Group IV viruses , dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA .	0	biology
 730 . Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host .	0	biology
 Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive .	1	biology
 For most viruses , the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach .	0	biology
 733 . The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .	0	biology
 Many animal viruses , such as HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding , where virions leave the cell individually .	1	biology
 During the budding process , the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed .	0	biology
 736 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	1	biology
 If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 739 . For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .	1	biology
 When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .	1	biology
 An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ ( lambda ) virus , which also infects the E .	0	biology
 742 . As you will learn in the next module , animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases .	0	biology
 Some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease , where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection .	1	biology
 Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .	0	biology
 745 . Some animal - infecting viruses , including the hepatitis C virus discussed above , are known as oncogenic viruses : They have the ability to cause cancer .	1	biology
 These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth ( oncogenes ) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth .	1	biology
 748 . One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear .	1	biology
 Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells , a process known as cell necrosis .	1	biology
 751 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .	0	biology
 Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .	0	biology
 754 . Another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect .	0	biology
 Oncolytic viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells .	1	biology
 A genetically modified adenovirus known as H101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck cancers .	0	biology
 757 . Prions , so - called because they are proteinaceous , are infectious particles — smaller than viruses — that contain no nucleic acids ( neither DNA nor RNA ) .	1	biology
 Historically , the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible , but pioneering work by Nobel Prize - winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist .	0	biology
 760 . Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things .	0	biology
 Prokaryotes recycle nutrients — essential substances ( such as carbon and nitrogen)—and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems , some of which are natural and others man - made .	1	biology
 Prokaryotes have been on Earth since long before multicellular life appeared .	0	biology
 766 . Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .	1	biology
 Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .	0	biology
 769 . For example , a soda lake is both salty and alkaline , so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Other extremophiles , like radioresistant organisms , do not prefer an extreme environment ( in this case , one with high levels of radiation ) , but have adapted to survive in it ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 772 . This model , however , does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes , most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact .	0	biology
 A biofilm is a microbial community ( [ link ] ) held together in a gummy - textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms , together with some proteins and nucleic acids .	1	biology
 Biofilms grow attached to surfaces .	0	biology
 775 . Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan , composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross - linked by unusual peptides containing both L- and D - amino acids including D - glutamic acid and D - alanine .	1	biology
 Proteins normally have only L - amino acids ; as a consequence , many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D - amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development .	0	biology
 778 . Gram - positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram - negative organisms ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Up to 90 percent of the cell wall in Gram - positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan , and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids .	0	biology
 Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids .	0	biology
 781 . If a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome , it too may become pathogenic .	0	biology
 In transduction , bacteriophages , the viruses that infect bacteria , sometimes also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another .	1	biology
 Transduction results in a recombinant organism .	0	biology
 787 . The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air , but this nitrogen is not usable by plants , which are primary producers .	0	biology
 Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .	1	biology
 Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .	1	biology
 790 . Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas , Nitrobacter , and Nitrospira .	0	biology
 The bacteria performs the reverse process , the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O , NO , and N2 , a process called denitrification . Art Connection	1	biology
 793 . A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 An endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present , usually at low incidence , in a population .	1	biology
 799 . Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of MRSA targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities .	0	biology
 The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that , among MRSA - afflicted persons in healthcare facilities , the average age is 68 , whereas people with “ community - associated MRSA ” ( CA - MRSA ) have an average age of 23.2This scanning electron micrograph shows methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria , commonly known as MRSA .	0	biology

 805 . According to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity , biotechnology is “ any technological application that uses biological systems , living organisms , or derivatives thereof , to make or modify products or processes for specific use .	1	biology
" "" 1 The concept of “ specific use ” involves some sort of commercial application ."	0	biology
 811 . Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis , in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward , pinching off an intracellular membranous sac , or vesicle , called a food vacuole ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The vesicle containing the ingested particle , the phagosome , then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a phagolysosome , and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism .	0	biology
 Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis . The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle , the digestion of the particle using hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome , and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell .	0	biology
 814 . A second Excavata subgroup , the parabasalids , also exhibits semi - functional mitochondria .	0	biology
 In parabasalids , these structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct .	0	biology
 Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling .	0	biology
 820 . As a result , the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and incorporated into their cells during photosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere .	1	biology
 In general , this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump , because carbon is “ pumped ” to the ocean depths where it is inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 The biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels .	0	biology
 826 . The vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus .	0	biology
 Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions .	0	biology
 829 . The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread - like structures called hyphae ( singular , hypha ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous .	1	biology
 The mass of hyphae is a mycelium ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 It can grow on a surface , in soil or decaying material , in a liquid , or even on living tissue .	0	biology
 835 . Fungi are mostly saprobes ( saprophyte is an equivalent term ) : organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter .	1	biology
 They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter : mainly plant material .	0	biology
 838 . During sexual reproduction , two mating types are produced .	0	biology
 When both mating types are present in the same mycelium , it is called homothallic , or self - fertile .	1	biology
 Heterothallic mycelia require two different , but compatible , mycelia to reproduce sexually .	1	biology
 841 . First , during plasmogamy ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , two haploid cells fuse , leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell .	1	biology
 During karyogamy ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus .	1	biology
 Finally , meiosis takes place in the gametangia ( singular , gametangium ) organs , in which gametes of different mating types are generated .	1	biology
 844 . Two opposing mating strains ( type + and type – ) must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse , leading to karyogamy .	0	biology
 The developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from desiccation and other hazards .	0	biology
 They may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable .	0	biology
 847 . The fungi in the Phylum Basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club - shaped fruiting bodies called basidia ( singular , basidium ) , which are the swollen terminal cell of a hypha .	0	biology
 The basidia , which are the reproductive organs of these fungi , are often contained within the familiar mushroom , commonly seen in fields after rain , on the supermarket shelves , and growing on your lawn ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 853 . Parasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other .	1	biology
 Both parasites and pathogens harm the host ; however , the pathogen causes a disease , whereas the parasite usually does not .	0	biology
 856 . Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues .	0	biology
 Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans ( and other animals ) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins ( mycotoxins ) .	1	biology
 Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms .	1	biology
 859 . There are a number of types of mycorrhizae .	0	biology
 Ectomycorrhizae ( “ outside ” mycorrhiza ) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath ( called a mantle ) and a Hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .	0	biology
 862 . Both the fungus and the alga participate in the formation of dispersal units for reproduction .	0	biology
 Lichens produce soredia , clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia .	0	biology
 Soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens .	0	biology
 865 . The term “ sporangia ” literally means “ spore in a vessel , ” as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores [ link ] .	1	biology
 Inside the multicellular sporangia , the diploid sporocytes , or mother cells , produce haploid spores by meiosis , where the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n ( note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid : for example , durum wheat is tetraploid , bread wheat is hexaploid , and some ferns are 1000-ploid ) .	1	biology
 The spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment .	0	biology
 868 . In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .	1	biology
 The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .	0	biology

 886 . The simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem .	0	biology
 Xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long - distance transport of water and nutrients , as well as the transfer of water - soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs .	1	biology
 The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .	1	biology
 889 . The existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants .	0	biology
 The first type of leaf is the microphyll , or “ little leaf , ” which can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian .	0	biology
 A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system .	1	biology
 892 . In addition to photosynthesis , leaves play another role in the life of the plants .	0	biology
 Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia .	1	biology

 6109 . Another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity , acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards .	0	government
 Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .	0	government
 In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .	0	government
 However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .	0	government
 6112 . Furthermore , the courts have ruled that , although public school officials are government actors , the First Amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited .	0	government
 In particular , in Tinker v. Des Moines ( 1969 ) and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier ( 1988 ) , the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates “ substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others”Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District , 393 U.S. 503 ( 1969 ) .	0	government

 For example , the content of school - sponsored activities like school newspapers and speeches delivered by students can be controlled , either for the purposes of instructing students in proper adult behavior or to deter conflict between students .	0	government
 6115 . Before the Civil War , this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction .	0	government
 In most states at that time , white males of military age were considered part of the militia , liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions , and the right “ to keep and bear Arms ” was considered a common - law right inherited from English law that predated the federal and state constitutions .	0	government
 The Constitution was not seen as a limitation on state power , and since the states expected all able - bodied free men to keep arms as a matter of course , what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves ( and their abolitionist allies ) did n’t have guns .	0	government
 6118 . However , in 2008 , in a narrow 5–4 decision on District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the Second Amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , at least in some circumstances — in particular , “ for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home.”District of Columbia et al .	0	government
 v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .	0	government
 Because the District of Columbia is not a state , this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments .	0	government
 6121 . The Fourth Amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes .	0	government
 We saw earlier that perhaps it reflects James Madison ’s broader concern about establishing an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home .	0	government
 6124 . What happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and find evidence of a crime ?	0	government
 In the 1961 Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio , the court decided that evidence obtained without a warrant that did n’t fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial , giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the exclusionary rule , which was first established in 1914 on a federal level in Weeks v. United States . Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 ( 1961 ) ; Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383 ( 1914 ) .	0	government
 The exclusionary rule does n’t just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant ( or falling under an exception noted above ) ; it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure .	0	government
 6127 . The Fifth Amendment also protects individuals against double jeopardy , a process that subjects a suspect to prosecution twice for the same criminal act .	0	government
 No one who has been acquitted ( found not guilty ) of a crime can be prosecuted again for that crime .	0	government
 6130 . Moreover , in a criminal trial , if someone does not testify in his or her own defense , the prosecution can not use that failure to testify as evidence of guilt or imply that an innocent person would testify .	0	government
 This provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the Supreme Court ’s 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona , whereby suspects were required to be informed of their most important rights , including the right against self - incrimination , before being interrogated in police custody . Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) .	1	government
 However , contrary to some media depictions of the Miranda warning , law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to inform suspects of their rights before they are questioned in situations where they are free to leave .	0	government
 6133 . And , while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well - off people whose rights do n’t necessarily need protecting since they can fend for themselves in the political system , frequently these cases pit lower- and middle - class homeowners against multinational corporations or multimillionaires with the ear of city and state officials .	0	government
 In a notorious 2005 case , Kelo v. City of New London , the Supreme Court sided with municipal officials taking homes in a middle - class neighborhood to obtain land for a large pharmaceutical company ’s corporate campus . Kelo et al .	1	government
 v. City of New London et al . , 545 U.S. 469 ( 2005 ) .	0	government
 The case led to a public backlash against the use of eminent domain and legal changes in many states , making it harder for cities to take property from one private party and give it to another for economic redevelopment purposes .	0	government
 6139 . Bail is a payment of money that allows a person accused of a crime to be freed pending trial ; if you “ make bail ” in a case and do not show up for your trial , you will forfeit the money you paid .	1	government
 Since many people can not afford to pay bail directly , they may instead get a bail bond , which allows them to pay a fraction of the money ( typically 10 percent ) to a person who sells bonds and who pays the full bail amount .	1	government
 ( In most states , the bond seller makes money because the defendant does not get back the money for the bond , and most people show up for their trials . )	0	government
 6142 . As this chapter has suggested , the provisions of the Bill of Rights have been interpreted and reinterpreted repeatedly over the past two centuries .	0	government
 However , the first eight amendments are largely silent on the status of traditional common law , which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights claimed by the framers in the Declaration of Independence .	0	government
 6145 . Unlike the other provisions of the Bill of Rights , this amendment focuses on power rather than rights .	0	government
 The courts have generally read the Tenth Amendment as merely stating , as Chief Justice Harlan Stone put it , a “ truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.”United States v. Darby Lumber , 312 U.S. 100 ( 1941 ) .	0	government
 In other words , rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any meaningful way , it simply restates what is made obvious elsewhere in the Constitution : the federal government has both enumerated and implied powers , but where the federal government does not ( or chooses not to ) exercise power , the states may do so .	0	government
 6148 . The legal landscape changed dramatically as a result of the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade , Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .	0	government
 in which the Supreme Court decided the right to privacy encompassed a right for women to terminate a pregnancy , at least under certain scenarios .	1	government
 The justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the “ potentiality of human life , ” nonetheless this had to be balanced against the interests of both women ’s health and women ’s right to decide whether to have an abortion .	0	government
 6151 . In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .	0	government
 Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .	0	government
 6154 . We can contrast civil rights with civil liberties , which are limitations on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms .	1	government
 For example , the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of “ cruel and unusual punishments ” to those convicted of crimes , a limitation on government power .	0	government
 6157 . Discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny .	0	government
 The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) and again in Clark v. Jeter ( 1988).Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .	0	government
 It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .	0	government
 In practice , this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld , although usually they are not .	0	government
 6160 . The Republican majority in Congress was enraged by the actions of the reconstituted governments of the southern states .	0	government
 In these states , many former Confederate politicians and their sympathizers returned to power and attempted to circumvent the Thirteenth Amendment ’s freeing of slaves by passing laws known as the black codes .	0	government
 These laws were designed to reduce former slaves to the status of serfs or indentured servants ; blacks were not just denied the right to vote but also could be arrested and jailed for vagrancy or idleness if they lacked jobs .	1	government

 6169 . At the end of the Civil War , the South entered a period called Reconstruction ( 1865–1877 ) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union .	1	government
 As part of this process , the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery .	0	government
 6172 . The Fifteenth Amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “ race , color , or previous condition of servitude . ” This construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications were ostensibly race - neutral .	1	government
 Thus , while states could not deny African American men the right to vote on the basis of race , they could deny it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not prove they were literate .	0	government
 6178 . Similarly , state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods blacks and whites could live in .	0	government
 Collectively , these discriminatory laws came to be known as Jim Crow laws .	0	government
 The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson , consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment ’s equal protection clause , and allowed segregation to continue . Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 ( 1896 ) .	0	government

 Some of the moderately distant galaxies , and hence among the younger , are known as quasars and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across .	1	physics
 Quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year , so that the energy - emitting region must be less than a light year across .	0	physics

 4362 . Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied .	0	economic
 Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 4365 . The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	1	economic
 4368 . Then , those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand : Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Therefore , the elasticity of demand from G to H 1.47 .	0	economic
 The magnitude of the elasticity has increased ( in absolute value ) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B .	0	economic
 Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .	0	economic
 4371 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .	1	economic
 In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 While perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic , goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves .	0	economic
 4374 . However , in some cases , the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise .	0	economic
 For example , many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil .	0	economic
 Coffee shops use coffee as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price of coffee .	0	economic
 4377 . However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .	0	economic
 When the income elasticity of demand is negative , the good is called an inferior good . The concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in Demand and Supply .	1	economic
 A higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good , which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive .	1	economic

 In this case , the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease , as shown in the last row of [ link].This pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production .	0	economic
 As another example , consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer ’s field .	0	economic
 4395 . Marginal cost is somewhat different .	0	economic
 Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output .	1	economic
 So it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced , but only the next one ( or next few ) .	0	economic
 4401 . This pattern was illustrated earlier in [ link].In the middle portion of the long - run average cost curve , the flat portion of the curve around Q3 , economies of scale have been exhausted .	0	economic
 In this situation , allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production , and it is called constant returns to scale .	0	economic
 In this range of the LRAC curve , the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls .	0	economic
 4407 . When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up , for example , people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands , commuting by carpool or mass transit , or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home .	0	economic
 Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand .	1	economic
 The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .	0	economic
 4410 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .	1	economic
 Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic

When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .	0	economic
 Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied — that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied — the law of supply .	1	economic
 The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .	0	economic
 4416 . Remember this : When two lines on a diagram cross , this intersection usually means something .	0	economic
 The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .	1	economic
 The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) .	1	economic
 4419 . In fact , at any above - equilibrium price , the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 We call this an excess supply or a surplus .	0	economic
 4422 . A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables : quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis .	0	economic
 The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .	0	economic
 4425 . They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home , and so on .	0	economic
 A product whose demand falls when income rises , and vice versa , is called an inferior good .	1	economic
 In other words , when income increases , the demand curve shifts to the left .	0	economic
 4428 . Other goods are complements for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other .	1	economic
 Examples include breakfast cereal and milk ; notebooks and pens or pencils , golf balls and golf clubs ; gasoline and sport utility vehicles ; and the five - way combination of bacon , lettuce , tomato , mayonnaise , and bread .	0	economic
 4431 . In thinking about the factors that affect supply , remember what motivates firms : profits , which are the difference between revenues and costs .	1	economic
 Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor , materials , and machinery , or what we call inputs or factors of production .	1	economic
 If a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged , a firm ’s profits go up .	0	economic
 4434 . How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events ?	0	economic
 The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption .	0	economic
 Look at how each economic event affects each market , one event at a time , holding all else constant .	1	economic
 4437 . Price controls come in two flavors .	0	economic
 A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level ( the “ ceiling ” ) , while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level ( the “ floor ” ) .	1	economic
 This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings .	0	economic
 4440 . If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington are higher than in other cities , more nurses will move to Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington to find jobs , more people will be willing to train as nurses , and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full - time job .	0	economic
 In other words , there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area . At equilibrium , the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal .	1	economic
 Thus , every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker , and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job .	0	economic
 4443 . The labor market , however , presents some prominent examples of price floors , which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low - paid workers .	0	economic
 The U.S. government sets a minimum wage , a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate .	1	economic
 In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 4449 . Many states do have usury laws , which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge .	1	economic
 However , in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate .	0	economic
 4452 . Information on the consumption choices of Americans is available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .	1	economic

 4455 . José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility , which is the term economists use to describe a person ’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices . Let ’s begin with an assumption , which will be discussed in more detail later , that José can measure his own utility with something called utils .	1	economic
 ( It is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals ; if one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils , this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much . )	0	economic
 4458 . Another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar .	0	economic
 Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility José receives given the price of the product .	1	economic
 For José ’s T - shirts and movies , the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4461 . Let ’s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly ’s choice between concert tickets at $ 50 each and getting away overnight to a bed - and - breakfast for $ 200 per night .	0	economic
 Kimberly has $ 1,000 per year to spend between these two choices .	0	economic
 4464 . A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .	0	economic
 Goods where demand declines as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ inferior goods . ” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises , because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer .	1	economic
 For example , a higher - income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car , and instead eat more steak and buy a new car .	0	economic
 4470 . Rates of saving in America have never been especially high , but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years , as the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in [ link ] show .	0	economic
 A decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint .	0	economic
 Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor - leisure decision .	0	economic
 4473 . This insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return .	0	economic
 For example , Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) and 401(k ) accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later , after retirement .	1	economic
 The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual , while a 401(k ) needs to be set up through an employer .	0	economic
 4476 . Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting , or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values .	1	economic
 Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible , or having equal value to the individual , regardless of the situation .	0	economic
 You might , for instance , think of the $ 25 you found in the street differently from the $ 25 you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant .	0	economic
 4479 . A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker , because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market .	1	economic
 If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny , it will lose all of its sales to competitors .	0	economic
 4482 . [ link ] presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [ link ] .	0	economic
 The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit .	1	economic
 As mentioned before , a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product — that is , the firm ’s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level .	0	economic
 4485 . But in the long run , firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output , and some firms will cease production altogether .	0	economic
 The long - run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit .	1	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from , and the reasons why some firms go out of business . Why do firms cease to exist ?	0	economic
 4488 . For a constant cost industry , whenever there is an increase in market demand and price , then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms’ entry and stops at the point where the new long - run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before .	1	economic
 But why will costs remain the same ?	0	economic
 4491 . When profit - maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility - maximizing consumers , something remarkable happens : the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency ( terms that were first introduced in ( Choice in a World of Scarcity ) .	0	economic
 Productive efficiency means producing without waste , so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 In the long run in a perfectly competitive market , because of the process of entry and exit , the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .	0	economic
 4494 . These profits should attract vigorous competition as described in Perfect Competition , and yet , because of one particular characteristic of monopoly , they do not .	0	economic
 Barriers to entry are the legal , technological , or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market .	1	economic
 Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable , such as the cost of renting retail space , to the extremely restrictive .	0	economic
 4497 . Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition .	0	economic
 ( This theme was introduced in Cost and Industry Structure ) .	0	economic
 4500 . A copyright , according to the U.S .	0	economic
 Copyright Office , “ is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States for ‘ original works of authorship’ including literary , dramatic , musical , architectural , cartographic , choreographic , pantomimic , pictorial , graphic , sculptural , and audiovisual creations . ” No one can reproduce , display , or perform a copyrighted work without permission of the author .	1	economic
 4503 . AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission , so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism .	0	economic
 The same thing happened to local service , especially in recent years , with the growth in cellular phone systems . The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation , starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s .	0	economic
 This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter , the prices that could be charged , and the quantities that could be produced in many industries , including telecommunications , airlines , trucking , banking , and electricity .	0	economic
 4506 . But a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs , because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience .	0	economic
 A monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit - maximizing combination of quantity and price .	1	economic
 4509 . Allocative efficiency is a social concept .	0	economic
 It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output , the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost .	1	economic
 4512 . One type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition .	0	economic
 Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms , but the products that they sell are not identical .	1	economic
 4515 . A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways : physical aspects of the product , location from which the product is sold , intangible aspects of the product , and perceptions of the product .	1	economic
 Products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products .	0	economic
 4518 . As an example of a profit - maximizing monopolistic competitor , consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store , which serves pizza with cheese , sweet and sour sauce , and your choice of vegetables and meats .	0	economic
 Although Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants , it has a differentiated product .	0	economic
 4521 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .	0	economic
 The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .	1	economic
 When price is equal to average cost , economic profits are zero .	0	economic
 4524 . Critics of market - oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles .	0	economic
 They argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation , and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation , is socially wasteful — that is , most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price .	0	economic
 Defenders of a market - oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names , no one is forcing them to do so .	0	economic
 4527 . Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve — which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms ( and they need not produce differentiated products ) .	0	economic
 Again , smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete , while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price .	0	economic
 4530 . In the United States , as well as many other countries , it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti - competitive behavior , which is a violation of antitrust law .	0	economic
 Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States .	0	economic
 4533 . The prisoner ’s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self - interest .	1	economic
 It applies well to oligopoly .	0	economic
 4536 . If a group of U.S. companies signed such a contract , however , it would be illegal .	0	economic
 Certain international organizations , like the nations that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly , hold down output , and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports .	0	economic
 Such agreements , however , because they fall in a gray area of international law , are not legally enforceable .	0	economic
 4539 . Thus , if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel , but do not match price increases , then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices , since the potential gains are minimal .	0	economic
 This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation , in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output , increase price , and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement .	0	economic
 4542 . The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers , and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones , are called antitrust laws .	1	economic
 Before a large merger happens , the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger , prohibit it , or allow it if certain conditions are met .	0	economic
 4545 . Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .	1	economic
 In 1950 , the Celler - Kefauver Act extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers .	0	economic
 In the twenty - first century , the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws .	0	economic
 4548 . Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index ( HHI ) .	0	economic
 The HHI , as it is often called , is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry , as the following Work it Out shows .	1	economic
 4551 . For more on the difficulties of defining markets , refer to Monopoly . This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies , instead of defining a market and counting up total sales .	0	economic
 A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real - world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger .	0	economic
 A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry .	0	economic
 4554 . An exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal .	0	economic
 It is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers .	0	economic
 4557 . Computer software manufacturers may often bundle together a number of different programs , even when the buyer wants only a few of the programs .	0	economic
 Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase , for example . Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm ( or firms ) reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low , until the new firm is driven out of the market , at which point the existing firm raises prices again .	0	economic
 This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market .	0	economic
 4560 . So what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly ?	0	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the case of natural monopoly , with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve .	0	economic
 Points A , B , C , and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation .	0	economic
 4563 . Thus , in the 1980s and 1990s , some regulators of public utilities began to use price cap regulation , where the regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years .	1	economic
 A common pattern was to require a price that declined slightly over time .	0	economic
 4566 . A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron , Tyco International , and WorldCom led to the Sarbanes - Oxley Act in 2002 .	0	economic

 4569 . In this case , the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange , but you have no voice in their market transaction .	0	economic
 The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .	1	economic
 Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	0	economic
 4572 . If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	0	economic
 If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .	0	economic
 4575 . Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .	0	economic
 If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .	0	economic
 4578 . In 1970 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) was created to oversee all environmental laws .	1	economic
 In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .	1	economic
 Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .	0	economic
 4581 . [ link ] illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution .	0	economic
 The marginal cost of pollution reduction , like most most marginal cost curves increases with output , at least in the short run .	0	economic

 Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned ?	0	economic
 4587 . [ link ] illustrates a theoretical model of this situation .	0	economic
 When the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive — for example , at quantity Qa — there are usually a lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution , and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high .	0	economic
 At Qa , it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution .	0	economic
 4590 . Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .	0	economic
 Global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities . Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities .	0	economic
 If nations such as China , India , Brazil , Mexico , and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats , then the world ’s high - income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases .	0	economic
 4593 . Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P , Q , R , S and T in [ link ] , all of which lie along the production possibility frontier .	0	economic
 Countries with low per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) , such as China , place a greater emphasis on economic output — which in turn helps to produce nutrition , shelter , health , education , and desirable consumer goods .	0	economic
 Countries with higher income levels , where a greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life , may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection .	0	economic
 4596 . Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want .	0	economic
 As Gregory Lee , CEO of Samsung said , “ Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology . ” An innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above - normal profits before competitors can catch up .	0	economic
 4599 . If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .	0	economic
 However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .	0	economic
 The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 4602 . The social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug .	1	economic
 If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies , its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial , and it would be willing to borrow and invest $ 52 million .	0	economic
 However , if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits , the firm will not spend as much on creating new products .	0	economic
 4605 . After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .	0	economic
 While not always easy to measure , according to Walter McMahon , the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population , lower levels of crime , a cleaner environment and a more stable , democratic government .	1	economic
 For these reasons , many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary , secondary , and higher education .	0	economic
 4608 . State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways .	0	economic
 For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ” The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical - related research spending $ 117 billion in 2011 .	1	economic
 Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .	0	economic
 4611 . What about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit ?	1	economic
 This kind of good is called a public good .	0	economic

 In addition , nothing prevented colonists from building their own fleet of ships to engage in trade .	0	history
 2186 . The Massachusetts Government Act had shut down the colonial government there , but resistance - minded colonists began meeting in extralegal assemblies .	0	history
 One of these assemblies , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress , passed the Suffolk Resolves in September 1774 , which laid out a plan of resistance to the Intolerable Acts .	1	history
 Meanwhile , the First Continental Congress was convening to discuss how to respond to the acts themselves .	0	history
 2189 . If the Commons had the balance of power , democracy or mob rule would prevail .	0	history
 The British Constitution promised representation of the will of British subjects , and without such representation , even the indirect tax of the Sugar Act was considered a threat to the settlers’ rights as British subjects .	0	history
 Furthermore , some American colonists felt the colonies were on equal political footing with Great Britain .	0	history
 2192 . In early 1774 , leaders in Parliament responded with a set of four measures designed to punish Massachusetts , commonly known at the Coercive Acts .	1	history
 The Boston Port Act shut down Boston Harbor until the East India Company was repaid .	1	history
 2198 . While these gentry were drafting their grievances during the Stamp Act Congress , other colonists showed their distaste for the new act by boycotting British goods and protesting in the streets .	0	history
 Two groups , the Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of Liberty , led the popular resistance to the Stamp Act .	1	history
 Both groups considered themselves British patriots defending their liberty , just as their forebears had done in the time of James II .	0	history
 2201 . In Massachusetts in 1768 , Samuel Adams wrote a letter that became known as the Massachusetts Circular .	0	history

 2204 . Gage ’s actions led to the formation of local rebel militias that were able to mobilize in a minute ’s time .	0	history
 These minutemen , many of whom were veterans of the French and Indian War , played an important role in the war for independence .	0	history
 In one instance , General Gage seized munitions in Cambridge and Charlestown , but when he arrived to do the same in Salem , his troops were met by a large crowd of minutemen and had to leave empty - handed .	0	history
 2207 . In Virginia , the royal governor , Lord Dunmore , raised Loyalist forces to combat the rebel colonists and also tried to use the large slave population to put down the rebellion .	0	history

 The ideas of the French philosopher Montesquieu , who had advocated the separation of powers in government , guided Adams ’s thinking .	0	history
 Responding to a request for advice on proper government from North Carolina , Adams wrote Thoughts on Government , which influenced many state legislatures .	0	history
 2228 . The number of representatives in the upper chamber would also be based on the state ’s population .	0	history
 This proportional representation gave the more populous states , like Virginia , more political power .	0	history
 The Virginia Plan also called for an executive branch and a judicial branch , both of which were absent under the Articles of Confederation .	1	history
 2231 . Under the three - fifths compromise in the 1787 Constitution , each slave would be counted as three - fifths of a person , so that three - fifths of the slave population would be counted toward the overall state population .	1	history
 Article 1 , Section 2 stipulated that “ Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several states .	0	history
 2234 . Supporters of the 1787 Constitution , known as Federalists , made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future .	1	history
 Those who opposed it , known as Anti - Federalists , argued that the Constitution would consolidate all power in a national government , robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions .	1	history
 To them , the Constitution appeared to mimic the old corrupt and centralized British regime , under which a far - off government made the laws .	0	history
 2237 . The United States operated with a flurry of different notes from multiple state banks and no coherent regulation .	0	history
 By proposing that the new national bank buy up large volumes of state bank notes and demanding their conversion into gold , Hamilton especially wanted to discipline those state banks that issued paper money irresponsibly .	0	history
 To that end , he delivered his “ Report on a National Bank ” in December 1790 , proposing a Bank of the United States , an institution modeled on the Bank of England .	1	history
 2240 . In 1793 , the revolutionary French government sent Edmond - Charles Genêt to the United States to negotiate an alliance with the U.S. government .	0	history

 News of the attempt to extract a bribe , known as the XYZ affair because the French emissaries were referred to as X , Y , and Z in letters that President Adams released to Congress , outraged the American public and turned public opinion decidedly against France ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 In the court of public opinion , Federalists appeared to have been correct in their interpretation of France , while the pro - French Democratic - Republicans had been misled .	0	history
 2249 . During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , artisans — skilled , experienced craft workers — produced goods by hand .	1	history
 The production of shoes provides a good example .	0	history
 2255 . The Land Law of 1800 further encouraged land sales in the Northwest Territory by reducing the minimum parcel size by half and enabling sales on credit , with the goal of stimulating settlement by ordinary farmers .	1	history
 The government created land offices to handle these sales and established them in the West within easy reach of prospective landowners .	0	history
 They could thus purchase land directly from the government , at the price the government had set .	0	history
 2258 . Whitney also worked on machine tools , devices that cut and shaped metal to make standardized , interchangeable parts for other mechanical devices like clocks and guns .	1	history
 Whitney ’s machine tools to manufacture parts for muskets enabled guns to be manufactured and repaired by people other than skilled gunsmiths .	0	history
 2261 . The railroads with steam locomotives offered a new mode of transportation that fascinated citizens , buoying their optimistic view of the possibilities of technological progress .	0	history

 John C. Calhoun labeled the whole affair a “ corrupt bargain ” ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Everywhere , Jackson supporters vowed revenge against the anti - majoritarian result of 1824 .	0	history
 2270 . Amid revelations of widespread fraud , including the disclosure that some $ 300,000 was missing from the Treasury Department , Jackson removed almost 50 percent of appointed civil officers , which allowed him to handpick their replacements .	0	history
 This replacement of appointed federal officials is called rotation in office .	1	history
 Lucrative posts , such as postmaster and deputy postmaster , went to party loyalists , especially in places where Jackson ’s support had been weakest , such as New England .	0	history
 2273 . Some southerners feared the federal government would next take additional action against the South , including the abolition of slavery .	0	history
 The theory of nullification , or the voiding of unwelcome federal laws , provided wealthy slaveholders , who were a minority in the United States , with an argument for resisting the national government if it acted contrary to their interests .	1	history
 James Hamilton , who served as governor of South Carolina in the early 1830s , denounced the “ despotic majority that oppresses us . ” Nullification also raised the specter of secession ; aggrieved states at the mercy of an aggressive majority would be forced to leave the Union .	1	history
 2276 . This message referred directly to the situation in Georgia , Mississippi , and Alabama , where the Creek , Choctaw , Chickasaw , Seminole , and Cherokee peoples stood as obstacles to white settlement .	1	history
 These groups were known as the Five Civilized Tribes , because they had largely adopted Anglo - American culture , speaking English and practicing Christianity .	0	history
 Some held slaves like their white counterparts .	0	history
 2279 . A great deal of the social revolution of democracy , however , carried negative consequences .	0	history
 Indeed , Tocqueville described a new type of tyranny , the tyranny of the majority , which overpowers the will of minorities and individuals and was , in his view , unleashed by democracy in the United States .	1	history
 2282 . For centuries Europeans had mistakenly believed an all - water route across the North American continent existed .	1	history
 This “ Northwest Passage ” would afford the country that controlled it not only access to the interior of North America but also — more importantly — a relatively quick route to the Pacific Ocean and to trade with Asia .	0	history
 The Spanish , French , and British searched for years before American explorers took up the challenge of finding it .	0	history
 2285 . Northern representatives supported the Tallmadge Amendment , denouncing slavery as immoral and opposed to the nation ’s founding principles of equality and liberty .	1	history
 Southerners in Congress rejected the amendment as an attempt to gradually abolish slavery — not just in Missouri but throughout the Union — by violating the property rights of slaveholders and their freedom to take their property wherever they wished .	0	history
 2288 . Texas was sparsely settled , and the few Mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile Indian tribes , especially the Comanche , who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle . To increase the non - Indian population in Texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of Mexico , Spain began to recruit empresarios .	0	history
 An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land .	1	history
 Moses Austin , a once - prosperous entrepreneur reduced to poverty by the Panic of 1819 , requested permission to settle three hundred English - speaking American residents in Texas .	0	history
 2291 . Accustomed to representative democracy , jury trials , and the defendant ’s right to appear before a judge , the Anglo - American settlers in Texas also disliked the Mexican legal system , which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde , an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor , judge , and law enforcement officer .	1	history
 The alcalde sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in Saltillo , the state capital , who decided the outcome .	0	history
 2294 . The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , signed in February 1848 , was a triumph for American expansionism under which Mexico ceded nearly half its land to the United States .	0	history
 The Mexican Cession , as the conquest of land west of the Rio Grande was called , included the current states of California , New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , Utah , and portions of Colorado and Wyoming .	1	history
 Mexico also recognized the Rio Grande as the border with the United States .	0	history
 2297 . Committed to protecting white workers by keeping slavery out of the lands taken from Mexico , Pennsylvania congressman David Wilmot attached to an 1846 revenue bill an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the new territory .	1	history
 The Wilmot Proviso was not entirely new .	0	history
 Other congressmen had drafted similar legislation , and Wilmot ’s language was largely copied from the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that had banned slavery in that territory .	0	history
 2300 . Disgusted by the result , the Barnburners united with antislavery Whigs and former members of the Liberty Party to form a new political party — the Free - Soil Party , which took as its slogan “ Free Soil , Free Speech , Free Labor , and Free Men . ” The party had one real goal — to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time , southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories .	0	history
 2303 . In the antebellum era — that is , in the years before the Civil War — American planters in the South continued to grow Chesapeake tobacco and Carolina rice as they had in the colonial era .	1	history
 Cotton , however , emerged as the antebellum South ’s major commercial crop , eclipsing tobacco , rice , and sugar in economic importance .	1	history
 2306 . Some slaveholders responded to this situation by freeing slaves ; far more decided to sell their excess bondsmen .	0	history
 Virginia and Maryland therefore took the lead in the domestic slave trade , the trading of slaves within the borders of the United States .	1	history
 2309 . Calhoun became a leading political theorist defending slavery and the rights of the South , which he saw as containing an increasingly embattled minority .	0	history
 He advanced the idea of a concurrent majority , a majority of a separate region ( that would otherwise be in the minority of the nation ) with the power to veto or disallow legislation put forward by a hostile majority .	1	history
 2315 . Missionaries and circuit riders ( ministers without a fixed congregation ) brought the message of the awakening across the United States , including into the lives of slaves .	1	history

 They not only built the town of Harmony but also produced surplus goods to sell to the outside world .	0	history
 2324 . Graham advocated baths and cleanliness in general to preserve health ; hydropathy , or water cures for various ailments , became popular in the United States in the 1840s and 1850s .	1	history
 He also viewed masturbation and excessive sex as a cause of disease and debility .	0	history
 2327 . William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts distinguished himself as the leader of the abolitionist movement .	0	history
 Although he had once been in favor of colonization , he came to believe that such a scheme only deepened racism and perpetuated the sinful practices of his fellow Americans .	0	history
 2330 . In 1848 , about three hundred male and female feminists , many of them veterans of the abolition campaign , gathered at the Seneca Falls Convention in New York for a conference on women ’s rights that was organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton .	0	history
 It was the first of what became annual meetings that have continued to the present day .	0	history
 2333 . Most stayed in the South , hiding in plain sight among free blacks in urban areas .	0	history
 Nonetheless , southerners feared the influence of a vast Underground Railroad : the network of northern whites and free blacks who sympathized with runaway slaves and provided safe houses and safe passage from the South .	1	history
 Quakers , who had long been troubled by slavery , were especially active in this network .	0	history
 2339 . In 1857 , several months after President Buchanan took the oath of office , the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford .	0	history
 Dred Scott ( [ link ] ) , born a slave in Virginia in 1795 , had been one of the thousands forced to relocate as a result of the massive internal slave trade and taken to Missouri , where slavery had been adopted as part of the Missouri Compromise .	0	history
 2342 . Southern leaders were divided on how to respond to Republican success .	0	history
 Southern extremists , known as “ Fire - Eaters , ” openly called for secession .	1	history
 Others , like Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis , put forward a more moderate approach by demanding constitutional protection of slavery .	0	history
 2345 . In this way , states could protect themselves , and slavery , from interference by what they perceived to be an overbearing central government .	0	history
 The constitution of the Confederate States of America ( CSA ) , or the Confederacy , drafted at a convention in Montgomery , Alabama , in February 1861 , closely followed the 1787 Constitution .	0	history
 The only real difference between the two documents centered on slavery .	0	history
 2348 . General George B. McClellan , the general in chief of the army , responsible for overall control of Union land forces , proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the Confederates .	0	history
 In direct command of the Army of the Potomac , the Union fighting force operating outside Washington , DC , McClellan believed , incorrectly , that Confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle .	0	history
 2351 . General Ulysses S. Grant ’s Army of the West , operating in Kentucky , Tennessee , and the Mississippi River Valley , had been more successful .	0	history
 In the western campaign , the goal of both the Union and the Confederacy was to gain control of the major rivers in the west , especially the Mississippi .	0	history
 2354 . The Republican emphasis on free labor , rather than slave labor , also influenced the 1862 Land Grant College Act , commonly known as the Morrill Act after its author , Vermont Republican senator Justin Smith Morrill .	0	history
 The measure provided for the creation of agricultural colleges , funded through federal grants , to teach the latest agricultural techniques .	1	history
 2357 . On January 1 , 1863 , Lincoln made good on his promise and signed the Emancipation Proclamation .	0	history
 It stated “ That on the first day of January , in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty - three , all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State , the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States , shall be then , thenceforward , and forever free . ” The proclamation did not immediately free the slaves in the Confederate states .	1	history
 2360 . Many whites in the North found this deeply offensive , since they still believed in racial inequality .	0	history
 The 1863 New York City Draft Riots illustrated the depth of white anger .	0	history
 2363 . From the outset of the rebellion in 1861 , Lincoln ’s overriding goal had been to bring the Southern states quickly back into the fold in order to restore the Union ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 In early December 1863 , the president began the process of reunification by unveiling a three - part proposal known as the ten percent plan that outlined how the states would return .	0	history
 The ten percent plan gave a general pardon to all Southerners except high - ranking Confederate government and military leaders ; required 10 percent of the 1860 voting population in the former rebel states to take a binding oath of future allegiance to the United States and the emancipation of slaves ; and declared that once those voters took those oaths , the restored Confederate states would draft new state constitutions .	1	history
 2366 . It was important for them to show that the party supported all loyal men , regardless of their origin or political persuasion .	0	history
 Johnson appeared an ideal choice , because his nomination would bring with it the support of both pro - Southern elements and the War Democrats who rejected the conciliatory stance of the Copperheads , the northern Democrats who opposed the Civil War .	0	history
 2369 . In 1865 and 1866 , as Johnson announced the end of Reconstruction , southern states began to pass a series of discriminatory state laws collectively known as black codes .	1	history
 While the laws varied in both content and severity from state to state , the goal of the laws remained largely consistent .	0	history
 2372 . More dispiriting still was the fact that many women ’s rights activists , such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , had played a large part in the abolitionist movement leading up to the Civil War .	0	history
 Following the war , women and men , white and black , formed the American Equal Rights Association ( AERA ) for the expressed purpose of securing “ equal Rights to all American citizens , especially the right of suffrage , irrespective of race , color or sex . ” Two years later , with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , section 2 of which specifically qualified the liberties it extended to “ male citizens , ” it seemed as though the progress made in support of civil rights was not only passing women by but was purposely codifying their exclusion .	1	history
 As Congress debated the language of the Fifteenth Amendment , some held out hope that it would finally extend the franchise to women .	0	history
 2375 . Throughout the South , sharecropping took root , a crop - lien system that worked to the advantage of landowners .	1	history
 Under the system , freed people rented the land they worked , often on the same plantations where they had been slaves .	0	history
 2381 . In what became known as the Compromise of 1877 , Republican Senate leaders worked with the Democratic leadership so they would support Hayes and the commission ’s decision .	0	history
 The two sides agreed that one Southern Democrat would be appointed to Hayes ’s cabinet , Democrats would control federal patronage ( the awarding of government jobs ) in their areas in the South , and there would be a commitment to generous internal improvements , including federal aid for the Texas and Pacific Railway .	1	history
 2384 . In addition to a significant European migration westward , several thousand African Americans migrated west following the Civil War , as much to escape the racism and violence of the Old South as to find new economic opportunities .	1	history
 They were known as exodusters , referencing the biblical flight from Egypt , because they fled the racism of the South , with most of them headed to Kansas from Kentucky , Tennessee , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas .	0	history
 Over twenty - five thousand exodusters arrived in Kansas in 1879–1880 alone .	0	history
 2387 . The search for gold represented an opportunity far different from the slow plod that homesteading farmers faced .	0	history
 The discovery of gold at Sutter ’s Mill in Coloma , California , set a pattern for such strikes that was repeated again and again for the next decade , in what collectively became known as the California Gold Rush .	1	history
 In what became typical , a sudden disorderly rush of prospectors descended upon a new discovery site , followed by the arrival of those who hoped to benefit from the strike by preying off the newly rich .	0	history
 2390 . One of the more vicious examples was near Sand Creek , Colorado , where Colonel John Chivington led a militia raid upon a camp in which the leader had already negotiated a peaceful settlement .	1	history
 The camp was flying both the American flag and the white flag of surrender when Chivington ’s troops murdered close to one hundred people , the majority of them women and children , in what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre .	0	history
 For the rest of his life , Chivington would proudly display his collection of nearly one hundred Indian scalps from that day .	0	history
 2393 . In a few instances , frustrated Hispanic citizens fought back against the white settlers who dispossessed them of their belongings .	0	history
 In 1889–1890 in New Mexico , several hundred Mexican Americans formed las Gorras Blancas ( the White Caps ) to try and reclaim their land and intimidate white Americans , preventing further land seizures .	0	history
 White Caps conducted raids of white farms , burning homes , barns , and crops to express their growing anger and frustration .	0	history
 2396 . The exploitation of these new technologies provided opportunities for tremendous growth , and business entrepreneurs with financial backing and the right mix of business acumen and ambition could make their fortunes .	0	history
 Some of these new millionaires were known in their day as robber barons , a negative term that connoted the belief that they exploited workers and bent laws to succeed .	1	history
 Regardless of how they were perceived , these businessmen and the companies they created revolutionized American industry .	0	history
 2399 . He hounded those who refused to sell out to him , until they were driven out of business .	0	history
 Through his method of growth via mergers and acquisitions of similar companies — known as horizontal integration —Standard Oil grew to include almost all refineries in the area .	1	history
 By 1879 , the Standard Oil Company controlled nearly 95 percent of all oil refining businesses in the country , as well as 90 percent of all the refining businesses in the world .	0	history
 2405 . In one night , however , the KOL ’s popularity — and indeed the momentum of the labor movement as a whole — plummeted due to an event known as the Haymarket affair , which occurred on May 4 , 1886 , in Chicago ’s Haymarket Square ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 There , an anarchist group had gathered in response to a death at an earlier nationwide demonstration for the eight - hour workday .	1	history
 2408 . In the secular sphere , the settlement house movement of the 1890s provided additional relief .	0	history
 Pioneering women such as Jane Addams in Chicago and Lillian Wald in New York led this early progressive reform movement in the United States , building upon ideas originally fashioned by social reformers in England .	0	history
 2414 . Those middle - class and wealthier urbanites who enjoyed the costlier amenities presented by city life — including theaters , restaurants , and shopping — were free to escape to the suburbs , leaving behind the poorer working classes living in squalor and unsanitary conditions .	0	history
 Through the City Beautiful movement , leaders such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham sought to champion middle- and upper - class progressive reforms .	0	history
 They improved the quality of life for city dwellers , but also cultivated middle - class - dominated urban spaces in which Americans of different ethnicities , racial origins , and classes worked and lived .	0	history
 2418 . These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .	0	history
 Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models .	1	history
 Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James .	0	history
 2424 . Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control the president .	0	history
 The first was Roscoe Conkling , Republican senator from New York and leader of the Stalwarts , a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Long supporting former President Grant , Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes’ early appeals for civil service reform .	0	history
 2427 . Unable to find such a man , the predominant Half - Breeds again turned to their own leader , Senator Blaine .	0	history
 However , when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface , a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional Stalwarts - versus - Half - Breeds debate and form their own faction , the Mugwumps , a name taken from the Algonquin phrase for “ great chief . ”	0	history
 2430 . The Farmers’ Alliance , a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid-1880s , took root in the wake of the Grange movement .	1	history
 In 1890 , Dr. Charles Macune , who led the Southern Alliance , which was based in Texas and had over 100,000 members by 1886 , urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization , the Northwest Alliance , and the Colored Alliance , the largest African American organization in the United States .	1	history
 2433 . A notable example of the government ’s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’s Army .	0	history

 2436 . It was not until Theodore Roosevelt unexpectedly became president in 1901 that the federal government would engage in Progressive reforms .	0	history
 Before then , Progressivism was work done by the people , for the people .	0	history
 What knit Progressives together was the feeling that the country was moving at a dangerous pace in a dangerous direction and required the efforts of everyday Americans to help put it back on track .	0	history
 2439 . Another series of reforms pushed forward by Progressives that sought to sidestep the power of special interests in state legislatures and restore the democratic political process were three election innovations — the initiative , referendum , and recall .	0	history
 The first permitted voters to enact legislation by petitioning to place an idea , or initiative , on the ballot .	1	history
 2442 . The image below ( [ link ] ) shows a machinist in a factory where Taylor had consulted ; he is alone and focused solely on his job .	0	history
 Progressive in its emphasis on efficiency , the use of science , and the reliance on experts , Taylorism , as scientific management became known , was not widely popular among workers who resented managerial authority and the loss of autonomy over their work .	1	history
 Many workers went on strikes in response , although some favored Taylor ’s methods , since their pay was directly linked to the productivity increases that his methods achieved and since increased efficiency allowed companies to charge consumers lower prices .	0	history
 2445 . White middle - class reformers were appalled at the violence of race relations in the nation but typically shared the belief in racial characteristics and the superiority of Anglo - Saxon whites over African Americans , Asians , “ ethnic ” Europeans , Indians , and Latin American populations .	0	history
 Southern reformers considered segregation a Progressive solution to racial violence ; across the nation , educated middle - class Americans enthusiastically followed the work of eugenicists who identified virtually all human behavior as inheritable traits and issued awards at county fairs to families and individuals for their “ racial fitness . ” It was against this tide that African American leaders developed their own voice in the Progressive Era , working along diverse paths to improve the lives and conditions of African Americans throughout the country .	0	history
 2448 . By 1908 , internal fights over the role of women in the fight for African American equal rights lessened the interest in the Niagara Movement .	0	history
 But the movement laid the groundwork for the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , founded in 1909 .	0	history
 Du Bois served as the influential director of publications for the NAACP from its inception until 1933 .	0	history
 2451 . Although not as flamboyant or outwardly progressive as Roosevelt , Taft ’s organizational skills and generally solid performance as president aligned with the party leadership ’s concerns over another Roosevelt presidency and secured for him the Republican Party ’s nomination .	0	history
 Angry over this snub , in 1912 , Roosevelt and the other Progressive Republicans bolted from the Republican Party and formed the Progressive Party .	0	history
 His popularity had him hoping to win the presidential race as a third - party candidate .	0	history
 2454 . Fearing future loss of the territory through military conflict , as well as desiring to create challenges for Great Britain ( which they had fought in the Crimean War ) , Russia had happily accepted the American purchase offer .	0	history
 In the United States , several newspaper editors openly questioned the purchase and labeled it “ Seward ’s Folly ” ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 They highlighted the lack of Americans to populate the vast region and lamented the challenges in attempting to govern the native peoples in that territory .	0	history
 2457 . Shippers and other businessmen , particularly in the sugar industry , supported American intervention to safeguard their own interests in the region .	0	history
 Likewise , the “ Cuba Libre ” movement founded by José Martí , who quickly established offices in New York and Florida , further stirred American interest in the liberation cause .	0	history
 The difference in this uprising , however , was that supporters saw in the renewed U.S. Navy a force that could be a strong ally for Cuba .	0	history
 2460 . Domestically , the country was neither unified in their support of the treaty nor in the idea of the United States building an empire at all .	0	history
 Many prominent Americans , including Jane Addams , former President Grover Cleveland , Andrew Carnegie , Mark Twain , and Samuel Gompers , felt strongly that the country should not be pursuing an empire , and , in 1898 , they formed the Anti - Imperialist League to oppose this expansionism .	1	history
 The reasons for their opposition were varied : Some felt that empire building went against the principles of democracy and freedom upon which the country was founded , some worried about competition from foreign workers , and some held the xenophobic viewpoint that the assimilation of other races would hurt the country .	0	history
 2466 . Carranza refused to work with Wilson and the U.S. government , and instead threatened to defend Mexico ’s mineral rights against all American oil companies established there .	0	history
 Wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed Carranza , most notably Pancho Villa ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 However , Villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake Carranza ; in 1915 , Wilson reluctantly authorized official U.S. recognition of Carranza ’s government .	0	history
 2469 . The war effort was costly — with an eventual price tag in excess of $ 32 billion by 1920—and the government needed to finance it .	0	history
 The Liberty Loan Act allowed the federal government to sell liberty bonds to the American public , extolling citizens to “ do their part ” to help the war effort and bring the troops home .	1	history
 The government ultimately raised $ 23 billion through liberty bonds .	0	history
 2472 . First during World War I , then again in World War II , these women stepped up to run farms and other agricultural enterprises , as men left for the armed forces ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Known as Farmerettes , some twenty thousand women — mostly college educated and from larger urban areas — served in this capacity .	0	history
 Their reasons for joining were manifold .	0	history
 2475 . As early as January 1918—a full five months before U.S. military forces fired their first shot in the war , and eleven months before the actual armistice — Wilson announced his postwar peace plan before a joint session of Congress .	0	history
 Referring to what became known as the Fourteen Points , Wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade , specifically , free trade , freedom of the seas , an end to secret treaties and negotiations , promotion of self - determination of all nations , and more .	1	history
 In addition , he called for the creation of a League of Nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war .	0	history
 2478 . Meanwhile , southern lynchings continued to escalate , with white mobs burning African Americans at the stake .	0	history
 During the “ Red Summer ” of 1919 , northern cities recorded twenty - five bloody race riots that killed over 250 people .	1	history
 Among these was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 , where a white mob stoned a young black boy to death because he swam too close to the “ white beach ” on Lake Michigan .	1	history
 2481 . The 1920s opened up new possibilities of mobility for a large percentage of the U.S. population , as automobile manufacturers began to mass produce what had once been a luxury item , and daring aviators both demonstrated and drove advancements in aircraft technology .	0	history
 The most significant innovation of this era was Henry Ford ’s Model T Ford , which made car ownership available to the average American .	0	history
 2484 . Many of these new immigrants were coming from eastern and southern Europe and , for many English - speaking , native - born Americans of northern European descent , the growing diversity of new languages , customs , and religions triggered anxiety and racial animosity .	0	history
 In reaction , some embraced nativism , prizing white Americans with older family trees over more recent immigrants , and rejecting outside influences in favor of their own local customs .	1	history
 Nativists also stoked a sense of fear over the perceived foreign threat , pointing to the anarchist assassinations of the Spanish prime minister in 1897 , the Italian king in 1900 , and even President William McKinley in 1901 as proof .	0	history
 2487 . Many Americans were disillusioned in the post - World War I era , and their reactions took many forms .	0	history
 Rebellious American youth , in particular , adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents .	0	history
 Many young women of the era shed their mother ’s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper , the Jazz Age female stereotype , seeking the endless party .	1	history
 2490 . The law proved difficult to enforce , as illegal alcohol soon poured in from Canada and the Caribbean , and rural Americans resorted to home - brewed “ moonshine . ” The result was an eroding of respect for law and order , as many people continued to drink illegal liquor .	0	history
 Rather than bringing about an age of sobriety , as Progressive reformers had hoped , it gave rise to a new subculture that included illegal importers , interstate smuggling ( or bootlegging ) , clandestine saloons referred to as “ speakeasies , ” hipflasks , cocktail parties , and the organized crime of trafficking liquor .	1	history
 2493 . Although his critics depicted him as weak , lazy , or incompetent , he was actually quite shrewd and politically astute .	0	history
 Together with his running mate , Calvin Coolidge , the governor of Massachusetts , they attracted the votes of many Americans who sought Harding ’s promised return to normalcy .	0	history
 In the election , Harding defeated Governor James Cox of Ohio by the greatest majority in the history of two - party politics : 61 percent of the popular vote .	0	history
 2499 . Investors , along with the general public , withdrew their money from banks by the thousands , fearing the banks would go under .	0	history
 The more people pulled out their money in bank runs , the closer the banks came to insolvency ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2502 . In 1932 , a major strike at the Ford Motor Company factory near Detroit resulted in over sixty injuries and four deaths .	0	history
 Often referred to as the Ford Hunger March , the event unfolded as a planned demonstration among unemployed Ford workers who , to protest their desperate situation , marched nine miles from Detroit to the company ’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn .	1	history
 At the Dearborn city limits , local police launched tear gas at the roughly three thousand protestors , who responded by throwing stones and clods of dirt .	0	history
 2508 . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’s “ Good Neighbor ” policy .	0	history
 After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930—which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America .	1	history
 To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U.S. pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs .	1	history
 2511 . The election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signaled both immediate relief for the American public as well as a permanent shift in the role of the federal government in guiding the economy and providing direct assistance to the people , albeit through expensive programs that made extensive budget deficits commonplace .	0	history
 For many , the immediate relief was , at a minimum , psychological : Herbert Hoover was gone , and the situation could not grow worse under Roosevelt .	0	history
 2514 . After the landslide election , the country — and Hoover — had to endure the interregnum , the difficult four months between the election and President Roosevelt ’s inauguration in March 1933 .	1	history
 Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’s choosing .	0	history
 2520 . At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects .	0	history
 Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) .	0	history
 The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty - four who came from relief families .	1	history
 2523 . Regionally , Roosevelt ’s work was most famously seen in the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) ( [ link ] ) , a federal agency tasked with the job of planning and developing the area through flood control , reforestation , and hydroelectric power .	1	history
 Employing several thousand Americans on a project that Roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment , the TVA revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over - farmed , leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming .	0	history
 2526 . The Banking Act of 1935 was the most far - reaching revision of banking laws since the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 .	1	history
 Previously , regional reserve banks , particularly the New York Reserve Bank — controlled by the powerful Morgan and Rockefeller families — had dominated policy - making at the Federal Reserve .	0	history
 2529 . Roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation , doing so with the Wagner Act .	0	history
 The act created the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to once again protect American workers’ right to unionize and bargain collectively , as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard .	1	history
 Although roundly criticized by the Republican Party and factory owners , the Wagner Act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937 .	0	history
 2532 . Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .	0	history
 One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( [ link ] ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’s Division of Negro Affairs .	0	history
 Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’s foremost African American advisors .	0	history
 2535 . At a conference in Munich later that year , Great Britain ’s prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , and France ’s prime minister , Édouard Daladier , agreed to the partial dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland ( a region with a sizable German population ) by German troops ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 This Munich Pact offered a policy of appeasement , in the hope that German expansionist appetites could be satisfied without war .	0	history
 But not long after the agreement , Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia as well .	0	history
 2538 . Both groups ended their opposition , however , at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , respectively .	0	history
 Nevertheless , during the war , some seventy - two thousand men registered as conscientious objectors ( COs ) , and fifty - two thousand were granted that status .	0	history
 Of that fifty - two thousand , some accepted noncombat roles in the military , whereas others accepted unpaid work in civilian work camps .	0	history
 2541 . After all , they argued , if the United States were going to denounce Germany and Japan for abusing human rights , the country should itself be as exemplary as possible .	0	history
 Indeed , CORE ’s actions were in keeping with the goals of the Double V campaign that was begun in 1942 by the Pittsburgh Courier , the largest African American newspaper at the time ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 The campaign called upon African Americans to accomplish the two “ Vs ” : victory over America ’s foreign enemies and victory over racism in the United States .	1	history
 2544 . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .	0	history
 Executive Order 9066 , signed by Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , gave the army power to remove people from “ military areas ” to prevent sabotage or espionage .	1	history
 The army then used this authority to relocate people of Japanese ancestry living along the Pacific coast of Washington , Oregon , and California , as well as in parts of Arizona , to internment camps in the American interior .	0	history
 2547 . The “ Bataan Death March , ” during which as many as 650 American and 10,000 Filipino prisoners of war died , intensified anti - Japanese feelings .	1	history
 Kamikaze attacks that took place towards the end of the war were regarded as proof of the irrationality of Japanese martial values and mindless loyalty to Emperor Hirohito .	0	history
 2550 . To counter Soviet influence in the developing world , Kennedy supported a variety of measures .	0	history
 One of these was the Alliance for Progress , which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism .	1	history
 Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid , and he founded the Peace Corps , which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia , Africa , and Latin America .	1	history
 2553 . The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .	0	history
 One component of flexible response was the Green Berets , a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency — the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations .	1	history
 Much of the Kennedy administration ’s new approach to defense , however , remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare , and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal .	0	history
 2556 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , color , national origin , and religion , also prohibited , in Title VII , discrimination on the basis of sex .	1	history
 Ironically , protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a Virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act ’s passage ; his reasoning seemed to be that , while a white man might accept that African Americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination , the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate .	0	history
 2562 . For Carmichael , Black Power was the power of African Americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white - dominated ones , an idea also espoused in the 1920s by political leader and orator Marcus Garvey .	1	history
 Like Garvey , Carmichael became an advocate of black separatism , arguing that African Americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves .	1	history
 In keeping with this philosophy , Carmichael expelled SNCC ’s white members .	0	history
 2565 . Besides demobilizing the armed forces and preparing for the homecoming of servicemen and women , he also had to guide the nation through the process of returning to a peacetime economy .	0	history
 To this end , he proposed an ambitious program of social legislation that included establishing a federal minimum wage , expanding Social Security and public housing , and prohibiting child labor .	0	history
 Wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others , like meat .	0	history
 2568 . In February 1946 , George Kennan , a State Department official stationed at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , sent an eight - thousand - word message to Washington , DC .	0	history
 In what became known as the “ Long Telegram , ” Kennan maintained that Soviet leaders believed that the only way to protect the Soviet Union was to destroy “ rival ” nations and their influence over weaker nations .	1	history
 According to Kennan , the Soviet Union was not so much a revolutionary regime as a totalitarian bureaucracy that was unable to accept the prospect of a peaceful coexistence of the United States and itself .	0	history
 2571 . Like dominos toppling one another , entire regions would eventually be controlled by the Soviets .	0	history
 The demand for anti - Communist containment appeared as early as March 1946 in a speech by Winston Churchill , in which he referred to an Iron Curtain that divided Europe into the “ free ” West and the Communist East controlled by the Soviet Union .	0	history
 2574 . Witnesses were subpoenaed and required to testify before the committee ; refusal could result in imprisonment .	0	history
 Those who invoked Fifth Amendment protections , or were otherwise suspected of Communist sympathies , often lost their jobs or found themselves on a blacklist , which prevented them from securing employment .	0	history
 Notable artists who were blacklisted in the 1940s and 1950s include composer Leonard Bernstein , novelist Dashiell Hammett , playwright and screenwriter Lillian Hellman , actor and singer Paul Robeson , and musician Artie Shaw .	0	history
 2577 . His New Look strategy embraced nuclear “ massive retaliation , ” a plan for nuclear response to a first Soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond .	1	history
 Some labeled this approach “ Mutually Assured Destruction ” or MAD .	0	history
 2580 . The growing number of cars on the road changed consumption patterns , and drive - in and drive - through convenience stores , restaurants , and movie theaters began to dot the landscape .	0	history
 The first McDonalds opened in San Bernardino , California , in 1954 to cater to drivers in a hurry .	0	history
 2583 . Not all efforts to enact desegregation required the use of the courts , however .	0	history
 On April 15 , 1947 , Jackie Robinson started for the Brooklyn Dodgers , playing first base .	0	history
 He was the first African American to play baseball in the National League , breaking the color barrier .	0	history
 2586 . Many national politicians supported the segregationist efforts .	0	history
 In 1956 , ninety - six members of Congress signed “ The Southern Manifesto , ” in which they accused the U.S. Supreme Court of misusing its power and violating the principle of states’ rights , which maintained that states had rights equal to those of the federal government .	1	history
 2589 . “ Hippies ” rejected the conventions of traditional society .	1	history
 Men sported beards and grew their hair long ; both men and women wore clothing from non - Western cultures , defied their parents , rejected social etiquettes and manners , and turned to music as an expression of their sense of self .	0	history
 2592 . Nixon also courted northern , blue - collar workers , whom he later called the silent majority , to acknowledge their belief that their voices were seldom heard .	1	history
 These voters feared the social changes taking place in the country : Antiwar protests challenged their own sense of patriotism and civic duty , whereas the recreational use of new drugs threatened their cherished principles of self - discipline , and urban riots invoked the specter of a racial reckoning .	0	history
 2595 . The combination of unemployment and rising prices posed an unfamiliar challenge to economists whose fiscal policies of either expanding or contracting federal spending could only address one side of the problem at the cost of the other .	1	history
 This phenomenon of “ stagflation”—a term that combined the economic conditions of stagnation and inflation — outlived the Nixon administration , enduring into the early 1980s .	0	history
 2598 . As the conflict wore on and reports of brutalities increased , the antiwar movement grew in strength .	0	history
 To take the political pressure off himself and his administration , and find a way to exit Vietnam “ with honor , ” Nixon began the process of Vietnamization , turning more responsibility for the war over to South Vietnamese forces by training them and providing American weaponry , while withdrawing U.S. troops from the field .	1	history
 At the same time , however , Nixon authorized the bombing of neighboring Cambodia , which had declared its neutrality , in an effort to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong bases within that country and cut off supply routes between North and South Vietnam .	0	history
 2601 . In the weeks following the Watergate break - in , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , reporters for The Washington Post , received information from several anonymous sources , including one known to them only as “ Deep Throat , ” that led them to realize the White House was deeply implicated in the break - in .	0	history
 As the press focused on other events , Woodward and Bernstein continued to dig and publish their findings , keeping the public ’s attention on the unfolding scandal .	0	history
 2604 . After two unsuccessful Republican primary bids in 1968 and 1976 , Reagan won the presidency in 1980 .	0	history
 His victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and the growth of the New Right .	0	history
 This group of conservative Americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s .	1	history
 2607 . Much of the intellectual meat of the Reagan Revolution came from conservative think tanks ( policy or advocacy groups ) that specifically sought to shape American political and social dialogues .	0	history
 The Heritage Foundation , one such group , soon became the intellectual arm of the conservative movement .	1	history
 2610 . Because the disease was seen almost exclusively in male homosexuals , it was quickly dubbed “ gay cancer . ” Doctors soon realized it often coincided with other symptoms , including a rare form of pneumonia , and they renamed it “ Gay Related Immune Deficiency ” ( GRID ) , although people other than gay men , primarily intravenous drug users , were dying from the disease as well .	0	history
 The connection between gay men and GRID — later renamed human immunodeficiency virus / autoimmune deficiency syndrome , or HIV / AIDS — led heterosexuals largely to ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community , wrongly assuming they were safe from its effects .	0	history
 The federal government also overlooked the disease , and calls for more money to research and find the cure were ignored .	0	history
 2613 . Reagan , however , overlooked the legitimate complaints of the Sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to Cuban and Soviet influence .	0	history
 A year into his presidency , convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of Soviet and Communist influence in Latin America , he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to equip and train a group of anti - Sandinista Nicaraguans known as the Contras ( contrarevolucionários or “ counter - revolutionaries ” ) to oust Ortega .	1	history
 2616 . Soon they were mounting fierce opposition to the bill .	0	history
 Moderate conservatives dubbed the reform proposals “ Hillarycare ” and argued that the bill was an unwarranted expansion of the powers of the federal government that would interfere with people ’s ability to choose the healthcare provider they wanted .	0	history
 Those further to the right argued that healthcare reform was part of a larger and nefarious plot to control the public .	0	history
 2619 . Lieberman had been quick to denounce Clinton ’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky .	0	history
 Consumer advocate Ralph Nader ran as the candidate of the Green Party , a party devoted to environmental issues and grassroots activism , and Democrats feared that he would attract votes that Gore might otherwise win .	1	history
 2622 . On September 20 , in an address to a joint session of Congress , Bush declared war on terrorism , blamed al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the attacks , and demanded that the radical Islamic fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan , the Taliban , turn bin Laden over or face attack by the United States .	1	history
 This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .	1	history
 2625 . Fearing that terrorists might strike within the nation ’s borders again , and aware of the chronic lack of cooperation among different federal law enforcement agencies , Bush created the Office of Homeland Security in October 2001 .	0	history
 The next year , Congress passed the Homeland Security Act , creating the Department of Homeland Security , which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home ( [ link ] ) . The Bush administration also pushed the USA Patriot Act through Congress , which enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor citizens’ e - mails and phone conversations without a warrant .	1	history
 2628 . In the end , no such weapons were ever found .	0	history
 These criticisms were amplified by growing international concern over the treatment of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and widespread disgust over the torture conducted by U.S. troops at the prison in Abu Ghraib , Iraq , which surfaced only months before the election ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2631 . Even though CDOs consisted of subprime mortgages , credit card debt , and other risky investments , credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe .	0	history
 Making matters worse , financial institutions created instruments called credit default swaps , which were essentially a form of insurance on investments .	1	history
 If the investment lost money , the investors would be compensated .	0	history
 2634 . This popular denial has had huge global consequences .	0	history
 In 1998 , the United States , which produces roughly 36 percent of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that prevent the earth ’s heat from escaping into space , signed the Kyoto Protocol , an agreement among the world ’s nations to reduce their emissions of these gases .	1	history
 President Bush objected to the requirement that major industrialized nations limit their emissions to a greater extent than other parts of the world and argued that doing so might hurt the American economy .	0	history
 3917 . To help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - enhancing strategies .	0	psychology
 One strategy is rehearsal , or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered ( Craik & Watkins , 1973 ) .	1	psychology
 Think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child .	0	psychology
 3920 . Mnemonic devices are memory aids that help us organize information for encoding ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 They are especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps , stages , phases , and parts of a system ( Bellezza , 1981 ) .	0	psychology
 3923 . Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain , the senses , motor skills , and health and wellness .	1	psychology
 Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .	1	psychology
 Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .	1	psychology
 3926 . This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .	0	psychology
 Although children develop at slightly different rates , we can use these age - related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same - age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones ( e.g. , crawling , walking , writing , dressing , naming colors , speaking in sentences , and starting puberty ) .	0	psychology
 3932 . These findings suggest the heritability of some personality traits .	0	psychology
 Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to genetics .	1	psychology
 Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include leadership , obedience to authority , a sense of well - being , alienation , resistance to stress , and fearfulness .	0	psychology
 3935 . Freud viewed development as discontinuous ; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood , and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage , we may become stuck , or fixated , in that stage .	0	psychology
 Freud ’s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development .	0	psychology
 According to Freud , children ’s pleasure - seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone , at each of the five stages of development : oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital . While most of Freud ’s ideas have not found support in modern research , we can not discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology .	1	psychology
 3941 . First , they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata : assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know .	1	psychology
 Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information .	1	psychology
 This process continues as children interact with their environment .	0	psychology
 3944 . Piaget ’s second stage is the preoperational stage , which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old .	1	psychology
 In this stage , children can use symbols to represent words , images , and ideas , which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play .	0	psychology
 3947 . Piaget ’s third stage is the concrete operational stage , which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old .	1	psychology
 In this stage , children can think logically about real ( concrete ) events ; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies .	0	psychology
 3950 . A major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong .	0	psychology
 Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927–1987 ) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding cognitive development .	0	psychology
 Kohlberg believed that moral development , like cognitive development , follows a series of stages .	0	psychology
 3953 . The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels .	0	psychology
 Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .	1	psychology
 Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .	1	psychology
 3956 . Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .	1	psychology
 In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .	1	psychology
 An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .	1	psychology
 3962 . When you do well at a task , for example acing an exam , it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior ( “ I ’m smart , ” ) instead of a situational one ( “ The exam was easy , ” ) .	0	psychology
 The tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self - serving bias ( Miller & Ross , 1975 ) .	1	psychology
 This bias serves to protect self - esteem .	0	psychology
 3968 . During the first week after conception , the zygote divides and multiplies , going from a one - cell structure to two cells , then four cells , then eight cells , and so on .	1	psychology
 This process of cell division is called mitosis .	0	psychology
 Mitosis is a fragile process , and fewer than one - half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks ( Hall , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 3971 . The developing fetus is completely dependent on the mother for life .	0	psychology
 It is important that the mother takes good care of herself and receives prenatal care , which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother and the fetus ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 According to the National Institutes of Health ( [ NIH ] , 2013 ) , routine prenatal care is important because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy .	0	psychology
 3974 . Although small , a newborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth .	0	psychology
 All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes : inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation .	1	psychology
 Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors — these reflexes are crucial to survival .	0	psychology
 3977 . Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .	1	psychology
 3980 . A fourth style , known as disorganized attachment , was later described ( Main & Solomon , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 The most common type of attachment — also considered the healthiest — is called secure attachment ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In this type of attachment , the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger .	0	psychology
 3986 . For parents who employ the permissive style of parenting , the kids run the show and anything goes .	0	psychology
 Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment .	0	psychology
 3989 . In pre - industrial society , children were considered adults when they reached physical maturity , but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood called adolescence .	0	psychology
 Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emerging adulthood , which is discussed later .	1	psychology
 In the United States , adolescence is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while remaining connected to them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3992 . Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .	1	psychology
 Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .	1	psychology
 3998 . One major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles .	0	psychology
 A social role is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group ( Hare , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Each one of us has several social roles .	0	psychology
 4001 . Because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar settings .	0	psychology
 A script is a person ’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( Schank & Abelson , 1977 ) .	1	psychology
 How do you act on the first day of school , when you walk into an elevator , or are at a restaurant ?	0	psychology
 4004 . Visit this website to hear an NPR interview with Philip Zimbardo where he discusses the parallels between the Stanford prison experiment and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .	0	psychology
 4007 . When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable .	0	psychology
 We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious .	0	psychology
 This can be done in different ways , such as :	0	psychology
 4010 . In the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our attitudes , behaviors , and/or cognitions to make them consonant .	0	psychology
 Persuasion is the process of changing our attitude toward something based on some kind of communication .	1	psychology
 Much of the persuasion we experience comes from outside forces .	0	psychology
 4016 . One effective strategy is the foot - in - the - door technique ( Cialdini , 2001 ; Pliner , Hart , Kohl , & Saari , 1974 ) .	0	psychology
 Using the foot - in - the - door technique , the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item , only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item .	1	psychology
 The foot - in - the - door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser ( 1966 ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4019 . Asch ( 1955 ) found that 76 % of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line .	0	psychology
 Conformity is the change in a person ’s behavior to go along with the group , even if he does not agree with the group .	1	psychology
 Why would people give the wrong answer ?	0	psychology
 4025 . Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann , a Nazi war criminal .	1	psychology
 Eichmann ’s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was “ just following orders . ” Milgram ( 1963 ) wanted to test the validity of this defense , so he designed an experiment and initially recruited 40 men for his experiment .	0	psychology
 4028 . Another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization .	0	psychology
 Group polarization ( Teger & Pruitt , 1967 ) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group .	1	psychology
 That is , if a group initially favors a viewpoint , after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger endorsement of the viewpoint .	0	psychology
 4031 . It impacts their lives and their family ’s lives in positive and negative physical and psychological ways .	0	psychology
 Industrial and organizational ( I - O ) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work .	1	psychology
 4034 . As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships , organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment , including sexual harassment , and workplace violence .	0	psychology
 Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to optimize workers’ productivity , safety , and health .	1	psychology
 These studies can involve interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk , chair , and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at the desk using the computer for several hours each day .	0	psychology
 4037 . Analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the Hawthorne effect , which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are noticed , watched , and paid attention to by researchers or supervisors [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable , such as lighting levels , led to an improvement in productivity ; this was true even when the change was negative , such as a return to poor lighting .	0	psychology
 4040 . Today , I - O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice , as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter .	0	psychology
 The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology ( SIOP ) , a division of the APA , lists 8,000 members ( SIOP , 2014 ) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics — U.S .	0	psychology
 Department of Labor ( 2013 ) has projected this profession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the 20 years following 2012 .	0	psychology
 On average , a person with a master ’s degree in industrial - organizational psychology will earn over $ 80,000 a year , while someone with a doctorate will earn over $ 110,000 a year ( Khanna , Medsker , & Ginter , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 4043 . Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination .	0	psychology
 Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’s membership in a particular group ( Allport , 1954 ; Dovidio & Gaertner , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends .	0	psychology
 4049 . Prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms .	0	psychology
 Children learn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society : their parents , teachers , friends , the media , and other sources of socialization , such as Facebook ( O’Keeffe & Clarke - Pearson , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 4052 . When interacting with the target of our prejudice , we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations .	0	psychology
 In this process , known as confirmation bias , we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our stereotypes ( Wason & Johnson - Laird , 1972 ) .	1	psychology
 In the job interview example , the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging , and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview .	0	psychology
 4055 . Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in - groups , we develop in - group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups .	1	psychology
 This in - group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out - group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in - group .	0	psychology
 4058 . Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .	0	psychology
 Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .	1	psychology
 In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .	1	psychology
 4061 . One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying .	0	psychology
 Bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an adolescent , over time ( Olweus , 1993 ) .	1	psychology
 A one - time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying : Bullying is repeated behavior .	0	psychology
 4064 . This is a common occurrence , as the following well - publicized event demonstrates .	0	psychology
 In 1964 , in Queens , New York , a 19-year - old woman named Kitty Genovese was attacked by a person with a knife near the back entrance to her apartment building and again in the hallway inside her apartment building .	0	psychology
 When the attack occurred , she screamed for help numerous times and eventually died from her stab wounds .	0	psychology
 4070 . When you and another person share similar music taste , hobbies , food preferences , and so on , deciding what to do with your time together might be easy .	0	psychology
 Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks , including friendships , marriage , business relationships , and many other types of relationships , with others who are similar ( McPherson et al . , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 4073 . Robert Sternberg ( 1986 ) proposed that there are three components of love : intimacy , passion , and commitment .	0	psychology
 These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of love : this is known as Sternberg ’s triangular theory of love ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Intimacy is the sharing of details and intimate thoughts and emotions .	1	psychology
 4076 . Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion .	1	psychology
 Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .	1	psychology
 Finally , fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term sexual love affair .	1	psychology
 4079 . This allows the I - O psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly any type of occupation .	0	psychology
 This system is called O*Net ( accessible at www.online.onetcenter.org ) .	0	psychology
 The site is open and you can see the KSAs that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious about .	0	psychology
 4082 . Unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance , a decision based on group membership is discriminatory ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 To combat hiring discrimination , in the United States there are numerous city , state , and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group - membership criteria .	0	psychology
 For example , did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview ?	0	psychology
 4085 . The Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act make provisions for bona fide occupational qualifications ( BFOQs ) , which are requirements of certain occupations for which denying an individual employment would otherwise violate the law .	1	psychology
 For example , there may be cases in which religion , national origin , age , and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications .	0	psychology
 4088 . Job stress affects job satisfaction .	0	psychology
 Job stress , or job strain , is caused by specific stressors in an occupation .	0	psychology
 4091 . Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which the employee may schedule his arrival and departure from work to meet family demands .	0	psychology
 Telecommuting involves employees working at home and setting their own hours , which allows them to work during different parts of the day , and to spend part of the day with their family .	0	psychology
 Recall that Yahoo !	0	psychology
 4094 . In the Theory Y approach , on the other hand , managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction and fulfillment from their work .	1	psychology
 Employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in , and provide input about , setting their personal and work goals .	0	psychology
 4097 . Organizations need to respond quickly to changes in these factors .	0	psychology
 Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations so that work can be delegated to work teams , which bring together diverse skills , experience , and expertise .	0	psychology
 This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base ( Naquin & Tynan , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 4100 . One well - recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment , including sexual harassment .	0	psychology
 Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual harassment ( or harassment in general ) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and address it when it does occur .	0	psychology
 4103 . This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations .	0	psychology
 Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with or among employees .	1	psychology
 4106 . The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s , but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s ( Lyon , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 Today , we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states ; for example , we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated , angry , conflicted , overwhelmed , or fatigued .	0	psychology
 4109 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	0	psychology
 A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .	1	psychology
 Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .	0	psychology
 4112 . He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives .	0	psychology
 This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance .	1	psychology
 A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations .	0	psychology
 4115 . As previously stated , scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century .	0	psychology
 One of the early pioneers in the study of stress was Walter Cannon , an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In the early part of the 20th century , Cannon was the first to identify the body ’s physiological reactions to stress .	0	psychology
 4118 . These physiological reactions were nonspecific , which means that regardless of the type of stressor , the same pattern of reactions would occur .	0	psychology
 What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome , the body ’s nonspecific physiological response to stress .	1	psychology
 4121 . If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues .	0	psychology
 At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’s tissues and organs .	1	psychology
 4124 . In short bursts , this process can have some favorable effects , such as providing extra energy , improving immune system functioning temporarily , and decreasing pain sensitivity .	0	psychology
 However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price .	0	psychology
 4127 . For an individual to experience stress , he must first encounter a potential stressor .	0	psychology
 In general , stressors can be placed into one of two broad categories : chronic and acute .	0	psychology
 4130 . The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) uses the correlational research method to identify the connection between stress and health .	1	psychology
 That is , respondents’ LCU scores are correlated with the number or frequency of self - reported symptoms indicating health problems .	0	psychology
 4133 . Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout , which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one ’s job ( Maslach & Jackson , 1981 ) .	1	psychology
 Job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs ( e.g. , social workers , teachers , therapists , and police officers ) .	0	psychology
 4136 . In cases of comorbidity , the best treatment is thought to address both ( or multiple ) disorders simultaneously ( NIDA , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions , and in many cases , psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 4139 . In a sense , the immune system is the body ’s surveillance system .	0	psychology
 It consists of a variety of structures , cells , and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm or damage the body ’s tissues and organs .	0	psychology
 4142 . Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function .	0	psychology
 One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	1	psychology
 4145 . A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension , which is high blood pressure .	1	psychology
 Hypertension forces a person ’s heart to pump harder , thus putting more physical strain on the heart .	0	psychology
 4148 . In addition to anger and hostility , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative affectivity and depression ( Suls & Bunde , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease .	0	psychology
 4151 . Once a person seeks treatment , whether voluntarily or involuntarily , he has an intake done to assess his clinical needs .	0	psychology
 An intake is the therapist ’s first meeting with the client .	1	psychology
 4154 . In group therapy , a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 When children are placed in group therapy , it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems .	0	psychology
 4157 . There are several different types of family therapy .	0	psychology
 In structural family therapy , the therapist examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family : who makes the rules , who sleeps in the bed with whom , how decisions are made , and what are the boundaries within the family .	1	psychology
 In some families , the parents do not work together to make rules , or one parent may undermine the other , leading the children to act out .	0	psychology
 4160 . In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .	0	psychology
 Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychological disorders .	1	psychology
 First , we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in [ link ] ( many of these orientations were discussed in the Introduction chapter ) .	0	psychology
 4163 . Consequently , a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations .	0	psychology
 In dream analysis , a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams .	1	psychology
 4166 . Play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or engage in traditional talk therapy .	0	psychology
 This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to “ help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth ” ( O’Connor , 2000 , p. 7 ) .	1	psychology
 4169 . One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning : a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior .	1	psychology
 Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .	0	psychology
 4172 . Thirty years later , Joseph Wolpe ( 1958 ) refined Jones ’s techniques , giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today .	0	psychology
 A popular form of exposure therapy is systematic desensitization , wherein a calm and pleasant state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety - inducing stimuli .	1	psychology
 The idea is that you ca n’t be nervous and relaxed at the same time .	0	psychology
 4175 . Cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person ’s thoughts lead to feelings of distress .	1	psychology
 The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act .	0	psychology
 4178 . One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .	0	psychology
 Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009).Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .	1	psychology
 It aims to change cognitive distortions and self - defeating behaviors .	0	psychology
 4181 . Rogers ( 1951 ) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was sick and looking for a cure .	0	psychology
 Since this is a form of nondirective therapy , a therapeutic approach in which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts and understand feelings , Rogers ( 1951 ) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life to overcome life ’s challenges .	1	psychology
 4184 . Another biologically based treatment that continues to be used , although infrequently , is electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) ( formerly known by its unscientific name as electroshock therapy ) .	0	psychology
 It involves using an electrical current to induce seizures to help alleviate the effects of severe depression .	1	psychology
 4187 . As an example , suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class .	0	psychology
 If Bradford adopts a problem - focused coping approach to managing his stress , he would be proactive in trying to alleviate the source of the stress .	0	psychology
 He might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise his grade , he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments , and he may seek tutoring assistance .	0	psychology
 4190 . Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness : They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving .	1	psychology
 Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression .	0	psychology
 4193 . Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism - related stress .	0	psychology
 The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race - related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support .	0	psychology
 You ’ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership .	0	psychology
 4196 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :	1	psychology
 4199 . For practical purposes , a precise definition of happiness might incorporate each of these elements : an enduring state of mind consisting of joy , contentment , and other positive emotions , plus the sense that one ’s life has meaning and value ( Lyubomirsky , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 The definition implies that happiness is a long - term state — what is often characterized as subjective well - being — rather than merely a transient positive mood we all experience from time to time .	0	psychology
 4202 . In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 In a very general sense , positive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness ; it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualities that lead to greater fulfillment in our lives .	1	psychology
 This field looks at people ’s strengths and what helps individuals to lead happy , contented lives , and it moves away from focusing on people ’s pathology , faults , and problems .	0	psychology
 4205 . Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well - being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life .	0	psychology
 Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) .	1	psychology
 It is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) .	0	psychology
 4208 . In the 19th century , Dorothea Dix led reform efforts for mental health care in the United States ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 She investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for , and she discovered an underfunded and unregulated system that perpetuated abuse of this population ( Tiffany , 1891 ) .	0	psychology
 4211 . Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment .	0	psychology
 Voluntary treatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms .	1	psychology
 4214 . He called this condition early infantile autism , and it was characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others , speech and language abnormalities , repetitive behaviors , and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal routines ( Bregman , 2005 ) .	1	psychology
 What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today , is a direct extension of Kanner ’s work .	0	psychology
 2643 . Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity .	1	physics
 The object is called a projectile , and its path is called its trajectory .	1	physics
 2649 . Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers ( which should be close to zero ) .	0	physics
 Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity , which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon .	1	physics
 2652 . [ link](b ) is our first example of a free - body diagram , which is a technique used to illustrate all the external forces acting on a body .	0	physics
 The body is represented by a single isolated point ( or free body ) , and only those forces acting on the body from the outside ( external forces ) are shown .	1	physics
 2655 . External forces are any outside forces that act on a body .	1	physics
 A free - body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body .	1	physics
 2658 . The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity .	0	physics
 A change in velocity means , by definition , that there is an acceleration .	0	physics
 Newton ’s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion ; thus , we see that a net external force causes acceleration .	1	physics
 2661 . When the net external force on an object is its weight , we say that it is in free - fall .	1	physics
 That is , the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity .	0	physics
 2664 . Section SummaryNewton ’s third law of motion represents a basic symmetry in nature .	0	physics
 It states : Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body , the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that the first body exerts .	1	physics
 2667 . A tension is a force along the length of a medium , especially a force carried by a flexible medium , such as a rope or cable .	1	physics
 The word “ tension ” comes from a Latin word meaning “ to stretch . ” Not coincidentally , the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons .	0	physics
 2670 . You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air — you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion .	0	physics
 Like friction , the drag force always opposes the motion of an object .	0	physics
 Unlike simple friction , the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid .	0	physics
 2673 . Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge .	0	physics
 Each pit used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time .	0	physics
 The rotation angle is the amount of rotation and is analogous to linear distance .	1	physics
 2676 . Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force .	1	physics
 The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature , the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration .	0	physics
 2679 . To comprehend these vast ranges , we must also have accepted units in which to express them .	0	physics
 And we shall find that ( even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters , kilograms , and seconds ) a profound simplicity of nature appears — all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities : length , mass , time , and electric current . We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other measurements .	0	physics
 For example , we define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them , whereas we define average speed by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel .	0	physics
 2682 . It is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the procedure used to measure them .	1	physics
 2688 . The term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system .	1	physics
 2691 . A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult ( or impossible ) to display directly .	1	physics
 2700 . Average velocity is displacement ( change in position ) divided by the time of travel ,	1	physics
 2706 . When an object slows down , its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion .	1	physics
 In contrast , if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches , your measurement would not be very accurate . The precision of a measurement system is refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements ( which are repeated under the same conditions ) .	1	physics
 A vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction .	1	physics
 2739 . Inertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion .	1	physics
 If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another , then the friction between them is called kinetic friction .	1	physics
 2754 . Microgravity refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small compared with that produced by Earth at its surface .	1	physics
 A conservative force is one , like the gravitational force , for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken .	1	physics
 A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path taken .	1	physics
 2772 . The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate .	1	physics
 The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) and is divided among various systems in the body , as shown in [ link ] .	1	physics
 2775 . Renewable forms of energy are those sources that can not be used up , such as water , wind , solar , and biomass .	1	physics
 An elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy .	1	physics
 Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system .	1	physics
 2784 . Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system .	1	physics
