 The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen , with the brain coming next .	0	physics
 About 85 % of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels — oil , natural gas , coal .	0	physics
 The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use , with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion , has made , in the eyes of many scientists , a shift to non - fossil fuels of utmost importance — but it will not be easy .	0	physics
 2778 . In [ link ] , a very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the tennis ball .	0	physics
 A small force could cause the same change in momentum , but it would have to act for a much longer time .	0	physics
 For example , if the ball were thrown upward , the gravitational force ( which is much smaller than the tennis racquet ’s force ) would eventually reverse the momentum of the ball .	0	physics
 2781 . We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line — a one - dimensional problem .	0	physics

 2802 . You have no doubt heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood ( high or low blood pressure ) and in relation to the weather ( high- and low - pressure weather systems ) .	0	physics
 These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids .	0	physics
 2805 . Blood pressure measurements , like tire pressures , are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure . In brief , it is very common for pressure gauges to ignore atmospheric pressure — that is , to read zero at atmospheric pressure .	0	physics
 Gauge pressure is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure , and negative for pressures below it .	0	physics

 Such forces cause liquid drops to cling to window panes , for example .	0	physics
 2814 . If , however , it is too low , fainting is a problem .	0	physics
 Systolic pressure increases dramatically during exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal afterward .	0	physics
 This change produces no ill effects and , in fact , may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system .	0	physics

 2835 . The scientific definition of temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot and cold .	0	physics
 ( Many physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured .	0	physics
 2838 . That is , heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one until they have exactly the same temperature .	0	physics
 The objects are then in thermal equilibrium , and no further changes will occur .	0	physics
 The systems interact and change because their temperatures differ , and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same .	0	physics
 2841 . Thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction ( see Elasticity : Stress and Strain for a discussion of stress and strain ) .	0	physics
 Thermal stress can be destructive , such as when expanding gasoline ruptures a tank .	0	physics

 ( The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale — we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero . )	0	physics
 2862 . That is , the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin : no medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate .	0	physics
 Different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths : radio waves , microwaves , infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation , X - rays , and gamma rays . Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation .	0	physics
 The visible light , although dramatic , transfers relatively little thermal energy .	0	physics
 2865 . The first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat transfer and doing work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the system .	0	physics
 In equation form , the first law of thermodynamics is	0	physics

 2877 . This question was answered at a theoretical level in 1824 by a young French engineer , Sadi Carnot ( 1796–1832 ) , in his study of the then - emerging heat engine technology crucial to the Industrial Revolution .	0	physics
 He devised a theoretical cycle , now called the Carnot cycle , which is the most efficient cyclical process possible .	0	physics
 The second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the Carnot cycle , and so what Carnot actually discovered was this fundamental law .	0	physics
 2880 . There is yet another way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics .	0	physics
 This version relates to a concept called entropy .	0	physics
 By examining it , we shall see that the directions associated with the second law — heat transfer from hot to cold , for example — are related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work .	0	physics

 2889 . They are also the simplest oscillatory systems .	0	physics
 Such a system is underdamped ; its displacement is represented by the curve in [ link ] .	0	physics
 Curve B in [ link ] represents an overdamped system .	0	physics
 2895 . When you drive the ball at its natural frequency , the ball ’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it .	0	physics
 2898 . The water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it , called its wavelength	0	physics
 2901 . Luckily , the rules for adding waves are quite simple . When two or more waves arrive at the same point , they superimpose themselves on one another .	0	physics
 Each disturbance corresponds to a force , and forces add .	0	physics
 The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and , thus , is called a standing wave .	0	physics
 Waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves .	0	physics
" 2907 . Therefore , the fundamental frequency is f1=vw / λ1=vw/2Lf1=vw / λ1=vw/2L size 12{f rSub { size 8{1 } } = v rSub { size 8{w } } /λ rSub { size 8{1 } } = v rSub { size 8{w } } /2`""L "" } { } ."	0	physics
 In this case , the overtones or harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency .	0	physics
 As seen in [ link ] , the first harmonic can easily be calculated since λ2=Lλ2=L size 12{λ rSub { size 8{2 } } = L } { } .	0	physics
 Sound is a wave .	0	physics
 2919 . Real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using the thin lens equations , producing aberrations .	0	physics
 The fundamental is the first harmonic , the first overtone is the second harmonic , and so on .	0	physics
 2928 . The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities .	0	physics
 We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities tone quality , or more commonly the timbre of the sound .	0	physics
 It is more difficult to correlate timbre perception to physical quantities than it is for loudness or pitch perception .	0	physics
 2934 . Franklin wrote in his letters and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what caused the phenomenon .	0	physics
 Today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms , and that atoms contain positive and negative charges , usually in equal amounts .	0	physics
 [ link ] shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus .	0	physics
 The nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons .	0	physics
 These free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand .	0	physics
 Any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor .	0	physics
 3617 . Generally , you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D .	0	psychology
 If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues .	0	psychology
 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .	0	psychology
 3626 . The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing .	0	psychology
 Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates ( Grothe et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3635 . One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 3638 . Taste ( gustation ) and smell ( olfaction ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe .	0	psychology
 There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses .	0	psychology
 Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate .	0	psychology
 This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain ( or congenital analgesia ) .	0	psychology
 While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain .	0	psychology
 This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology .	0	psychology
 The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts .	0	psychology
 3656 . We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3659 . According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above .	0	psychology
 You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3662 . Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .	0	psychology
 For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 3665 . Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment .	0	psychology
 In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience .	0	psychology
 3668 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	0	psychology
 Before conditioning , think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this :	0	psychology
 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants’ footsteps .	0	psychology
 In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food .	0	psychology
 Here ’s how it works .	0	psychology
 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) .	0	psychology
 In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus .	0	psychology
 3683 . John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism .	0	psychology
 3686 . Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .	0	psychology
 His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt .	0	psychology
 3692 . In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) .	0	psychology
 For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy .	0	psychology
 Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal .	0	psychology
 3698 . Now let ’s combine these four terms .	0	psychology
 For example , June undergoes major surgery in a hospital .	0	psychology
 This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule .	0	psychology
 3704 . As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along .	0	psychology

 It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .	0	psychology
 3716 . In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial .	0	psychology
 For example , if you live in Essex Junction , Vermont , you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow .	0	psychology
 3719 . There are several types of schemata .	0	psychology
 For example , imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter .	0	psychology
 3722 . Language , be it spoken , signed , or written , has specific components : a lexicon and grammar .	0	psychology
 Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	0	psychology
 We use semantics and syntax to construct language .	0	psychology
 3728 . However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 3731 . A problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution .	0	psychology
 Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3734 . A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy .	0	psychology
 You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems .	0	psychology
 During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft .	0	psychology
 3740 . For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 3746 . James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 There was , however , considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct .	0	psychology
 3749 . Researchers Robert Yerkes ( pronounced “ Yerk - EES ” ) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3752 . Maslow ’s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives , individual characteristics , or social contexts , Abraham Maslow ( 1943 ) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social .	0	psychology
 These needs are often depicted as a pyramid ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well - developed short story .	0	psychology
 3767 . The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( Ahima & Antwi , 2008 ; Woods & D’Alessio , 2008 ) .	0	psychology
 3770 . OBESITYWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered overweight or obese .	0	psychology
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3773 . In cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity , bariatric surgery may be recommended .	0	psychology
 A recent meta - analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non - surgical treatment for obesity in the two - years immediately following the procedure , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( Gloy et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3776 . As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fifth edition , Binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 Unlike with bulimia , eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior , such as purging , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of guilt and embarrassment .	0	psychology
 3779 . Physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers .	0	psychology
 Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality , Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The results of some of these efforts were published in two books — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — which were published in 1948 and 1953 , respectively ( Bullough , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 3785 . Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 Orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension .	0	psychology
 In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 3788 . In reality , these are two related , but different , issues .	0	psychology
 Generally , our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3791 . While you ’re likely familiar with the term “ IQ ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does IQ really mean ?	0	psychology
 You ’ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more aptly , intelligences ) .	0	psychology
 3794 . Interestingly , the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect .	0	psychology
 Flynn himself argues , however , that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se ( Flynn , Shaughnessy , & Fulgham , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3797 . Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents .	0	psychology
 Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence .	0	psychology
 The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well - known twin studies .	0	psychology
 The physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person .	0	psychology
 3803 . Emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional .	0	psychology
 Mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion ( Beedie , Terry , Lane , & Devonport , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3806 . Other theorists , however , doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience .	0	psychology
 Thus , the Cannon - Bard theory of emotion was developed .	0	psychology
 3809 . The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate .	0	psychology
 This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious .	0	psychology
 3812 . The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 3815 . Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion .	0	psychology
 Therefore , people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion .	0	psychology
 3818 . We also use the tone of our voices , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language , even if we ’re not consciously aware of it ( de Gelder , 2006 ; Tamietto et al . , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3821 . In the centuries after Galen , other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types , most prominently Immanuel Kant ( in the 18th century ) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( in the 19th century ) ( Eysenck , 2009 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ; Wundt , 1874/1886 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Kant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories ( Eysenck , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3824 . LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESSTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He said that only about one - tenth of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious .	0	psychology
 3827 . It strives for perfection and judges our behavior , leading to feelings of pride or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of guilt .	0	psychology
 It ’s what Freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others .	0	psychology
 3830 . Eventually you forget about it .	0	psychology
 Similarly , in the human psyche , if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with , it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness ( Freud , 1920 ) .	0	psychology
 This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas .	0	psychology
 3833 . For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .	0	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking ( nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs ) play a large part in a baby ’s first year of life .	0	psychology
 This period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits , such as school , friendships , hobbies , and sports .	0	psychology
 3842 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology

 Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness .	0	psychology
 To see how visual encoding works , read over this list of words : car , level , dog , truth , book , value .	0	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 3860 . One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short - term memory storage .	0	psychology
 In other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red .	0	psychology
 Unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of LTM has no limits .	0	psychology
 It is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to brush your teeth , how to drive a car , how to swim the crawl ( freestyle ) stroke .	0	psychology
 The concept of episodic memory was first proposed about 40 years ago ( Tulving , 1972 ) .	0	psychology
 3872 . How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ?	0	psychology
 This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer ’s hard drive .	0	psychology
 3875 . The third form of retrieval is relearning , and it ’s just what it sounds like .	0	psychology
 3878 . First , let ’s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation .	0	psychology
 The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3881 . There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as epinephrine , dopamine , serotonin , glutamate , and acetylcholine ( Myhrer , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( Blockland , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 Although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories .	0	psychology
 3884 . In other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner , a strict behaviorist , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the enduring , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists .	0	psychology
 3890 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .	0	psychology
 In Rotter ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external locus of control ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology

 Thus , even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the mother , the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases .

 Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	0	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government

 Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch .	0	government

 President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover - up of key information relating to the 1972 break - in at the Democratic Party ’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex .	0	government
 Nixon likely would have also been removed by the Senate , since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal .	0	government
 6664 . No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office , starting with George Washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers .	0	government
 For example , Washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties , consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch .	0	government
 Today , the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president ’s advisers.https://www.justice.gov/about ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 And , in 1793 , when it became important for the United States to take a stand in the evolving European conflicts between France and other European powers , especially Great Britain , Washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat - in - chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived .	0	government
 6667 . Concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office , Jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted Congress ’s tacit approval of his actions .	0	government
 James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	0	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 6670 . Of the many ways in which the chief executive ’s power grew over the first several decades , the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers .	0	government
 While Washington , Adams , and Jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars , it was President James K. Polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority .	0	government
 In 1846 , as the United States and Mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where Texas ’s southern border lay , Polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in Mexico .	0	government
 6673 . Later , however , as president himself , Lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the Confederate effort to seek independence for the Southern states .	0	government
 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government

 1516 . The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks .	0	biology
 These layers form three distinct regions : an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids , a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids , and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens .	0	biology
 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin .	0	biology
 1522 . While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands , the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function .	0	biology
 Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone .	0	biology
 1528 . As blood osmolarity decreases , a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus , and ADH secretion is reduced .	0	biology
 ADH release can be reduced by certain substances , including alcohol , which can cause increased urine production and dehydration . Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus .	0	biology
 If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH , water can not be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine .	0	biology
 1534 . FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin , which is released by the testes .	0	biology
 LH stimulates production of the sex hormones ( androgens ) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell - stimulating hormone .	0	biology
 1537 . Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .	0	biology
 PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .	0	biology
 The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks .	0	biology
 1540 . This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .	0	biology
 High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine , resulting in glucose being lost in urine .	0	biology
 1543 . When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .	0	biology
 Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells .	0	biology
 1546 . T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .	0	biology

 This structure allows rotational movement , as the rounded bone moves around its own axis .	0	biology
 1639 . Ball - and - Socket JointsBall - and - socket joints possess a rounded , ball - like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone .	1	biology
 This organization allows the greatest range of motion , as all movement types are possible in all directions .	0	biology
 1642 . Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines , stomach , and urinary bladder , and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels .	0	biology
 Smooth muscle has no striations , is not under voluntary control , has only one nucleus per cell , is tapered at both ends , and is called involuntary muscle .	1	biology
 1645 . The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils — long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber .	1	biology
 Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber , and because they are only approximately 1.2 µm in diameter , hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber .	0	biology
 1648 . There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .	0	biology
 Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .	0	biology
 Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .	0	biology
 1651 . Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .	1	biology
 Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .	1	biology

 1681 . From the nasal cavity , air passes through the pharynx ( throat ) and the larynx ( voice box ) , as it makes its way to the trachea ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body .	0	biology
 1684 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .	0	biology
 1687 . They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 As the passageways decrease in diameter , the relative amount of smooth muscle increases . The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles .	0	biology
 The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts .	0	biology
 1690 . The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust , dirt , viral particles , and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses .	0	biology
 The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage .	0	biology
 1693 . At maximal capacity , an average lung can hold almost six liters of air , but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity .	0	biology
 Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Volume measures the amount of air for one function ( such as inhalation or exhalation ) .	1	biology
 1696 . It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .	1	biology
 The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .	1	biology
 1699 . It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 The inspiratory capacity ( IC ) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration .	1	biology
 It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1702 . Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .	0	biology
 An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .	1	biology
 1705 . Gas Exchange across the AlveoliIn the body , oxygen is used by cells of the body ’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product .	0	biology
 The ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient ( RQ ) .	1	biology
 RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0 .	0	biology
 1708 . No muscles are contracting to expel the air . Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac .	0	biology
 The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura .	1	biology
 A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1711 . The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate .	1	biology
 On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .	0	biology
 1714 . This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid - air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together .	0	biology
 Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli .	1	biology
 By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid , it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse .	0	biology
 1717 . Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis .	0	biology
 In both diseases , the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic .	0	biology
 1720 . It is also independent of cardiac output .	0	biology
 This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment , which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases .	1	biology
 As cardiac output increases , the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused ( filled with blood ) increases .	1	biology
 1723 . Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place .	1	biology
 Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt , arises from an anatomical failure , while physiological dead space or physiological shunt , arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries .	1	biology
 1726 . The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood ( x - axis ) versus the relative Hb - oxygen saturation ( y - axis ) .	1	biology
 The resulting graph — an oxygen dissociation curve — is sigmoidal , or S - shaped ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 As the partial pressure of oxygen increases , the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen .	0	biology
 1729 . This is painful when it occurs .	0	biology
 Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb .	1	biology
 Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells , but these cells have lower - than - normal levels of hemoglobin .	0	biology
 1732 . In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	0	biology
 Carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) .	0	biology
 Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions	1	biology
 1735 . As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .	1	biology
 As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .	0	biology
 1738 . The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	1	biology
 This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .	0	biology
 1741 . As shown in [ link]b , amphibians have a three - chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two - chambered heart of fish .	0	biology
 The two atria ( superior heart chambers ) receive blood from the two different circuits ( the lungs and the systems ) , and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart ’s ventricle ( inferior heart chamber ) , which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation .	1	biology
 The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body .	0	biology
 1744 . Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones , and by removing waste .	0	biology
 Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease - fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection .	0	biology
 1747 . The atria are the chambers that receive blood , and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood .	1	biology
 The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava , which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms , as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs .	1	biology
 In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .	1	biology
 1750 . The left atrium then receives the oxygen - rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins .	0	biology
 This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve ( the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart ) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta , the major artery of the body , taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body .	1	biology
 Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta , the aortic semilunar valve ( or aortic valve ) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle .	0	biology
 1753 . The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1756 . The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques .	1	biology
 Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .	0	biology
 1759 . The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 In each cardiac cycle , the heart contracts ( systole ) , pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body ; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( diastole ) , where the heart fills with blood , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The atria contract at the same time , forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles .	0	biology
 1762 . The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes .	0	biology
 This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram ( ECG)—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle .	1	biology
 1765 . Arterioles diverge into capillary beds .	0	biology
 Capillary beds contain a large number ( 10 to 100 ) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body .	0	biology
 Capillaries are narrow - diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients , waste , and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level .	1	biology
 1768 . In capillaries , this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells , as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis .	0	biology
 The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction , narrowing of the blood vessels , and vasodilation , widening of the blood vessels ; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure .	1	biology
 1771 . Throughout the cardiac cycle , the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate .	1	biology
 This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance .	0	biology
 1774 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 1777 . The body ’s fluids include blood plasma , the cytosol within cells , and interstitial fluid , the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body .	1	biology
 The membranes of the body ( such as the pleural , serous , and cell membranes ) are semi - permeable membranes .	0	biology
 Semi - permeable membranes are permeable ( or permissive ) to certain types of solutes and water .	1	biology
 1780 . The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 If the solvent is water , one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water .	0	biology
 1783 . The kidneys , illustrated in [ link ] , are a pair of bean - shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity .	1	biology
 The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands .	0	biology
 1786 . The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	1	biology
 1789 . The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .	1	biology
 The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 1792 . There are , on average , eight renal pyramids in each kidney .	0	biology
 The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .	1	biology
 The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 1795 . On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	1	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1798 . The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 1801 . Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex , giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally .	0	biology
 There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .	0	biology
 A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries .	0	biology
 1804 . The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function .	1	biology
 The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	0	biology
 1807 . The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered .	0	biology
 The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole .	1	biology
 The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole .	1	biology
 1810 . In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	1	biology
 In juxtamedullary nephrons , the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta .	0	biology
 1813 . Water is also reabsorbed during this step .	0	biology
 Then , additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion , which is , in essence , the opposite process to tubular reabsorption .	0	biology
 The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae .	0	biology

 6467 . Why do we have two parties ?	0	government
 The two - party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections , with one seat tied to a geographic district , tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties .	0	government
 Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office .	0	government
 6470 . Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .	0	government
 In 1860 , four candidates competed for the presidency : Lincoln , a Republican ; two Democrats , one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party , a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery .	0	government
 6473 . Abandoning plurality voting , even if the winner - take - all election were kept , would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose .	0	government
 The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme , in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters .	1	government
 If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top contenders .	0	government
 6476 . Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the Electoral College , demobilized ethnicity , and campaign and election laws .	0	government
 First , the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College .	0	government

 The party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates .	1	government
 It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “ brand . ” It also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office .	0	government

 6503 . Several conflicting theories have been offered .	0	government
 The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position . Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 .	0	government
 According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns .	0	government
 Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics .	0	government
 6506 . Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	1	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government

 Anti - Federalists preferred a more confederate system built on state equality and autonomy . Saul Cornell .	0	government
 2016 . 6518 .	0	government
 However , members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views , but also in winning other elections .	0	government
 Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .	0	government
 The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .	0	government
 6521 . Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .	0	government
 However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .	0	government
 The Twelfth Amendment limited the House ’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes .	0	government
 6524 . New York : Oxford University Press , 330 - 34 .	0	government
 Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends .	0	government
 These men were the leaders of political machines , organizations that secured votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways .	1	government
 Perhaps more importantly , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed . Sean Wilentz .	0	government
 6527 . Roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the Progressive Party , as an alternative to the more business - minded Republicans .	0	government
 The Progressives sought to correct the many problems that had arisen as the United States transformed itself from a rural , agricultural nation into an increasingly urbanized , industrialized country dominated by big business interests .	1	government
 6530 . On April 15 ( or “ tax day ” ) , 2010 , members of the Tea Party movement rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in favor of smaller government and against the Affordable Care Act ( left ) .	0	government
 Two years later , supporters of the law ( right ) demonstrated in front of the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , in which the Court eventually upheld most provisions of the law .	0	government

 6533 . Formally , a lobbyist is someone who represents the interest organization before government , is usually compensated for doing so , and is required to register with the government in which he or she lobbies , whether state or federal .	1	government
 The lobbyist ’s primary goal is usually to influence policy .	0	government
 6536 . “ Interest Groups in the States . ” In Politics in the American States .	0	government
 Washington , DC : CQ Press , 105–131 .	0	government
 First , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues .	1	government
 Membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views .	0	government
 6539 . Interest groups also include associations , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade associations ) , and have similar concerns .	0	government
 The American Beverage Associationhttp://www.ameribev.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 includes Coca - Cola , Red Bull North America , ROCKSTAR , and Kraft Foods .	0	government
 6542 . While influencing policy is the primary goal , interest groups also monitor government activity , serve as a means of political participation for members , and provide information to the public and to lawmakers .	0	government
 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , by November 2015 , thirty - six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls.http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx ( November 78 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights .	0	government
 This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) .	0	government
 6545 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .	0	government
 Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .	1	government
 These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement .	0	government
 6548 . Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems .	0	government
 For instance , political scientist Robert Salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals . Robert Salisbury , “ An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups , ” Midwest Journal of Political Science 13 ( 1969 ) : 1–32 ; Peter B. Clark and James Q. Wilson , “ Incentive Systems : A Theory of Organizations , ” Administration Science Quarterly 6 ( 1961 ) : 129–166 .	0	government
 Some offer material incentives , which are tangible benefits of joining a group .	1	government
 AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .	0	government
 1951 . 6554 .	0	government
 Rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances .	0	government
 When , during his presidential candidacy , Donald Trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many rallied both for and against him . Jenna Johnson , “ Immigration continues to be Donald Trump ’s rallying issue , ” Washington Post , 22 October 2015 , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/immigration-continues-to-be-donald-trumps-rallying-issue/.Protestors take to the streets on different sides of the immigration issue .	0	government
 Some argue that the United States is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration .	0	government
 6557 . Joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community .	0	government
 Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level .	1	government
 Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .	0	government
 6560 . On the other hand , stem cell research is highly salient to members of the American Neurological Association , an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists .	0	government
 Accordingly , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community , but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs .	0	government
 Such was also the case when several unions split from the AFL - CIO ( American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , the nation ’s largest federation of unions , in 2005.Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Interest Groups in the States , ” 1991 , 1996 , 1999 , 2004 ; Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Nationalization of Interest Groups and Lobbying in the States . ” Improved technology and the development of social media have made it easier for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members .	0	government
 6563 . However , not all scholars accept the premise that mobilization is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision - makers .	0	government
 The elite critique suggests that certain interests , typically businesses and the wealthy , are advantaged and that policies more often reflect their wishes than anyone else ’s .	1	government
 Political scientist E. E. Schattschneider noted that “ the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upperclass accent.”E .	0	government
 E. Schattschneider .	0	government
 6566 . While most scholars agree that some interests do have advantages , others have questioned the overwhelming dominance of certain interests .	0	government
 Additionally , neopluralist scholars argue that certainly some interests are in a privileged position , but these interests do not always get what they want . Virginia Gray and David Lowery .	0	government
 1996 . 6569 .	0	government
 In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court upheld Congress ’s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates .	1	government
 However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .	0	government
 In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .	1	government
 6572 . Some continued to argue that campaign expenditures are a form of speech , a position with which two recent Supreme Court decisions are consistent .	0	government
 The Citizens United v. Federal Election CommissionCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 08 - 205 , 558 U.S. 310 ( 2010 ) .	0	government
 and the McCutcheon v. Federal Election CommissionMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , 12 - 536 , 572 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections .	0	government
 Citizens United overturned the soft money ban of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections .	1	government
 6575 . While the Supreme Court has paved the way for increased spending in politics , lobbying is still regulated in many ways . Adam J. Newmark , “ Measuring State Legislative Lobbying Regulation , 1990–2003 . ” State Politics and Policy Quarterly 5 ( 2005 ) : 182–191 ; Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ” The 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act defined who can and can not lobby , and requires lobbyists and interest groups to register with the federal government . Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .	0	government
 The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 further increased restrictions on lobbying .	0	government
 For example , the act prohibited contact between members of Congress and lobbyists who were the spouses of other Congress members .	0	government
 6578 . States deep in debt were printing increasingly worthless paper currency , many were mired in interstate trade battles with each other , and in western Massachusetts , a small group of Revolutionary War veterans angry over the prospect of losing their farms broke into armed open revolt against the state , in what came to be known as Shays’ Rebellion .	1	government
 The conclusion many reached was that the Articles of Confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together .	0	government
 In the spring of 1787 , a convention was called , and delegates from all the states ( except Rhode Island , which boycotted the convention ) were sent to Philadelphia to hammer out a solution to this central problem .	0	government
 6581 . The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .	0	government
 The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .	1	government
 The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .	0	government
 6584 . Congressional apportionment today is achieved through the equal proportions method , which uses a mathematical formula to allocate seats based on U.S. Census Bureau population data , gathered every ten years as required by the Constitution .	1	government
 At the close of the first U.S. Congress in 1791 , there were sixty - five representatives , each representing approximately thirty thousand citizens .	0	government
 6587 . While the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals , nearly quintupling the number of African American representatives in Congress in just over two decades , they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice , gerrymandering .	0	government
 Gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate .	1	government
 6590 . An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .	1	government
 In this section , we will learn about each type of power and the foundations of legitimacy they claim .	0	government
 6593 . But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	0	government
 Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .	0	government
 When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .	0	government
 6596 . But presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the expense of the Congress .	0	government
 By the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and Congress least powerful .	0	government
 For example , President Abraham Lincoln , who oversaw the prosecution of the Civil War , stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states.“Abraham Lincoln : Impact and Legacy , ” http://millercenter.org­/president/biography/lincoln-impact-and-legacy ( May 24 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6599 . Following the twin scandals of Vietnam and Watergate in the early 1970s , Congress attempted to assert itself as a coequal branch , even in creating foreign policy , but could not hold back the trend .	0	government
 The War Powers Resolution ( covered in the foreign policy chapter ) was intended to strengthen congressional war powers but ended up clarifying presidential authority in the first sixty days of a military conflict .	0	government
 The war on terrorism after 9/11 has also strengthened the president ’s hand .	0	government
 6602 . Another important reform occurred in 2002 , when Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russell Feingold ( D - WI ) drafted , and Congress passed , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain - Feingold Act .	0	government
 The purpose of this law was to limit the use of “ soft money , ” which is raised for purposes like party - building efforts , get - out - the - vote efforts , and issue - advocacy ads .	1	government
 6605 . In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .	0	government
 A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .	1	government
 Such PACs tended to be run by businesses and other groups , like the Teamsters Union and the National Rifle Association , to support their special interests .	0	government
 6608 . Despite the power of the conferences , however , the most important leadership position in the House is actually elected by the entire body of representatives .	0	government
 This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .	0	government
 The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty - four Speakers have been .	0	government
 6611 . However , the majority rules the day in the House , like a cartel .	0	government
 On the majority side , because it holds the speakership , the majority leader also has considerable power .	0	government
 Historically , moreover , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current Speaker steps down .	0	government
 6614 . There are well over two hundred committees , subcommittees , select committees , and joint committees in the Congress .	0	government
 The core committees are called standing committees .	1	government
 There are twenty standing committees in the House and sixteen in the Senate ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6617 . In 2016 , Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa ( a ) , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , despite the urging of his committee colleagues .	0	government
 In the meantime , Garland met with numerous senators , such as Republican Susan Collins of Maine ( b ) .	0	government
 6620 . Once hearings have been completed , the bill enters the markup stage .	0	government
 This is essentially an amending and voting process .	1	government
 6623 . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .	0	government
 This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government
 6626 . In a defining moment for the filibuster , Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for twenty - four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in 1957 .	0	government
 A vocal proponent of segregation and white supremacy , Thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform .	0	government
 6629 . Some interests groups form political action committees ( PACs ) , groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues .	1	government
 As [ link ] makes apparent , many large corporations like Honeywell International , AT&T , and Lockheed Martin form PACs to distribute money to candidates.https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Other PACs are either politically or ideologically oriented .	0	government
 6632 . For example , a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti - tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation .	0	government
 Prior to the election in 2012 , political activist Grover Norquist , the founder of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , asked all Republican members of Congress to sign a “ Taxpayer Protection Pledge ” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts .	0	government
 Ninety - five percent of the Republicans in Congress signed the pledge . Sean Lengell , “ Boehner : Grover Norquist Just a ‘ Random’ Guy , ” Washington Times , 3 November 2011 , http://www.washingtontimes.com / blog / inside - politics/2011/nov/3/boehner - grover - norquist - just - random - guy/ .	0	government
 Some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives .	0	government
 6635 . They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress .	0	government
 This is the delegate model of representation .	0	government
 6638 . Instead , proper representation for some is rooted in the racial , ethnic , socioeconomic , gender , and sexual identity of the representatives themselves .	1	government
 This form of representation is called descriptive representation .	0	government
 6641 . The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .	1	government
 For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .	0	government
 Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth , when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska .	0	government
 6644 . And as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with addressing those constituents’ interests .	0	government
 Historically , this job has included what some have affectionately called “ bringing home the bacon ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call pork - barrel politics .	0	government
 As a term and a practice , pork - barrel politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward .	1	government
 6647 . Indeed , when the ratings are graphed , the two noticeable peaks are at 57 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2001 ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In 1998 , according to Gallup polling , the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures , including President Bill Clinton ’s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy .	0	government
" In 2001 , approval spiked after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Bush administration launched the "" War on Terror , "" sending troops first to Afghanistan and later to Iraq ."	0	government
 6650 . The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .	0	government
 The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .	0	government
 He proposed that Congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely undefined .	0	government
 6653 . By early September , the Electoral College had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection .	0	government
 This process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections .	0	government
 6656 . This should have meant that Texas ’s 32 electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other .	0	government
 Cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in Wyoming , where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier . Alan Clendenning , “ Court : Cheney Is Wyoming Resident , ” ABC News , 7 December 2000 , http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122289&page=1 ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It ’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was , but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution , that was a real possibility .	0	government
 6659 . An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive — impeachment .	0	government
 Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing ; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors .	1	government
 6662 . The most recent impeachment was of President Bill Clinton , brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .	0	government
 House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton ’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment .	0	government
 6665 . Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers .	0	government
 Some waged undeclared wars , as John Adams did against the French in the Quasi - War ( 1798–1800 ) .	0	government
 Others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains , as Thomas Jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of Louisiana from France .	0	government
 6668 . James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	1	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States .	0	government
 6671 . He then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending U.S. troops to the Rio Grande , the border Texan expansionists claimed for Texas .	0	government
 Mexico sent troops in response , and the Mexican - American War began soon afterward . Fred Greenstein .	0	government
 2010 . 6674 .	0	government
 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government
 He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .	0	government
 His successor , Andrew Johnson , became so embroiled with Radical Republicans about ways to implement Reconstruction policies and programs after the Civil War that the House of Representatives impeached him , although the legislators in the Senate were unable to successfully remove him from office . Michael Les Benedict .	0	government
 6677 . Constitution , Article II , Section 1 .	0	government
 As the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .	0	government
 Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege , the right to withhold information from Congress , the judiciary , or the public .	1	government
 This right , not enumerated in the Constitution , was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch . Mark J. Rozel .	0	government
 6680 . Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized , amended , and approved by Congress .	0	government
 However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 6683 . Following the first election of Washington , the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process , creating separate nomination and general election stages .	0	government
 Early on , the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus .	0	government
 The caucus or large - scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties .	1	government
 6686 . The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars’ control of the process of candidate selection .	0	government
 Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote .	0	government
 6689 . When Washington declined to run again after two terms , matters worsened .	0	government
 In 1796 , political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively .	0	government
 Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams ’s administration , much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello .	0	government
 6692 . Following the 2000 presidential election , when then - governor George W. Bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger , astonished voters called for Electoral College reform .	0	government
 Years later , however , nothing of any significance had been done .	0	government
 1989 . 6698 .	0	government
 The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .	0	government
 Instead , however , Senator Ted Cruz used the confirmation hearing to question the Vietnam War hero ’s patriotism .	0	government
 Hagel was eventually confirmed by a 58–41 vote .	0	government
 6701 . When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .	0	government
 Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .	0	government
 6704 . But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that ’s inclined to obstruct .	0	government
 Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments , respectively .	0	government
 President Obama has made far fewer recess appointments ; as of May 1 , 2015 , he had made only thirty - two . Bruce Drake , “ Obama lags his predecessors in recess appointments , ” 13 January 2014 , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/obama-lags-his-predecessors-in-recess-appointments/ ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , the pro forma session .	0	government
 6707 . Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration , often with a sharp edge .	0	government
 Richard Nixon ’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example .	0	government
 But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .	0	government
 6710 . In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .	0	government
 Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .	0	government
 President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure .	0	government
 7023 . The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years .	0	government
 The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II .	0	government
 The president negotiates a treaty , the Senate consents to the treaty by a two - thirds vote , and finally the president ratifies it .	0	government
 7026 . On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .	0	government
 In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law . United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .	0	government
 Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .	0	government
 Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement .	0	government
 7029 . Madeleine Albright ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was nominated by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the Senate 99–0 .	0	government
 Colin Powell ( b ) , nominated by George W. Bush , was also unanimously confirmed .	0	government
 7032 . These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president , including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis , executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises .	1	government
 These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “ energy and dispatch ” that Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency .	0	government

 4636 . Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .	0	economic
 We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States . Measuring Income Distribution by QuintilesOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .	1	economic
 4642 . The programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor .	1	economic
 Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .	0	economic
 4645 . The United States does have an estate tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance .	1	economic
 However , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $ 5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth .	0	economic
 4648 . What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ?	0	economic
 To analyze these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor .	0	economic
 If no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( E ) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor ( D ) and the supply of labor ( S ) in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4651 . In the past , presidential use of the Taft - Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but , in this case , it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement . In other instances , unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies .	0	economic
 In one prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor - saving machinery in the mines .	0	economic
 The mineworkers’ union realized that over time , the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines , but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity .	0	economic
 4654 . Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion .	1	economic
 There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which arises if workers with the same skill levels — as measured by education , experience , and expertise — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender .	0	economic
 4657 . If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers .	0	economic
 In a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , hiring , and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors .	0	economic

 As such , many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information , where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information ( one party knows much more than the other ) .	1	economic
 4669 . For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality .	0	economic
 If there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions .	0	economic
 4672 . When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products , then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity .	0	economic
 Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity .	0	economic
 4675 . In the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back guarantee , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality .	1	economic
 This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail - order catalogs or over the web , whose customers can not see the actual products , because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it .	0	economic
 4678 . Sellers of labor provide information through resumes , recommendations , school transcripts , and examples of their work .	0	economic
 Occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market .	0	economic

 4681 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .	1	economic
 4687 . Pension insurance : Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised .	1	economic
 4690 . Retirement insurance : All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly .	1	economic
 Social Security and Medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits .	0	economic
 4693 . Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs .	0	economic
 For example , insurance policies often have deductibles , which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying .	1	economic
 For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .	0	economic
 4696 . A final way of reducing moral hazard , which is especially applicable to health care , is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care , rather than consumers .	0	economic
 Traditionally , most health care in the United States has been provided on a fee - for - service basis , which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services .	1	economic
 However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .	0	economic

 Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years , or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years , or starts a research and development project .	0	economic
 Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by reinvesting profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( 4 ) by selling stock .	0	economic
 4711 . In this way , an individual investor could , in effect , loan the firm $ 5,000 , or any multiple of that amount .	0	economic
 Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder .	1	economic
 If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .	0	economic

 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 The stock of a company is divided into shares .	0	economic

 4726 . A high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years .	0	economic
 The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time .	1	economic
 4729 . A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades , as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month .	0	economic
 4732 . Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds .	1	economic
 A number of today ’s well - known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft .	0	economic
 4735 . ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )	0	economic
 The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .	1	economic
 Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .	0	economic
 4738 . [ link ] shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds : 10-year Treasury bonds ( which are officially called “ notes ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody ’s , an independent firm that publishes such ratings .	0	economic
 Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together .	0	economic
 4741 . Purchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the Internet age , but it remains something of a task .	0	economic
 To simplify the process , companies offer mutual funds , which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies .	1	economic
 The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs .	0	economic
 4744 . The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing .	0	economic
 Thus , in attempting to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication .	0	economic
 4750 . For example , many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made — they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it .	0	economic
 In September 2009 , President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff ( taxes added on imported goods ) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year , 30 percent in its second year , and 25 percent in its third year .	1	economic
 Interestingly , the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step , because most of them also import tires from China and other countries .	0	economic
 4753 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic

 Thus , when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly ask each other to include pork - barrel spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district .	1	economic
 Pork - barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs : the benefits of pork - barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country .	0	economic

 4798 . So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries , or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ?	0	economic
 This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population .	1	economic
 4801 . GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society .	0	economic
 GDP per capita is only an average .	0	economic
 When GDP per capita rises by 5 % , it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5 % , or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less — or even declined .	0	economic

 To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita .	0	economic
 Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like Belgium , Uruguay , or Zimbabwe , with countries that have larger populations , like the United States , the Russian Federation , or Nigeria .	0	economic

 4822 . A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns .	0	economic
 Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita , the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish .	1	economic
 For example , raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth - grade level to a high school diploma ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output .	0	economic

 4831 . The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy .	0	economic
 During periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high .	0	economic
 During periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower .	0	economic
 4834 . The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( i.e .	1	economic
 the business cycle ) is known as cyclical unemployment .	0	economic
 4837 . One set of reasons why wages may be “ sticky downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions .	0	economic
 For low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages .	0	economic
 For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike .	0	economic
 4840 . Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate .	1	economic
 One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary .	0	economic
 4843 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others .	0	economic
 4846 . But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job .	0	economic
 The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment .	1	economic
 Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing .	0	economic
 4849 . Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy .	1	economic
 Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices .	0	economic
 4852 . To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy .	0	economic
 The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time .	0	economic
 4855 . Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices .	0	economic
 The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 .	0	economic
 4858 . A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption .	0	economic
 Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen .	1	economic
 4861 . The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods .	0	economic
 For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services .	1	economic
 It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .	0	economic
 4864 . An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	0	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 Unlike the CPI , its baskets are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s GDP would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices .	0	economic
 4867 . Inflation in China averaged about 10 % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has dropped off since then .	0	economic
 Russia experienced hyperinflation — an outburst of high inflation — of 2,500 % per year in the early 1990s , although by 2006 Russia ’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10 % per year , as shown in [ link ] .	1	economic
 The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War , 1860–1865 , in the Confederate states . Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates , 1980–2013These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in Brazil , China , and Russia .	0	economic
 4870 . Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation .	0	economic
 If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .	0	economic
 4873 . Moreover , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful , prolonged conflicts between employers and employees .	0	economic
 If the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently , minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link].U.S .	0	economic
 Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation , the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010 , even though the nominal figure climbed from $ 1.40 to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 4876 . Prices are the messengers in a market economy , conveying information about conditions of demand and supply .	0	economic
 Inflation blurs those price messages .	0	economic
 4879 . Second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible .	0	economic
 The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result .	0	economic
 4882 . In the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost - of - living adjustments ( COLAs ) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation .	1	economic
 These contracts were sometimes written as , for example , COLA plus 3 % .	0	economic
 4885 . Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	0	economic
 This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base . As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing , in 1996 the U.S. , government began offering indexed bonds .	0	economic
 Bonds are means by which the U.S. government ( and many private - sector companies as well ) borrows money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government repays the money with interest .	1	economic
 4888 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	0	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic
 If exports and imports are equal , then trade is balanced .	0	economic
 4891 . Old habits are hard to break .	0	economic
 Economists , however , typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid .	0	economic
 4894 . The second row of [ link ] provides data on trade in services .	0	economic
 Here , the U.S. economy is running a surplus .	0	economic
 Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .	0	economic
 4897 . Some of the other countries listed include Brazil , the largest economy in Latin America ; Nigeria , the largest economy in Africa ; and China , India , and Korea .	0	economic
 The first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP .	0	economic
 The second column shows the trade balance .	0	economic
 4900 . The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments .	0	economic
 Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy .	0	economic
 4903 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ?	0	economic
 4906 . For most years of the nineteenth century , U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit .	0	economic
 Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900 .	0	economic
 4909 . The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade .	0	economic
 The United States has a low level of trade , but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s .	0	economic
 4912 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .	0	economic
 Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .	1	economic
 3918 . You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36 , 6 x 7 = 42 , and 6 x 8 = 48 .	0	psychology
 Memorizing these facts is rehearsal . Another strategy is chunking : you organize information into manageable bits or chunks ( Bodie , Powers , & Fitch - Hauser , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers .	0	psychology
 3921 . Use elaborative rehearsal : In a famous article , Craik and Lockhart ( 1972 ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory .	1	psychology
 Their theory is called levels of processing .	0	psychology
 If we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful .	0	psychology
 3924 . Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .	1	psychology
 Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .	1	psychology
 We refer to these domains throughout the chapter .	0	psychology
 3927 . Not all normative events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures .	0	psychology
 Biological milestones , such as puberty , tend to be universal , but social milestones , such as the age when children begin formal schooling , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 For example , in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old , but in developing countries , like Nigeria , children often enter school at an advanced age , if at all ( Huebler , 2005 ; United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization [ UNESCO ] , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3930 . How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?Are we who we are because of nature ( biology and genetics ) , or are we who we are because of nurture ( our environment and culture ) ? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate .	1	psychology
 3933 . Humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another .	0	psychology
 A poignant example is that of Trayvon Martin , a 17-year - old African American who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer , George Zimmerman , in a predominantly White neighborhood in 2012 .	0	psychology
 Zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin .	0	psychology
 3936 . Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .	0	psychology
 Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .	0	psychology
 3939 . Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world .	0	psychology
 Schemata are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information .	1	psychology
 By the time children have reached adulthood , they have created schemata for almost everything .	0	psychology
 3942 . The first stage is the sensorimotor stage , which lasts from birth to about 2 years old .	1	psychology
 During this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior .	0	psychology
 3945 . Kenny ’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces , so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did .	0	psychology
 Children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added .	1	psychology
 3948 . Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition .	1	psychology
 Take , for example , water that you poured into the short , fat glass : You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a couple of drops ) .	0	psychology
 3951 . After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas , Kohlberg reviewed people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 According to Kohlberg , an individual progresses from the capacity for pre - conventional morality ( before age 9 ) to the capacity for conventional morality ( early adolescence ) , and toward attaining post - conventional morality ( once formal operational thought is attained ) , which only a few fully achieve .	0	psychology
 3954 . Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .	1	psychology
 Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .	1	psychology
 3957 . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .	1	psychology
 An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .	1	psychology
 Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective .	0	psychology
 3960 . Therefore , a person ’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001).People from collectivistic cultures , such as some Asian cultures , are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual .	1	psychology
 Activities such as ( a ) preparing a meal , ( b ) hanging out , and ( c ) playing a game engage people in a group .	0	psychology
 3963 . We can understand self - serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution , a belief about the cause of a result .	1	psychology
 One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions : locus of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus unstable ) , and controllability ( controllable versus uncontrollable ) .	0	psychology
 3966 . A mother and father ’s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of conception .	0	psychology
 Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .	0	psychology
 3969 . After the zygote divides for about 7–10 days and has 150 cells , it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus .	1	psychology
 Upon implantation , this multi - cellular organism is called an embryo .	0	psychology
 Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .	0	psychology
 3972 . A teratogen is any environmental agent — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus .	1	psychology
 There are different types of teratogens .	0	psychology
 3975 . Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .	1	psychology
 Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 3978 . In social and emotional development , forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy .	0	psychology
 Attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others .	1	psychology
 Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone .	0	psychology
 3981 . With avoidant attachment , the child is unresponsive to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves .	1	psychology
 The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger .	0	psychology
 3984 . Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles : authoritative , authoritarian , permissive , and uninvolved .	0	psychology
 With the authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits , expresses warmth and affection , and listens to the child ’s point of view .	1	psychology
 Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them .	0	psychology
 3987 . With the uninvolved style of parenting , the parents are indifferent , uninvolved , and sometimes referred to as neglectful .	1	psychology
 They do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands .	0	psychology
 3990 . While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable , the onset and pace of puberty vary widely .	0	psychology
 Several physical changes occur during puberty , such as adrenarche and gonadarche , the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively .	0	psychology
 Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .	0	psychology
 3993 . Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .	1	psychology
 3996 . Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support .	0	psychology
 As we get older , socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( Carstensen , 1992 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3999 . This shared knowledge comes from social norms .	0	psychology
 A social norm is a group ’s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 How are we expected to act ?	0	psychology
 4002 . ZIMBARDO ’S STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENTThe famous Stanford prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues at Stanford University , demonstrated the power of social roles , social norms , and scripts .	0	psychology
 In the summer of 1971 , an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life .	0	psychology
 4005 . Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .	0	psychology
 Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .	1	psychology
 We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies .	0	psychology
 4008 . The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like the group more , due to the justification of effort .	0	psychology
 We do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave .	0	psychology
 4011 . The topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology ( Fiske et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 During the Second World War , Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army .	0	psychology
 After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .	0	psychology
 4014 . The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument ’s worthiness .	0	psychology
 For example , a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car ’s safety features and fuel economy .	0	psychology
 4017 . Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people .	0	psychology
 In one study , a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4020 . The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment . What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure ?	1	psychology
 Research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another dissenter , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity .	0	psychology
 4023 . In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .	1	psychology
 However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .	1	psychology
 What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?	0	psychology
 4026 . Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience .	0	psychology
 When certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks ( Milgram , 1965 ) .	0	psychology
 4029 . Sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance .	0	psychology
 Social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone .	1	psychology
 This typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled .	0	psychology
 4032 . The field of I - O psychology can be divided into three broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors .	0	psychology
 Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements .	1	psychology
 In addition , once employees are hired , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train , evaluate , and respond to those evaluations .	0	psychology
 4035 . Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising , management , and personnel selection .	0	psychology
 In 1903 , Scott published two books : The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising .	0	psychology
 4038 . Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing .	0	psychology
 Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers .	0	psychology
 In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled , The Principles of Scientific Management ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4041 . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different .	0	psychology
 Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group .	0	psychology
 4044 . Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos , Native Americans , European Americans ) .	1	psychology
 What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups ?	0	psychology
 4047 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .	1	psychology
 Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4050 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .	0	psychology
 A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .	1	psychology
 4053 . These groups serve as our in - groups .	0	psychology
 An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .	1	psychology
 A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .	1	psychology
 4056 . This often happens by blaming an out - group for the problem .	0	psychology
 Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out - group when the in - group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .	1	psychology
 4059 . Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .	1	psychology
 In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .	1	psychology
 4062 . Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying ( APA , 2010 ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied ( Olweus , 1993 ) :	0	psychology
 4065 . Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .	0	psychology
 The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .	1	psychology
 Instead , they just watch what is happening .	0	psychology
 4068 . Research suggests there are many other reasons .	0	psychology
 Altruism is people ’s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .	1	psychology
 In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4071 . Once we form relationships with people , we desire reciprocity .	0	psychology
 Reciprocity is the give and take in relationships .	1	psychology
 We contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well .	0	psychology
 4074 . Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages .	0	psychology
 4077 . One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory .	0	psychology
 According to social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( Rusbult & Van Lange , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 4080 . You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview .	0	psychology
 As you can imagine , most research is concerned with the employer ’s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too .	0	psychology
 4083 . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin : An employer can not discriminate based on skin color , hair texture , or other immutable characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in hiring , benefits , promotions , or termination of employees .	1	psychology
 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights Act ; it prohibits job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and termination ) discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required .	1	psychology
 4086 . Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology .	0	psychology
 In organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization .	1	psychology
 In this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different styles of management , different styles of leadership , organizational culture , and teamwork .	0	psychology
 4089 . Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business ’s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees .	1	psychology
 Industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those staying ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation packages ) , and how retained employees are supported .	0	psychology
 4092 . A significant portion of I - O research focuses on management and human relations .	0	psychology
 Douglas McGregor ( 1960 ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior .	1	psychology
 His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .	0	psychology
 4095 . Bass ( 1985 ) popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles .	0	psychology
 In transactional leadership , the focus is on supervision and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments ( i.e. , transactions ) .	1	psychology
 Transactional leaders maintain the status quo : They are managers .	1	psychology
 4098 . Each company and organization has an organizational culture .	0	psychology
 Organizational culture encompasses the values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its employees .	1	psychology
 It is how an organization is run , how it operates , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence .	0	psychology
 4101 . The U.S .	0	psychology
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( n.d . ) provides the following description of sexual harassment :	0	psychology
 4104 . Whereas the two other areas of I - O psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work station , information displays , and the local environment , such as lighting .	1	psychology
 In the United States , human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering ; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth ( psychologist and engineer ) and her husband Frank Gilbreth ( engineer ) .	0	psychology
 4107 . These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .	0	psychology
 For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .	1	psychology
 Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .	0	psychology
 4110 . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .	0	psychology
 A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail .	1	psychology
 A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .	0	psychology
 4113 . A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .	0	psychology
 But when stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating , or what Selye termed distress ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .	1	psychology
 People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .	0	psychology
 4116 . Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .	0	psychology
 Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4119 . The general adaptation syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of three stages : ( 1 ) alarm reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of exhaustion ( Selye , 1936 ; 1976 ) .	0	psychology
 Alarm reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon .	1	psychology
 During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .	0	psychology
 4122 . What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?	0	psychology
 The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis .	0	psychology
 When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .	0	psychology
 4125 . The sociocultural perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background .	1	psychology
 For example , José is an 18-year - old Hispanic male from a traditional family .	0	psychology
 4128 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .	0	psychology
 They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	0	psychology
 4131 . Potential stressors do not always involve major life events .	0	psychology
 Daily hassles — the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , rush hour traffic , lost keys , obnoxious coworkers , inclement weather , arguments with friends or family)—can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( Kanner , Coyne , Schaefer , & Lazarus , 1981 ) .	0	psychology
 4134 . This helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high .	0	psychology
 About 40%–60 % of individuals relapse , which means they return to abusing drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement ( National Institute on Drug Abuse [ NIDA ] , 2008 ) .	1	psychology
 4137 . In this section , we will discuss stress and illness .	0	psychology
 As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky ( 1998 ) describes ,	0	psychology
 4140 . In addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job .	0	psychology
 This situation is referred to as immunosuppression , the decreased effectiveness of the immune system .	1	psychology
 When people experience immunosuppression , they become susceptible to any number of infections , illness , and diseases .	0	psychology
 4143 . Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division , which includes growth and proliferation of new cells , thereby leading to more rapid aging ( Sapolsky , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 In the study , researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children ( Epel et al . , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children .	0	psychology
 4146 . These individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush .	1	psychology
 According to Friedman and Rosenman , these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern ; those who are more relaxed and laid - back were characterized as Type B ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In a sample of Type As and Type Bs , Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs ( Friedman & Rosenman , 1959 ) .	0	psychology
 4149 . Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .	1	psychology
 A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic - depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .	0	psychology
 4152 . The therapist informs the client about confidentiality , fees , and what to expect in treatment .	0	psychology
 Confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so .	1	psychology
 During the intake , the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals .	0	psychology
 4155 . Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The couple may be dating , partnered , engaged , or married .	0	psychology
 4158 . In strategic family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time .	1	psychology
 Typically , the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member ’s problem ( Madanes , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 4161 . Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century , but it has since waned significantly in popularity .	0	psychology
 4164 . Freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — maybe positive feelings , maybe negative feelings .	0	psychology
 Freud called this transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the psychoanalyst .	1	psychology
 For example , Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst .	0	psychology
 4167 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .	1	psychology
 In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .	1	psychology
 4170 . Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .	0	psychology
 Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior .	1	psychology
 Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors , such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking .	0	psychology
 4173 . Sometimes , it ’s too impractical , expensive , or embarrassing to re - create anxiety- producing situations , so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears .	0	psychology
 Virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a trauma and stressor - related disorder ( Gerardi , Cukor , Difede , Rizzo , & Rothbaum , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 4176 . Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s .	0	psychology
 His initial focus was on depression and how a client ’s self - defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( Beck , Rush , Shaw , & Emery , 1979 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4179 . Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential .	1	psychology
 So it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self - aware and accepting of themselves .	0	psychology
 In contrast to psychoanalysis , humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts .	0	psychology
 4182 . In active listening , the therapist acknowledges , restates , and clarifies what the client expresses .	0	psychology
 Therapists also practice what Rogers called unconditional positive regard , which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are .	1	psychology
 Rogers ( 1951 ) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness , empathy , and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves , which results in personal growth .	0	psychology
 4185 . As we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is chronic — takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications .	0	psychology
 When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .	0	psychology
 4188 . These efforts may include avoiding , minimizing , or distancing oneself from the problem , or positive comparisons with others ( “ I ’m not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ Now that I ’ve been fired , I can sleep in for a few days ” ) .	0	psychology
 In some cases , emotion - focused coping strategies involve reappraisal , whereby the stressor is construed differently ( and somewhat self - deceptively ) without changing its objective level of threat ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks , “ This will give me a great chance to network with others , ” is using reappraisal .	0	psychology
 4191 . Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear .	0	psychology
 Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) .	0	psychology
 4194 . Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks , there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( Salmon , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 It is well - established that exercise , both of long ( aerobic ) and short ( anaerobic ) duration , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4197 . The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( Benson & Proctor , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s .	0	psychology
 Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals .	1	psychology
 4200 . Measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do .	0	psychology
 Studies show that average national happiness scores ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to six key variables : per capita gross domestic product ( GDP , which reflects a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life expectancy , freedom from perceived corruption in government and business , and generosity ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4203 . Qualities that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - lasting , or trait - like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4206 . By the 18th century , people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders .	1	psychology
 Often these people were kept in windowless dungeons , beaten , chained to their beds , and had little to no contact with caregivers .	0	psychology
 4209 . This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States .	0	psychology
 It started the process of deinstitutionalization , the closing of large asylums , by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally .	1	psychology
 In 1955 , there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals ( Torrey , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 4212 . However , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are diagnosed early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school .	0	psychology
 These conditions are listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , academic , and intellectual functioning ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 In this section , we will discuss two such disorders : attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism .	0	psychology
 4215 . The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder ; individuals diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary , but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication , such as talking only about their special interests ( Wing , Gould , & Gillberg , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 However , because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger ’s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder , the DSM-5 does not include it , which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ Asperger ’s Syndrome Dropped , ” 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work independently as adults .	0	psychology
 607 . The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single - stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide ( dNTP ) , which is a monomer , or a single unit , of DNA .	0	biology
 The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides ( ddNTPs ) .	0	biology
 The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group ( –OH ) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 610 . This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes .	0	biology
 However , the desire to sequence larger genomes , such as that of a human , led to the development of double - barrel shotgun sequencing , more formally known as pairwise - end sequencing .	0	biology
 In pairwise - end sequencing , both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap .	1	biology
 613 . Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms .	0	biology
 The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation .	1	biology
 Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology , such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets .	0	biology
 616 . Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction , not all mRNAs are translated into proteins .	0	biology
 The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics .	1	biology
 Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes .	0	biology
 622 . Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries .	0	biology
 Most of the common diseases , such as heart disease , are multi - factored or polygenic , which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes , and also involve environmental factors such as diet .	1	biology
 In April 2010 , scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual ( Stephen Quake , a scientist at Stanford University , who had his genome sequenced ) ; the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases .	0	biology
 628 . A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation .	1	biology
 Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “ fit ” of the population to its environment .	0	biology
 631 . Over time , evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species , but they have maintained the same overall layout .	1	biology
 Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures .	0	biology
 637 . A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile , viable offspring .	1	biology
 According to this definition , one species is distinguished from another when , in nature , it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring .	0	biology
 640 . Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories .	0	biology
" Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution ."	1	biology
" Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location ."	1	biology
 643 . Over time , the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species .	1	biology
 This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin ; thus , causing the species to radiate into several new ones .	0	biology
 Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms .	0	biology
 646 . Given enough time , the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together , mating would be less likely , but if mating occurred , offspring would be non - viable or infertile .	0	biology
 Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation , the ability to interbreed , of the two populations .	1	biology
 649 . Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year , often just annually .	0	biology
 Differences in breeding schedules , called temporal isolation , can act as a form of reproductive isolation .	1	biology
 For example , two species of frogs inhabit the same area , but one reproduces from January to March , whereas the other reproduces from March to May ( [ link]).These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation .	0	biology
 652 . Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells ( eggs and sperm ) prevent fertilization from taking place ; this is called a gametic barrier .	1	biology
 Similarly , in some cases closely related organisms try to mate , but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together .	0	biology
 655 . In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .	1	biology
 The theory also connects this change of a population over time , called microevolution , with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters , called macroevolution .	1	biology
 658 . Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way , meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele , while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool .	0	biology
 The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population .	1	biology
 661 . Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic .	1	biology
 The distribution of phenotypes among individuals , known as the population variation , is influenced by a number of factors , including the population ’s genetic structure and the environment ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures .	0	biology
 664 . When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .	0	biology
 This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding , the mating of closely related individuals , which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease .	1	biology
 For example , a disease that is caused by a rare , recessive allele might exist in a population , but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele .	0	biology
 667 . Another way a population ’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift ( [ link ] ) , which is simply the effect of chance .	0	biology
 By chance , some individuals will have more offspring than others — not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically - encoded trait , but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time ( when the receptive female walked by ) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ( when a fox was hunting ) .	1	biology
 670 . If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers , the result can be a changing population .	0	biology
 There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs .	0	biology
 One reason is simple mate choice ; for example , female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger , brighter tails .	0	biology
 673 . Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .	0	biology
 One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .	1	biology
 Species of warm - blooded animals , for example , tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth ’s poles , allowing them to better conserve heat .	0	biology
 676 . However , it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts , but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population .	1	biology
 This concept , called relative fitness , allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation , and thus , how the population might evolve .	0	biology
 679 . Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection , while the intermediate phenotypes are , on average , less fit .	1	biology
 Known as diversifying selection ( [ link ] ) , this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms .	0	biology
 Large , dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force , while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male ’s territory .	0	biology
 682 . The speculation is that large tails carry risk , and only the best males survive that risk : the bigger the tail , the more fit the male .	0	biology
 This idea is known as the handicap principle .	0	biology
 685 . In scientific terms , the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny .	1	biology
 A phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism , such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved , to which species it is most closely related , and so forth .	0	biology
 688 . In a rooted tree , the branching indicates evolutionary relationships ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .	1	biology
 A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 691 . When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .	1	biology
 It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor , it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other .	0	biology
 694 . For example , after the common beginning of all life , scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya .	1	biology
 Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .	1	biology
 After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 697 . Therefore , the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus .	0	biology
 The name at each level is also called a taxon .	1	biology
 In other words , dogs are in order Carnivora .	0	biology
 700 . How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees ?	0	biology
 After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted , scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics .	0	biology
 This system sorts organisms into clades : groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor .	1	biology
 703 . Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure .	0	biology
 Only some of the organisms in [ link ] have this trait , and to those that do , it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree . The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative .	1	biology
 The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used .	0	biology
 706 . More recently , a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered .	0	biology
 Small , virus - like particles called gene transfer agents ( GTAs ) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another .	1	biology
 GTAs have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes , sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes .	0	biology
 709 . The nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .	1	biology
 The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .	1	biology
 712 . Others have proposed abandoning any tree - like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure , the so - called “ ring of life ” ( [ link ] ) ; a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes .	1	biology
 Lake , again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm , proposes a ring - like model in which species of all three domains — Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya — evolved from a single pool of gene - swapping prokaryotes .	1	biology
 715 . They therefore lack most of the components of cells , such as organelles , ribosomes , and the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 A virion consists of a nucleic acid core , an outer protein coating or capsid , and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell .	1	biology
 Viruses may also contain additional proteins , such as enzymes .	0	biology
 718 . Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 For these viruses , attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane , so they can complete their replication inside the cell .	0	biology
 721 . Group I viruses contain double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) as their genome .	0	biology
 Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .	0	biology
 724 . The strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .	0	biology
 Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .	0	biology
 Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .	0	biology
 727 . Multiple , full - length RNA strands of negative polarity ( complimentary to the positive - stranded genomic RNA ) are formed from these intermediates , which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity , including both full - length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs .	0	biology
 Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity , meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA .	0	biology
 As with Group IV viruses , dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA .	0	biology
 730 . Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host .	0	biology
 Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive .	1	biology
 For most viruses , the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach .	0	biology
 733 . The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .	0	biology
 Many animal viruses , such as HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding , where virions leave the cell individually .	1	biology
 During the budding process , the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed .	0	biology
 736 . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	1	biology
 If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 739 . For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .	1	biology
 When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .	1	biology
 An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ ( lambda ) virus , which also infects the E .	0	biology
 742 . As you will learn in the next module , animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases .	0	biology
 Some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease , where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection .	1	biology
 Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .	0	biology
 745 . Some animal - infecting viruses , including the hepatitis C virus discussed above , are known as oncogenic viruses : They have the ability to cause cancer .	1	biology
 These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth ( oncogenes ) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth .	1	biology

 3147 . Einstein realized that there were several characteristics of the photoelectric effect that could be explained only if EM radiation is itself quantized : the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is actually composed of energy quanta called photons .	0	physics
 In his explanation of the photoelectric effect , Einstein defined a quantized unit or quantum of EM energy , which we now call a photon , with an energy proportional to the frequency of EM radiation .	1	physics
" In equation form , the photon energy isE = hf , E = hf , size 12{E = ital "" hf "" } { } where EE size 12{E } { } is the energy of a photon of frequency ff size 12{f } { } and hh size 12{h } { } is Planck ’s constant ."	0	physics

 IR can be absorbed and emitted by atoms and molecules , particularly between closely spaced states .	0	physics
 3156 . There is also no doubt that it behaves as particles — photons with discrete energy .	0	physics
 We call this twofold nature the particle - wave duality , meaning that EM radiation has both particle and wave properties .	1	physics

 This is called atomic excitation .	0	physics
 Once it is excited , the atom can de - excite in several ways , one of which is to re - emit a photon of the same energy as excited it , a single step back to the ground state .	0	physics
 3177 . These energy levels are inhibited and are slow in de - exciting because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower levels .	0	physics
 Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms , they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and , thus , are said to be metastable , meaning relatively stable .	0	physics
 Phosphorescence is the de - excitation of a metastable state .	1	physics

 Stimulated emission is the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons of a given frequency , triggered by photons of the same frequency .	1	physics
 For example , an excited atom , with an electron in an energy orbit higher than normal , releases a photon of a specific frequency when the electron drops back to a lower energy orbit .	0	physics
 3183 . The name hologram means “ entire picture ” ( from the Greek holo , as in holistic ) , because the image is three - dimensional .	0	physics
 Holography is the process of producing holograms and , although they are recorded on photographic film , the process is quite different from normal photography .	1	physics
 Holography uses light interference or wave optics , whereas normal photography uses geometric optics .	0	physics

 3216 . Experiments have shown that the more energetic the αα size 12{α } { } decay of a particular nuclide is , the shorter is its half - life .	0	physics
 Tunneling explains this in the following manner : For the decay to be more energetic , the nucleons must have more energy in the nucleus and should be able to ascend a little closer to the rim .	0	physics
 The barrier is therefore not as thick for more energetic decay , and the exponential decrease of the wave function inside the barrier is not as great .	0	physics

 Like angiosperms , they have broad leaves .	0	biology
 913 . Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .	0	biology
 Sepals and petals together form the perianth .	1	biology
 The sexual organs ( carpels and stamens ) are located at the center of the flower .	1	biology
 919 . Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .	1	biology
 925 . Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support , especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic .	0	biology
 Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory , or consumption of plants by insects and other animals .	0	biology
 This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination .	0	biology
 931 . In seed plants , the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation , and at the same time , a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte : from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte .	0	biology
 Whereas lower vascular plants , such as club mosses and ferns , are mostly homosporous ( produce only one type of spore ) , all seed plants , or spermatophytes , are heterosporous .	1	biology

 964 . The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes ( including chordates and echinoderms ) and two distinct clades of protostomes ( including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans ) ( [ link]ab ) .	0	biology
 Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	0	biology
 967 . While the validity of this claim is still under investigation , these primitive fossils appear to be small , one - centimeter long , sponge - like creatures .	0	biology
 These fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years , actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 Until this discovery , most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period .	0	biology
 973 . Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .	0	biology
 Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum .	1	biology
 However , sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms , including variations in the size of the spongocoel , the number of osculi , and where the cells that filter food from the water are located .	0	biology
 976 . The gel - like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges .	0	biology
 In addition to the osculum , sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge .	1	biology
 In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 979 . In some sponges , sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl , which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica , depending on the type of sponge .	0	biology
 These spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge .	0	biology
 982 . Cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes ( “ stinging cells ” ) containing organelles called nematocysts ( stingers ) .	0	biology
 These cells are present around the mouth and tentacles , and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells .	1	biology
 985 . The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .	1	biology
 Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .	0	biology
 In terms of cellular complexity , cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer , such as nerve cells , contractile epithelial cells , enzyme - secreting cells , and nutrient - absorbing cells , as well as the presence of intercellular connections .	0	biology

 991 . The rotifers are a microscopic ( about 100 µm to 30 mm ) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona , a rotating , wheel - like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Although their taxonomy is currently in flux , one treatment places the rotifers in three classes : Bdelloidea , Monogononta , and Seisonidea .	0	biology
 994 . A unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel .	0	biology
 The proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species .	1	biology
 997 . Phylum Mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments .	0	biology
 It is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks ; there are over 75,000 described species , making them the second most diverse phylum of animals .	0	biology
 1000 . Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally , although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks , such as snails and slugs , or in cephalopods .	0	biology
 In some mollusks , the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages — trochophore and veliger — before becoming a young adult ; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage , glochidia .	0	biology
 1003 . These animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Shells may be planospiral ( like a garden hose wound up ) , commonly seen in garden snails , or conispiral , ( like a spiral staircase ) , commonly seen in marine conches .	0	biology
 1006 . The phylum includes earthworms , polychaete worms , and leeches .	0	biology
 Annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called “ segmented worms ” due to their key characteristic of metamerism , or true segmentation .	1	biology
 1009 . The number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in Oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes ( poly = many , chaetae = hairs ) .	0	biology
 The many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy , flat , paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia , which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates .	1	biology
 The subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as Hirudo medicinalis and Hemiclepsis marginata .	0	biology
 1012 . Tagma may be in the form of a head , thorax , and abdomen , or a cephalothorax and abdomen , or a head and trunk .	0	biology
 A central cavity , called the hemocoel ( or blood cavity ) , is present , and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single - chambered heart .	0	biology
 Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod : insects and myriapods use a series of tubes ( tracheae ) that branch through the body , open to the outside through openings called spiracles , and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae , whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills , terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs , and aquatic chelicerates use book gills ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1015 . Most crustaceans are dioecious , which means that the sexes are separate .	1	biology
 Some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites .	0	biology
 Serial hermaphroditism , where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova , may also be seen in some species .	1	biology
 1018 . A “ head ” tagmum is not usually discernible .	0	biology
 The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages : the chelicerae ( [ link ] ) , which are specialized , claw - like or fang - like mouthparts .	1	biology
 These animals do not possess antennae .	0	biology
 1021 . There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes , including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo .	0	biology
 In deuterostomes , internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom .	1	biology
 The endodermal lining of the archenteron ( or the primitive gut ) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer .	0	biology
 1024 . These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum .	0	biology
 These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system .	0	biology

 1027 . Characteristics of ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In some groups , some of these are present only during embryonic development .	0	biology
 1030 . Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx ( the region just posterior to the mouth ) that extend to the outside environment .	1	biology
 In organisms that live in aquatic environments , pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding .	0	biology
 1033 . Members of Urochordata are also known as tunicates ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The name tunicate derives from the cellulose - like carbohydrate material , called the tunic , which covers the outer body of tunicates .	0	biology

 Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world , except for the polar regions .	0	biology
 1045 . Gnathostomes or “ jaw - mouths ” are vertebrates that possess jaws .	1	biology
 One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw , which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food .	1	biology
 1048 . Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .	0	biology
 Sharks , together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians , also have a sense organ called the lateral line , which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water , and is often considered homologous to “ hearing ” in terrestrial vertebrates .	1	biology
 The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish ’s body .	0	biology
 1051 . Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .	1	biology
 Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .	1	biology

 1060 . Extra - embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo .	1	biology
 While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself , the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac .	1	biology
 The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg ’s external environment .	0	biology
 1063 . The initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids .	0	biology
 Synapsids include all mammals , including extinct mammalian species .	0	biology
 Synapsids also include therapsids , which were mammal - like reptiles from which mammals evolved .	0	biology
 1066 . Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .	1	biology
 Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .	1	biology
 Anapsids include extinct organisms and may , based on anatomy , include turtles .	0	biology
 1069 . In cold weather , some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate .	0	biology
 Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating , but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves .	1	biology
 Rather , their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures , and the animal is very sluggish .	0	biology

 Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell .	0	biology
 1078 . Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .	0	biology
 Eccrine glands produce sweat , or perspiration , which is mainly composed of water .	1	biology
 In most mammals , eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body , and some mammals do not possess them at all .	0	biology
 1081 . The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features .	0	biology
 The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone , the dentary .	0	biology
 The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone .	0	biology
 1084 . There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .	0	biology
 The leathery - beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology

 Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother , allowing for gas , fluid , and nutrient exchange .	1	biology
 While other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta , all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation .	0	biology
 1090 . Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .	0	biology
 Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust .	1	biology
 Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 1093 . The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates , which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings .	0	biology
 Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles ( collarbones ) , forming the furcula or wishbone .	1	biology
 The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping .	0	biology
 1096 . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .	0	biology
 This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds .	0	biology

 The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes ; they have low sexual dimorphism ( that is , the sexes are not markedly different in size ) ; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees . The ( a ) chimpanzee is one of the great apes .	1	biology
 1111 . Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago .	1	biology
 This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) .	0	biology
 1114 . Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems : a shoot system , and a root system .	0	biology
 The shoot system consists of two portions : the vegetative ( non - reproductive ) parts of the plant , such as the leaves and the stems , and the reproductive parts of the plant , which include flowers and fruits .	1	biology
 The shoot system generally grows above ground , where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis .	0	biology
 1117 . Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .	1	biology
 Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1120 . Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .	1	biology
 Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 1123 . Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .	1	biology
 Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .	1	biology
 1126 . Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .	1	biology
 The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .	1	biology
 The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 1129 . Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 They are found in the stem , the root , the inside of the leaf , and the pulp of the fruit .	0	biology
 1132 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 1135 . Two cells , known as guard cells , surround each leaf stoma , controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	0	biology
 1138 . Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .	1	biology
 Vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls ; they are shorter than tracheids .	1	biology
 Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element .	0	biology
 1141 . Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells , but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem .	0	biology
 The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith , while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex .	1	biology
 1144 . The cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm , which grows inward from the cambium .	0	biology
 The cork cambium , cork cells , and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm .	1	biology
 The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 1147 . Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .	0	biology
 Corms are similar to rhizomes , except they are more rounded and fleshy ( such as in gladiolus ) .	0	biology
 Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	0	biology
 1150 . Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp . ) .	1	biology
 Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	0	biology
 1153 . Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .	1	biology
 Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .	1	biology
 1156 . A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil .	0	biology
 In contrast , a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface , and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion ( lawn grasses are a good example , as are wheat , rice , and corn ) .	1	biology
 Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots .	0	biology
 1159 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 1162 . This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .	0	biology
 The outermost cell layer of the root ’s vascular tissue is the pericycle , an area that can give rise to lateral roots .	1	biology
 In dicot roots , the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape , whereas in monocot roots , the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith .	1	biology
 1165 . Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 1168 . The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy .	1	biology
 The number and placement of a plant ’s leaves will vary depending on the species , with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement .	0	biology
 1171 . In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .	1	biology
 In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .	1	biology
 Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology
 1174 . The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick ; however , in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions , the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration .	0	biology
 A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species .	1	biology
 The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface .	0	biology
 1177 . Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface .	1	biology
 It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem .	0	biology
 1180 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	1	biology
 1183 . Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low - molecular - weight sugars using only carbon dioxide , light , and water .	0	biology
 Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light .	1	biology
 It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space .	0	biology
 1186 . The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants ; it can be crucial for competition and survival .	0	biology
 The response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors , which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light - absorbing pigment called a chromophore .	1	biology
 Together , the two are called a chromoprotein .	0	biology
 1189 . Most activation occurs on the lit side , causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid ( IAA ) to accumulate on the shaded side .	0	biology
 Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.Cryptochromes are another class of blue - light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin - based chromophore .	1	biology
 Cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle , also know as its circadian rhythem , using blue light cues .	1	biology
" 1192 . The term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein , which means "" to grow . """	0	biology
 Auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism .	1	biology
 They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue , and promote leaf development and arrangement .	0	biology
 1195 . Gibberellins ( GAs ) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation , seed germination , and fruit and flower maturation .	1	biology
 GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems , young leaves , and seed embryos .	0	biology
 1198 . Jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory .	0	biology
 Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator , resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites .	0	biology
 1201 . The movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism , from the Greek words thigma meaning “ touch , ” and tropism implying “ direction . ” Tendrils are one example of this .	1	biology
 The meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive ; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response .	0	biology
 1204 . Plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds .	0	biology
 An organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon , such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants .	0	biology
 1207 . The essential elements can be divided into two groups : macronutrients and micronutrients .	0	biology
 Nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients .	1	biology
 About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients : carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium and sulfur .	0	biology
 3919 . Try this fun activity that employs a memory - enhancing strategy . You could also enhance memory by using elaborative rehearsal : a technique in which you think about the meaning of the new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory ( Tigner , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , in this case , you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and the person you met is from Arizona .	0	psychology
 3925 . Across these three domains — physical , cognitive , and psychosocial — the normative approach to development is also discussed .	0	psychology
 This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .	0	psychology
 3928 . Continuous development views development as a cumulative process , gradually improving on existing skills ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 With this type of development , there is gradual change .	0	psychology
 3931 . In the field of behavioral genetics , the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart — a well - known study of the genetic basis for personality — conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999 .	1	psychology
 In studying 350 pairs of twins , including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart , researchers found that identical twins , whether raised together or apart , have very similar personalities ( Bouchard , 1994 ; Bouchard , Lykken , McGue , Segal , & Tellegen , 1990 ; Segal , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3934 . Sigmund Freud ( 1856–1939 ) believed that personality develops during early childhood .	0	psychology
 For Freud , childhood experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults .	0	psychology
 3937 . Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .	0	psychology
 Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .	1	psychology
 While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood , Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan .	0	psychology
 3943 . Young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are edible , and once they can grasp objects , they may shake or bang them to see if they make sounds .	0	psychology
 Between 5 and 8 months old , the child develops object permanence , which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight , it still exists ( Bogartz , Shinskey , & Schilling , 2000 ) .	1	psychology
 According to Piaget , young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight .	0	psychology
 3946 . During this stage , we also expect children to display egocentrism , which means that the child is not able to take the perspective of others .	1	psychology
 A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees , thinks , and feels just as they do .	0	psychology
 3949 . The fourth , and last , stage in Piaget ’s theory is the formal operational stage , which is from about age 11 to adulthood .	0	psychology
 Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete events , children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations .	1	psychology
 3955 . Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or behavior over others .	0	psychology
 Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .	1	psychology
 In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .	1	psychology
 3958 . They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables , and thus to the person ’s state .	1	psychology
 This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error ( Ross , 1977 ; Riggio & Garcia , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 To better understand , imagine this scenario : Greg returns home from work , and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day .	0	psychology
 3961 . You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation .	0	psychology
 The actor - observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) .	1	psychology
 As actors of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior .	0	psychology
 3964 . A common ideology , or worldview , in the United States is the just - world hypothesis .	0	psychology
 The just - world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve ( Lerner & Miller , 1978 ) .	1	psychology
 In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( Jost , Banaji , & Nosek , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 3967 . Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .	1	psychology
 The genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this point .	0	psychology
 3970 . Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .	0	psychology
 The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord .	1	psychology
 Basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head , chest , and abdomen .	0	psychology
 3973 . Each organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy , called the critical or sensitive period ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 For example , research with primate models of FASD has demonstrated that the time during which a developing fetus is exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome .	0	psychology
 3976 . Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .	1	psychology
 Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .	1	psychology
 3979 . He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child ( 1988 ) .	0	psychology
 A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings .	1	psychology
 Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment : The caregiver must be responsive to the child ’s physical , social , and emotional needs ; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions ( Bowlby , 1969 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3982 . In cases of resistant attachment , children tend to show clingy behavior , but then they reject the attachment figure ’s attempts to interact with them ( Ainsworth & Bell , 1970 ) .	1	psychology
 These children do not explore the toys in the room , as they are too fearful .	0	psychology
 3985 . In authoritarian style , the parent places high value on conformity and obedience .	1	psychology
 The parents are often strict , tightly monitor their children , and express little warmth .	0	psychology
 3988 . As you can see , parenting styles influence childhood adjustment , but could a child ’s temperament likewise influence parenting ?	0	psychology
 Temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks , behaves , and reacts with the environment .	1	psychology
 Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions , adapt well to change , and are capable of regulating their emotions .	0	psychology
 3991 . Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .	0	psychology
 Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .	1	psychology
 Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 3994 . Cognitive empathy , also known as theory - of - mind ( which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism ) , relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others ( Shamay - Tsoory , Tomer , & Aharon - Peretz , 2005 ) .	1	psychology
 Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance .	0	psychology
 3997 . In contrast , until about 50 years ago in the United States , a doctor might not inform someone that they were dying , and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals .	0	psychology
 In 1967 that reality began to change with Cicely Saunders , who created the first modern hospice in England .	0	psychology
 The aim of hospice is to help provide a death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment , which is usually outside of a hospital setting .	1	psychology

 4006 . Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self - esteem or positive self - image .	0	psychology
 Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) .	1	psychology
 Festinger ’s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self - perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) .	1	psychology
 4009 . Besides the classic military example and group initiation , can you think of other examples of cognitive dissonance ?	0	psychology
 Here is one : Marco and Maria live in Fairfield County , Connecticut , which is one of the wealthiest areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living .	0	psychology
 4012 . After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .	0	psychology
 Out of this work came a model called the Yale attitude change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes .	0	psychology
 Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message , the content of the message , and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message ( Hovland , Janis , & Kelley , 1953 ) .	0	psychology
 4015 . The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .	1	psychology
 Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement .	0	psychology
 4018 . The remaining members of the group were confederates of the researcher .	0	psychology
 A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher .	1	psychology
 Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design , and the true , naïve participants believe that confederates are , like them , uninformed participants in the experiment .	0	psychology
 4021 . The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not coerced by others ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The Asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something .	0	psychology
 For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority .	0	psychology
 4024 . Another form of social influence is obedience to authority .	0	psychology
 Obedience is the change of an individual ’s behavior to comply with a demand by an authority figure .	1	psychology
 People often comply with the request because they are concerned about a consequence if they do not comply .	0	psychology
 4027 . Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink .	0	psychology
 Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus ( Janis , 1972 ) .	1	psychology
 In group situations , the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do .	0	psychology
 4030 . Social LoafingAnother way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing .	0	psychology
 Social loafing is the exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group .	1	psychology

 4042 . How did your prejudice develop ?	0	psychology
 Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics .	1	psychology
 Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group .	0	psychology
 4045 . Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex .	1	psychology
 Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex .	0	psychology
 4048 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .	1	psychology
 Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 Negative feelings often result in discrimination , such as the exclusion of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people from social groups and the avoidance of LGBT neighbors and co - workers .	0	psychology
 4051 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .	0	psychology
 A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .	1	psychology
 When we hold stereotypes about a person , we tend to treat the person according to our expectations .	0	psychology
 4054 . An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .	1	psychology
 A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .	1	psychology
 For example , if you are female , your gender in - group includes all females , and your gender out - group includes all males ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4057 . Humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person .	0	psychology
 Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .	1	psychology
 4060 . For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person .	0	psychology
 Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) .	0	psychology
 This theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal , they become frustrated and aggressive .	1	psychology
 4063 . With the rapid growth of technology , and widely available mobile technology and social networking media , a new form of bullying has emerged : cyberbullying ( Hoff & Mitchell , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 Cyberbullying , like bullying , is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional harm to another person .	1	psychology
 What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert , concealed , done in private , and the bully can remain anonymous .	0	psychology
 4066 . Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation .	0	psychology
 Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police .	0	psychology
 4069 . Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy .	0	psychology
 Empathy is the capacity to understand another person ’s perspective , to feel what he or she feels .	1	psychology
 An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help ( Batson , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 4072 . Self - disclosure is part of the two way street .	0	psychology
 Self - disclosure is the sharing of personal information ( Laurenceau , Barrett , & Pietromonaco , 1998 ) .	1	psychology

 4090 . Many people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of their home life , whether it be caring for children or taking care of an elderly parent ; this is known as work - family balance .	1	psychology
 We might commonly think about work interfering with family , but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with work obligations ( Carlson , Kacmar , & Williams , 2000 ) .	0	psychology
 4093 . His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .	0	psychology
 In the Theory X approach to management , managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self - directed .	1	psychology
 Theory X managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks to perform and when .	0	psychology
 4096 . This is in contrast to the transformational leader .	0	psychology
 People who have transformational leadership possess four attributes to varying degrees : They are charismatic ( highly liked role models ) , inspirational ( optimistic about goal attainment ) , intellectually stimulating ( encourage critical thinking and problem solving ) , and considerate ( Bass , Avolio , & Atwater , 1996 ) .	1	psychology

 4108 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	1	psychology
 A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .	0	psychology
 4111 . The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal : judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be ( Lyon , 2012 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 As you may recall from what you learned about self - efficacy , an individual ’s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( Bandura , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 4117 . Selye and the General Adaptation SyndromeAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye , mentioned earlier .	0	psychology
 He would eventually become one of the world ’s foremost experts in the study of stress ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4120 . If exposure to a stressor is prolonged , the organism will enter the stage of resistance .	0	psychology
 During this stage , the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor .	1	psychology
 4123 . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body .	0	psychology
 Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight .	1	psychology
 However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .	0	psychology
 4126 . As our society becomes increasingly multiethnic and multiracial , mental health professionals must develop cultural competence ( [ link ] ) , which means they must understand and address issues of race , culture , and ethnicity .	1	psychology
 They must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application ( Sue , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 4129 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .	0	psychology
 They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	1	psychology
 Many life events that most people would consider pleasant ( e.g. , holidays , retirement , marriage ) are among those listed on the SRRS ; these are examples of eustress .	0	psychology
 4132 . Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job .	0	psychology
 Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) .	1	psychology
 Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in [ link ] involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e.g. , inability to decide when to take breaks ) .	0	psychology
 4135 . Frequently , a person who is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol has an additional psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Saying a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses .	1	psychology
 This can often be a substance - related diagnosis and another psychiatric diagnosis , such as depression , bipolar disorder , or schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 4138 . Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional factors are called psychophysiological disorders .	1	psychology
 The physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors ( hence the psycho and physiological in psychophysiological ) .	0	psychology
 4141 . The question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated researchers for over three decades , and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of health psychology ( Kiecolt - Glaser , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning .	1	psychology
 The term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981 , when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain , endocrine system , and immune system ( Zacharie , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 4144 . The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system .	1	psychology
 For many years , disorders that involve the cardiovascular system — known as cardiovascular disorders — have been a major focal point in the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system ’s centrality in the stress response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	1	psychology
 Heart disease is one such condition .	0	psychology
 4147 . Also , one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical students from 32 to 48 years .	0	psychology
 At the beginning of the study , these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure ; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger , whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger .	0	psychology
 Decades later , researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55 , and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age ( Chang , Ford , Meoni , Wang , & Klag , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4150 . Asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed , leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs .	1	psychology
 The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways ( leading to thickening of the airway walls ) and a tightening of the muscles around them , resulting in a narrowing of the airways ( [ link ] ) ( American Lung Association , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 4156 . Family therapy is a special form of group therapy , consisting of one or more families .	1	psychology
 Although there are many theoretical orientations in family therapy , one of the most predominant is the systems approach .	0	psychology
 4159 . Both types of treatment help people with psychological disorders , such as depression , anxiety , and schizophrenia .	0	psychology
 Psychotherapy is a psychological treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems , or to attain personal growth .	1	psychology
 In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .	0	psychology
 4162 . In a psychoanalyst ’s office , you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories , and the therapist using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In free association , the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment .	1	psychology
 However , Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block , or repress , unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association .	0	psychology
 4165 . Today , Freud ’s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies : the psychodynamic perspective .	0	psychology
 This approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people ’s internal drives and forces , but treatment is less intensive than Freud ’s original model .	0	psychology
 4168 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .	1	psychology
 In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .	1	psychology
 Therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors , like phobias and bedwetting , can be changed by teaching clients new , more constructive behaviors .	0	psychology
 4171 . In exposure therapy , a therapist seeks to treat clients’ fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem , with the idea that they will eventually get used to it .	1	psychology
 This can be done via reality , imagination , or virtual reality .	0	psychology
 4174 . One popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy .	0	psychology
 This involves a controlled setting where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens , such as a poker chip , that can be exchanged for items or privileges .	1	psychology
 4177 . PSYCHOTHERAPY : COGNITIVE - BEHAVIORAL THERAPYCognitive - behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient ’s childhood or past , as in other forms of psychotherapy .	1	psychology
 One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .	1	psychology
 Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009).Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .	1	psychology
 4180 . Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian , or client - centered therapy .	0	psychology
 Note the change from patients to clients .	0	psychology
 4183 . While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy , they also are taken by individuals not in therapy .	0	psychology
 This is known as biomedical therapy .	0	psychology
 Medications used to treat psychological disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors , including psychiatrists .	1	psychology
 4186 . When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .	0	psychology
 Coping refers to mental and behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress , including its presumed cause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces .	1	psychology
 4189 . As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things .	0	psychology
 Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) .	1	psychology
 Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well - being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 4192 . While having social support is quite beneficial , being the recipient of prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes .	0	psychology
 In their literature review , Brondolo , Brady , Pencille , Beatty , and Contrada ( 2009 ) describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique , significant stressors for those who are the targets of such attitudes and behavior .	0	psychology
 Being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression , lowered self - esteem , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease .	0	psychology
 4195 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :	1	psychology
 4198 . Although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating , it is — admittedly — somewhat of a grim topic .	0	psychology
 Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and encouraging approach to human affairs — the quest for happiness .	0	psychology
 4201 . In 1998 , Seligman ( the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier ) , who was then president of the American Psychological Association , urged psychologists to focus more on understanding how to build human strength and psychological well - being .	0	psychology
 In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4204 . In terms of our health , the expression , “ do n’t worry , be happy ” is helpful advice indeed .	0	psychology
 There has also been much work suggesting that optimism — the general tendency to look on the bright side of things — is also a significant predictor of positive health outcomes .	1	psychology
 4207 . In the late 1700s , a French physician , Philippe Pinel , argued for more humane treatment of the mentally ill .	0	psychology
 He suggested that they be unchained and talked to , and that ’s just what he did for patients at La Salpêtrière in Paris in 1795 ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4210 . If an individual is mandated to attend therapy , she is seeking services involuntarily .	0	psychology
 Involuntary treatment refers to therapy that is not the individual ’s choice .	1	psychology
 Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment .	0	psychology
 4213 . Diego likely has attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .	0	psychology
 The symptoms of this disorder were first described by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s .	0	psychology
 4216 . Despite the retraction , the reporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting .	0	psychology
 A recent survey of parents , for example , found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern ( Kennedy , LaVail , Nowak , Basket , & Landry , 2011 ) ; and perhaps fearing that their children would develop autism , more than 10 % of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 Some parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine - autism link .	0	psychology
 3312 . This is precisely the situation that Charles Darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In simple terms , the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce , while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off .	1	psychology
 3315 . During the egg 's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes .	0	psychology
 Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .	1	psychology
 DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs .	1	psychology
 3318 . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) .	1	psychology
 A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .	1	psychology
 Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 ( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .	1	psychology
 3327 . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene .	0	psychology
 Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .	1	psychology
 Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .	0	psychology
 3330 . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction .	0	psychology
 Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall .	1	psychology
 For example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation .	0	psychology
 3333 . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious .	0	psychology
 For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - twin siblings ) .	1	psychology
 But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’s life .	0	psychology
 3336 . In a study of people who were given up for adoption , adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study :	0	psychology
 3339 . Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .	1	psychology
 Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons .	0	psychology
 3342 . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .	1	psychology
 The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .	0	psychology
 3345 . These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .	0	psychology
 The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 3348 . Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .	0	psychology
 Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters .	1	psychology
 3351 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential .	1	psychology
 Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .	0	psychology
 3354 . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals .	1	psychology
 The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions .	0	psychology
 3357 . The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) .	0	psychology
 Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake .	0	psychology
 Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3360 . In this perspective , psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders .	0	psychology
 Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance .	1	psychology
 Acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory ; it can increase arousal and enhance cognition .	0	psychology
 3363 . The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions : the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , shown in [ link ] .	0	psychology
 The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord ; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body .	1	psychology
 3366 . It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress - related activities ; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine , day - to - day operations .	1	psychology
 The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .	0	psychology
 3369 . For example , think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people , or right before taking a big test .	0	psychology
 You are in no real physical danger in those situations , and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response .	0	psychology
 This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world ; in fact , we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee .	0	psychology
 3372 . These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .	0	psychology
 The most prominent sulcus , known as the longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres : the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere .	1	psychology
 3375 . Forebrain StructuresThe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain ( [ link ] ) , which is the largest part of the brain .	0	psychology
 The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex ( called subcortical structures ) : thalamus , hypothalamus , pituitary gland , and the limbic system ( collection of structures ) .	1	psychology
 3378 . Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage .	0	psychology
 On September 13 , 1848 , Gage ( age 25 ) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont .	0	psychology
 3381 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .	1	psychology
 It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .	1	psychology
 The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically , which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3384 . The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology
 Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .	1	psychology
 Whereas individuals with damage to Broca ’s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to Wernicke ’s area can produce sensible language , but they are unable to understand it ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3387 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .	0	psychology
 The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .	1	psychology
 All of our senses , with the exception of smell , are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3390 . The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .	1	psychology
 The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .	1	psychology
 3393 . Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 3396 . The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord .	1	psychology
 It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3399 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) receives messages from muscles , tendons , joints , and structures in our ear to control balance , coordination , movement , and motor skills .	1	psychology
 The cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories .	0	psychology
 3402 . A computerized tomography ( CT ) scan involves taking a number of x - rays of a particular section of a person ’s body or brain ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The x - rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates , allowing a computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned .	0	psychology
 3405 . Tissues of different densities give off different signals , which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor .	0	psychology
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) operates on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels .	1	psychology
 The fMRI provides more detailed images of the brain ’s structure , as well as better accuracy in time , than is possible in PET scans ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3408 . Major GlandsThe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it .	1	psychology
 The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .	0	psychology
 3411 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .	1	psychology
 The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .	1	psychology
 These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .	0	psychology
 3414 . For one , each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment .	0	psychology
 An informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment , including potential risks and implications of the research .	1	psychology
 It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time .	0	psychology

 3420 . Correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables ( such as ice cream consumption and crime ) , but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect .	1	psychology
 When two variables are correlated , it simply means that as one variable changes , so does the other .	1	psychology
 3423 . Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .	0	psychology
 A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions .	1	psychology
 If two variables are negatively correlated , a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa .	0	psychology
 3426 . Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer .	0	psychology
 It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer , but if we were limited to correlational research , we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption .	0	psychology
 3429 . As you ’ve learned , the only way to establish that there is a cause - and - effect relationship between two variables is to conduct a scientific experiment .	0	psychology
 Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life .	0	psychology
 3432 . We also need to precisely define , or operationalize , what is considered violent and nonviolent .	0	psychology
 An operational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables , and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment .	1	psychology
 In operationalizing violent behavior , we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior , or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges .	0	psychology
 3435 . In a double - blind study , both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments .	1	psychology
 Why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group ?	0	psychology
 3438 . In our example of how violent television programs affect children ’s display of violent behavior , the independent variable is the type of program — violent or nonviolent — viewed by participants in the study ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had .	1	psychology
 In our example , the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants .	0	psychology
 3441 . Now that we have a sample , the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment .	0	psychology
 With random assignment , all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group .	1	psychology
 There is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group .	0	psychology
 3444 . The American Psychological Association ( APA ) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for submission to scientific journals .	0	psychology
 Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology Today , which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology , scientific journals generally publish peer - reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves .	1	psychology
 3447 . This is where validity comes into play .	0	psychology
 Validity refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it ’s supposed to measure .	1	psychology
 While any valid measure is by necessity reliable , the reverse is not necessarily true .	0	psychology
 3450 . We want our researcher to be inconspicuous — perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information .	0	psychology
 This type of observational study is called naturalistic observation : observing behavior in its natural setting .	1	psychology
 To better understand peer exclusion , Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground .	0	psychology
 3453 . Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias .	0	psychology
 Generally , people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations .	1	psychology
 3456 . Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods .	0	psychology
 A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in .	1	psychology
 Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population .	0	psychology
 3459 . Another approach is cross - sectional research .	0	psychology
 In cross - sectional research , a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time .	1	psychology
 Using the dietary habits example above , the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age .	0	psychology
 3462 . One of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars .	0	psychology
 As the new governor , you need to decide whether to continue funding the D.A.R.E .	0	psychology
 ( Drug Abuse Resistance Education ) program in public schools ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 This program typically involves police officers coming into the classroom to educate students about the dangers of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs .	1	psychology
 3465 . The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive .	0	psychology
 In deductive reasoning , ideas are tested against the empirical world ; in inductive reasoning , empirical observations lead to new ideas ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 These processes are inseparable , like inhaling and exhaling , but different research approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects .	0	psychology
 3468 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .	0	psychology
 Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3471 . The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind .	1	psychology
 Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge .	0	psychology
 3474 . Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .	0	psychology
 A dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’s doctoral training .	1	psychology
 In the United States , a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3477 . Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in the preceding section .	0	psychology
 Reflective of the discipline ’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the United States .	1	psychology
 3480 . Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As such , sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary .	0	psychology
 3483 . Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood , providing enormous insight into the differences in physical , cognitive , and social capacities that exist between very young children and adults .	0	psychology
 For instance , research by Jean Piaget ( [ link ] ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence .	0	psychology
 Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are hidden from us .	1	psychology
 3486 . Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .	1	psychology
 These five dimensions are known as the “ Big Five ” or the Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness , and extraversion ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan ( e.g. , Rantanen , Metsäpelto , Feldt , Pulkinnen , and Kokko , 2007 ; Soldz & Vaillant , 1999 ; McCrae & Costa , 2008 ) and is influenced by genetics ( e.g. , Jang , Livesly , and Vernon , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 3489 . Industrial - Organizational psychology ( I - O psychology ) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological theories , principles , and research findings in industrial and organizational settings .	1	psychology
 I - O psychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management , organizational structure , and workplace environment .	0	psychology
 3492 . Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance , including motivation and performance anxiety , and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing .	1	psychology
 Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general .	0	psychology
 3495 . As mentioned earlier , both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still found among some of today ’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective , Roger ’s ideas about client - centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate .	0	psychology
 Furthermore , both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of behavioral therapy , cognitive therapy , and cognitive - behavioral therapy ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3498 . Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience .	0	psychology
 Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed .	1	psychology
 Wundt ’s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) .	0	psychology
 3501 . Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected .	1	psychology
 As James saw it , psychology ’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism .	0	psychology
 Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment .	1	psychology
 3504 . These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles .	0	psychology
 The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception .	1	psychology
 For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony .	0	psychology
 3507 . Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control .	1	psychology
 Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism .	0	psychology
 A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism .	0	psychology
 3510 . Thus , humanism emerged .	0	psychology
 Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans .	1	psychology
 Two of the most well - known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers ( O’Hara , n.d . ) .	0	psychology
 3513 . Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under - studied .	0	psychology
 There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) .	0	psychology
 3516 . Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .	1	psychology
 Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .	1	psychology
 In between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming , intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use , meditative states , hypnotic states , and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation .	0	psychology
 3519 . If we have biological rhythms , then is there some sort of biological clock ?	0	psychology
 In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .	1	psychology
 3522 . For example , most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day .	0	psychology
 One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .	0	psychology
 The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 3525 . When we do this , we often experience jet lag .	0	psychology
 Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .	1	psychology
 These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 3528 . When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day - to - day life , they accumulate a sleep debt .	0	psychology
 A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis .	0	psychology
 The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency .	0	psychology
 3531 . One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology .	0	psychology
 Evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection .	1	psychology
 Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring .	0	psychology
 3534 . The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep .	0	psychology
 Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep , the period during which we drift off to sleep .	1	psychology
 During this time , there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat .	0	psychology
 3537 . As we move into stage 2 sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation .	1	psychology
 Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3540 . Stage 3 and stage 4 of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow - wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency ( up to 4 Hz ) , high amplitude delta waves ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 During this time , an individual ’s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically .	0	psychology
 3543 . Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .	1	psychology
 Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .	1	psychology
 For instance , if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake , Freud might have argued that this represents the woman ’s fear of sexual intimacy , with the snake serving as a symbol of a man ’s penis .	0	psychology
 3546 . Some forms of psychotherapy , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy , can help sufferers of insomnia .	0	psychology
 Cognitive - behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors .	1	psychology
 The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia ( e.g. , spending more waking time in bed ) .	0	psychology
 3549 . REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase does not occur .	1	psychology
 Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep , especially during disturbing dreams .	0	psychology
 3552 . Sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper ’s breathing stops .	1	psychology
 These episodes can last 10–20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal .	0	psychology
 3555 . In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose .	0	psychology
 3558 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .	1	psychology
 These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .	1	psychology
 This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep ( Burgess & Scammell , 2012 ; Hishikawa & Shimizu , 1995 ; Luppi et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3561 . In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .	1	psychology
 In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .	1	psychology
 3564 . Ethanol , which we commonly refer to as alcohol , is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity .	1	psychology
 Other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines .	0	psychology
 3567 . The cocaine , amphetamine , cathinones , and MDMA users seek a euphoric high , feelings of intense elation and pleasure , especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking .	0	psychology
 Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences .	0	psychology
 3570 . An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and codeine .	1	psychology
 Opioids have analgesic properties ; that is , they decrease pain .	0	psychology
 3573 . Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .	1	psychology
 Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .	1	psychology
 Other drugs , including the opioid buprenorphine , have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal .	0	psychology
 3576 . Hypnosis is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli .	1	psychology
 In the therapeutic setting , a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient .	0	psychology
 3579 . These cells relay messages , in the form of action potentials ( as you learned when studying biopsychology ) , to the central nervous system .	0	psychology
 The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction .	1	psychology
 3582 . Sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them .	1	psychology
 This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold .	0	psychology
 Unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity .	0	psychology
 3585 . On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .	1	psychology
 This is called top - down processing .	0	psychology
 3588 . If so , then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise .	0	psychology
 The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory .	1	psychology
 This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep .	0	psychology
 3591 . Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .	1	psychology
 Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .	1	psychology
 3594 . The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays , x - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light , infrared light , microwaves , and radio waves .	0	psychology
 3597 . This is known as the timbre of a sound .	0	psychology
 Timbre refers to a sound ’s purity , and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency , amplitude , and timing of sound waves .	1	psychology
 3600 . It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .	0	psychology
 The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes , and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal .	1	psychology
 When light levels are low , the pupil will become dilated , or expanded , to allow more light to enter the eye .	0	psychology
 3603 . The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .	0	psychology
 In a normal - sighted individual , the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea , which is part of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye .	1	psychology
 The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3606 . While cones are concentrated in the fovea , where images tend to be focused , rods , another type of photoreceptor , are located throughout the remainder of the retina .	0	psychology
 Rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions , and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones , they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field .	1	psychology
 3609 . The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the optic chiasm is an X - shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain .	0	psychology
 7023 . The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years .	0	government
 The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II .	0	government
 The president negotiates a treaty , the Senate consents to the treaty by a two - thirds vote , and finally the president ratifies it .	0	government
 7026 . On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .	0	government
 In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law . United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .	0	government
 Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .	0	government
 Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement .	0	government
 7029 . Madeleine Albright ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was nominated by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the Senate 99–0 .	0	government
 Colin Powell ( b ) , nominated by George W. Bush , was also unanimously confirmed .	0	government
 7032 . These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president , including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis , executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises .	1	government
 These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “ energy and dispatch ” that Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency .	0	government
 Emergency spending does involve Congress through its power of the purse , but Congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies .	0	government
 7038 . Probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the Eisenhower presidency .	0	government
 When President Dwight D. Eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the Senate as treaties , Congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment ( the Bricker Amendment ) that would have altered the treaty process as we know it .	0	government
 Eisenhower understood the message and began to send more agreements through the process as treaties . Krutz and Peake .	0	government
 7044 . First , congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties speak on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues , including foreign policy .	0	government
 Some House and Senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees , such as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and the two defense committees ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 These members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy .	0	government
 7047 . The national security advisor heads the president ’s National Security Council , a group of senior - level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy advisor . Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .	1	government
 Even more important on intelligence than the CIA director is the director of national intelligence , a position created in the government reorganizations after 9/11 , who oversees the entire intelligence community in the U.S. government .	0	government
 7056 . The end of the Cold War opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller European countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared .	0	government
 Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement , including a vocal senator , Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , who was against the United States continuing to be the military “ policeman ” of the world .	0	government
 Helms was famous for opposing nearly all treaties brought to the Senate during his tenure .	0	government
 7059 . There is an element of idealism in liberal internationalism , because the United States assumes other countries will also put their best foot forward .	0	government
 A classic example of a liberal internationalist is President Woodrow Wilson , who sought a League of Nations to voluntarily save the world after World War I .	0	government
 7062 . Neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes , the United States should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world .	0	government
 The aggressive use ( or threat ) of hard power is the core value of neoconservatism .	1	government
 Acting unilaterally is acceptable in this view , as is adopting a preemptive strategy in which the United States intervenes militarily before the enemy can make its move .	0	government
 7071 . In 1946 , Mexican American parents in California , with the assistance of the NAACP , sued several California school districts that forced Mexican and Mexican American children to attend segregated schools .	0	government
 In the case of Mendez v. Westminster ( 1947 ) , the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court held that the segregation of Mexican and Mexican American students into separate schools was unconstitutional . Mendez v. Westminister School District , 64 F. Supp .	1	government

 Topics that remain at the forefront of public debate today include immigration reform , the DREAM Act ( a proposal for granting undocumented immigrants permanent residency in stages ) , and court action on President Obama ’s executive orders on immigration .	1	government
 7080 . In 1913 , California passed a law preventing all Asians , not just the Chinese , from owning land .	0	government
 With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 , all Asians , with the exception of Filipinos , were prevented from immigrating to the United States or becoming naturalized citizens .	1	government
 Laws in several states barred marriage between Chinese and white Americans , and some cities with large Asian populations required Asian children to attend segregated schools . See Gabriel Chin and Hrishi Kathrikeyan .	0	government
 7083 . Ironically , violence directed indiscriminately against Chinese , Japanese , Koreans , and Vietnamese caused members of these groups to unite around a shared pan - Asian identity , much as Native Americans had in the Pan - Indian movement .	0	government
 In 1968 , students of Asian ancestry at the University of California at Berkeley formed the Asian American Political Alliance .	0	government
 Asian American students also joined Chicano , Native American , and African American students to demand that colleges offer ethnic studies courses . See William Wei .	0	government
 7089 . In 1973 , the American Psychological Association ended its classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder .	0	government
 In 1994 , the U.S. military adopted the policy of “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ” This act , Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 , officially prohibited discrimination against suspected gays , lesbians , and bisexuals by the U.S. military .	1	government
 It also prohibited superior officers from asking about or investigating the sexual orientation of those below them in rank . Public Law 103–160 : National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 .	0	government
 However , those gays , lesbians , and bisexuals who spoke openly about their sexual orientation were still subject to dismissal because it remained illegal for anyone except heterosexuals to serve in the armed forces .	0	government
 7092 . The legalization of same - sex marriage throughout the United States led some people to feel their religious beliefs were under attack , and many religiously conservative business owners have refused to acknowledge LBGT rights or the legitimacy of same - sex marriages .	0	government
 Following swiftly upon the heels of the Obergefell ruling , the Indiana legislature passed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) .	0	government
 Congress had already passed such a law in 1993 ; it was intended to extend protection to minority religions , such as by allowing rituals of the Native American Church .	1	government

 3615 . We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth .	0	psychology
 Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .	1	psychology
 One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .	1	psychology
 3621 . The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .	0	psychology
 The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3624 . We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory .	0	psychology
 The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron .	1	psychology
 This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave .	0	psychology
 3627 . Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound .	1	psychology
 3630 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .	1	psychology
 Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .	1	psychology
 3633 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .	1	psychology
 One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 3636 . This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array .	1	psychology
 The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain .	0	psychology
 3639 . You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste : sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .	0	psychology
 Research demonstrates , however , that we have at least six taste groupings .	0	psychology
 Umami is our fifth taste .	0	psychology
 3642 . Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose .	1	psychology
 Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3645 . These receptors include Meissner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian corpuscles , Merkel ’s disks , and Ruffini corpuscles .	0	psychology
 Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .	1	psychology
 Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .	1	psychology
 3648 . Generally speaking , pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature .	0	psychology
 Pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain .	1	psychology
 In some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system .	0	psychology
 3651 . The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( utricle , saccule , and the three semicircular canals ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear .	0	psychology
 3654 . One Gestalt principle is the figure - ground relationship .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground .	1	psychology
 3657 . Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity ( or good continuation ) and closure .	0	psychology
 The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3660 . You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 Our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses : educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information .	1	psychology
 These hypotheses are informed by a number of factors , including our personalities , experiences , and expectations .	0	psychology
 3663 . Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with .	0	psychology
 Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment .	1	psychology
 They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .	0	psychology
 3666 . Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence .	0	psychology
 Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment .	1	psychology
 You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious .	0	psychology
 3669 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	1	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3672 . Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response .	1	psychology
 Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs .	0	psychology
 3675 . Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet .	0	psychology
 Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning .	1	psychology
 This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus : the squeaky cabinet ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3678 . Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone .	0	psychology
 Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response .	0	psychology
 3681 . On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination .	1	psychology
 The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response .	0	psychology
 3687 . His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .	1	psychology
 Essentially , if an organism does something that brings about a desired result , the organism is more likely to do it again .	0	psychology
 3690 . Remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .	1	psychology
 In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .	1	psychology
 3693 . ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments , Skinner often used an approach called shaping .	0	psychology
 Instead of rewarding only the target behavior , in shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior .	1	psychology
 Why is shaping needed ?	0	psychology
 3699 . With a variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are unpredictable .	1	psychology
 Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast - food restaurant .	0	psychology
 3702 . Although strict behaviorists such as Skinner and Watson refused to believe that cognition ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another behaviorist , Edward C. Tolman , had a different opinion .	0	psychology
 Tolman ’s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930 ; Tolman , Ritchie , & Kalish , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 3705 . Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning , which are forms of associative learning .	0	psychology
 In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 3708 . Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account .	0	psychology
 According to Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement .	0	psychology
 He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation .	0	psychology
 3711 . What are the implications of this study ?	0	psychology
 Bandura concluded that we watch and learn , and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects .	0	psychology
 Prosocial ( positive ) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior .	0	psychology
 3714 . The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts .	0	psychology
 Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .	1	psychology
 Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .	0	psychology
 3717 . An artificial concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics .	1	psychology
 Various properties of geometric shapes , like squares and triangles , serve as useful examples of artificial concepts .	0	psychology
 3723 . Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	1	psychology
 Grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon ( Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 For instance , English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “ -ed ” at the end to indicate past tense .	0	psychology
 3726 . Semantics and syntax are part of a language ’s grammar .	0	psychology
 Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3729 . B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds .	0	psychology
 3732 . Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 For example , a well - known strategy is trial and error .	0	psychology
 The old adage , “ If at first you do n’t succeed , try , try again ” describes trial and error .	0	psychology
 3738 . The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias .	0	psychology
 An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 3741 . Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .	1	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .	1	psychology
 3744 . Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .	1	psychology
 In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others .	1	psychology
 3747 . According to the drive theory of motivation , deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs .	1	psychology
 These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to homeostasis .	0	psychology
 3750 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .	1	psychology
 Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .	0	psychology
 3753 . In the 1940s , Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components : crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence ( Cattell , 1963 ) .	0	psychology
 Crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it .	1	psychology
 When you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using crystallized intelligence .	0	psychology
 3756 . Practical intelligence , as proposed by Sternberg , is sometimes compared to “ street smarts . ” Being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences .	1	psychology
 This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ ; individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence ( Sternberg , 1988 ) .	0	psychology
 3759 . Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner , a Harvard psychologist and former student of Erik Erikson .	0	psychology
 Gardner ’s theory , which has been refined for more than 30 years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence .	0	psychology
 3762 . Creativity is the ability to generate , create , or discover new ideas , solutions , and possibilities .	1	psychology
 Very creative people often have intense knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at novel solutions , seek out the advice and help of other experts , and take risks .	0	psychology
 3765 . For most people , once they have eaten , they feel satiation , or fullness and satisfaction , and their eating behavior stops .	0	psychology
 Like the initiation of eating , satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms .	0	psychology
 3768 . Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play .	0	psychology
 A person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time , and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates .	1	psychology
 People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism .	0	psychology
 3771 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .	1	psychology
 People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	1	psychology
 3774 . Prader - Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism .	1	psychology
 Typically , affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating .	0	psychology
 3777 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	0	psychology
 3780 . Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual ’s sexual orientation ( Jenkins , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and erotic attractions to same - sexed individuals ( homosexual ) , opposite - sexed individuals ( heterosexual ) , or both ( bisexual ) .	1	psychology
 3783 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	1	psychology
 3786 . In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation .	1	psychology
 While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 3789 . When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender dysphoria .	0	psychology
 Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are .	1	psychology
 This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria .	0	psychology
 3792 . As a result , the test was normed and standardized , which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) .	0	psychology
 Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 3795 . Without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population .	0	psychology
 A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population .	1	psychology
 If , for example , you measured the height of the women in your classroom only , you might not actually have a representative sample .	0	psychology
 3807 . The Schachter - Singer two - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience .	0	psychology
 According to this theory , emotions are composed of two factors : physiological and cognitive .	1	psychology
 3810 . THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONSEarlier , you learned about the limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The limbic system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , and the hippocampus .	0	psychology
 3813 . It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 The central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems’ activity ( Pessoa , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3816 . This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin ’s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .	0	psychology
 In fact , there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions .	0	psychology
 These include : happiness , surprise , sadness , fright , disgust , contempt , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( Ekman & Keltner , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 3819 . Personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think , feel , and behave in specific ways .	1	psychology
 Our personality is what makes us unique individuals .	0	psychology
 3822 . According to Freud , unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood sexuality , are the forces that influence our personality .	0	psychology
 Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality .	1	psychology
 These theorists , referred to as neo - Freudians , generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality .	0	psychology
 3825 . The unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges , and is present from birth .	1	psychology
 It directs impulses for hunger , thirst , and sex .	0	psychology
 3828 . According to Freud , a person who has a strong ego , which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego , has a healthy personality .	0	psychology
 Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or unhealthy behaviors .	1	psychology
 For example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive .	0	psychology
 3834 . In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .	1	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 3837 . After passing through the oral stage , children enter what Freud termed the anal stage ( 1–3 years ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training .	1	psychology
 3840 . The final stage is the genital stage ( from puberty on ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface .	1	psychology
 3843 . He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology
 An inferiority complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society .	1	psychology
 3846 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) . These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 3849 . Memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer .	0	psychology
 Memory is the set of processes used to encode , store , and retrieve information over different periods of time ( [ link]).Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Storage is the retention of the encoded information .	1	psychology
 3852 . It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information .	1	psychology
 This is known as effortful processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3855 . Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect .	0	psychology
 The self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance ( Rogers , Kuiper & Kirker , 1977 ) .	1	psychology
 Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter ?	0	psychology
 3858 . In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 Their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called Atkinson - Shiffrin ( A - S ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information .	1	psychology
 3861 . Short - term memory ( STM ) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory .	1	psychology
 Short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long - term memory .	0	psychology
 3864 . Understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types .	0	psychology
 Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall .	1	psychology
 For example , if you are studying for your chemistry exam , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory .	0	psychology
 3867 . Declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced .	1	psychology
 Explicit ( declarative ) memory has two parts : semantic memory and episodic memory .	0	psychology
 3870 . Can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — meals , conversations , clothing choices , weather conditions , and so on ?	0	psychology
 Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions ; however , American actress Marilu Henner , best known for the television show Taxi , can remember .	0	psychology
 She has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3873 . There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and relearning .	0	psychology
 Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval : it means you can access information without cues .	1	psychology
 For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 3876 . Karl Lashley began exploring this problem , about 100 years ago , by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys .	0	psychology
 He was searching for evidence of the engram : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( Josselyn , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 First , Lashley ( 1950 ) trained rats to find their way through a maze .	0	psychology
 3879 . Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats , and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks , such as object recognition and maze running .	0	psychology
 3882 . It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories , and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories ; this is called arousal theory ( Christianson , 1992 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which strengthen memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event .	0	psychology
 3885 . Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning .	0	psychology
 He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .	0	psychology
 3888 . Bandura ( 1977 , 1995 ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - efficacy .	0	psychology
 Self - efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities , developed through our social experiences .	1	psychology
 Self - efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals .	0	psychology
 3891 . Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford , where he was a colleague of Albert Bandura .	0	psychology
 Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior , and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology .	0	psychology
 3894 . Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma .	1	psychology
 People with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past .	0	psychology
 3897 . In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes , the Innocence Project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions ( Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Yeshiva University , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3900 . Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome .	1	psychology
 This syndrome has received a lot of publicity , particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses — often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) .	0	psychology
 3903 . I know I read the book in high school , and I remember that one of the main characters is named Scout , and her father is an attorney , but I honestly do n’t remember anything else . ” Nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is surprised she ca n’t recall the plot .	0	psychology
 What is going on here is storage decay : unused information tends to fade with the passage of time . In 1885 , German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization .	1	psychology
 First , he memorized lists of nonsense syllables .	0	psychology
 3906 . Memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final distortion error .	0	psychology
 Schacter ( 2001 ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events .	0	psychology
 3909 . These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .	0	psychology
 Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .	1	psychology
 For example , this week you are studying about Freud ’s Psychoanalytic Theory .	0	psychology
 3912 . Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers .	0	psychology
 One of Rogers ’s main ideas about personality regards self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves .	1	psychology
 How would you respond to the question , “ Who am I ? ” Your answer can show how you see yourself .	0	psychology
 4312 . Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .	1	economic
 These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .	0	economic
 4315 . Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .	0	economic
 In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .	1	economic
 4321 . How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?	0	economic
 Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank .	1	economic
 For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use .	0	economic
 A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other .	1	economic
 The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials .	0	economic
 4327 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .	1	economic
 4330 . Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure .	0	economic
 A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses .	1	economic
 The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .	0	economic
 4336 . Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .	1	economic
 Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .	1	economic
 4339 . Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired .	1	economic
 The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative .	0	economic
 4342 . People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide .	0	economic
 Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real .	0	economic
 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either .	0	economic
 This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) .	0	economic
 There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice .	0	economic
 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline .	1	economic
 When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .	0	economic
 4351 . Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires .	1	economic
 How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics .	0	economic
 4354 . Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists .	0	economic
 Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be .	0	economic
 For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city .	0	economic
 4357 . But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level .	0	economic
 The second theme is tradeoffs .	0	economic
 As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good .	0	economic
 4360 . Finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices .	0	economic
 An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today .	0	economic
 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 4366 . An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	1	economic
 Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4369 . Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .	0	economic
 Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve .	0	economic
 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity .	1	economic
 While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves .	0	economic
 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices .	0	economic
 The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence .	1	economic
 Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good .	0	economic
 4378 . The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas .	0	economic
 The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good .	1	economic
 4381 . Let ’s define what is meant by the firm .	0	economic
 A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs .	1	economic
 If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .	0	economic
 4384 . We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit .	0	economic
 Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made .	1	economic
 Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .	0	economic
 4387 . It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .	0	economic
 Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs .	1	economic
 The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit .	0	economic
 4390 . Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term .	1	economic
 Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same .	0	economic
 4393 . Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output .	1	economic
 Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut .	0	economic
 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well .	1	economic
 This situation is called diseconomies of scale .	0	economic
 A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials .	0	economic
 4405 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .	1	economic
 The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 4411 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .	1	economic
 Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 4414 . Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph .	0	economic
 A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices .	1	economic
 Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .	0	economic
 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .	1	economic
 The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .	1	economic
 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price .	1	economic
 In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel .	0	economic
 4423 . The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .	1	economic
 Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal .	0	economic
 A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant .	0	economic
 4426 . The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising .	0	economic
 It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 .	0	economic
 4429 . These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .	0	economic
 Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .	0	economic
 The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens .	0	economic
 4432 . For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .	0	economic
 A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right . When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .	0	economic
 For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .	0	economic
 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) .	0	economic
 So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher .	0	economic
 Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 .	0	economic
 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be .	0	economic
 According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 .	0	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe .	0	economic
 In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 .	0	economic
 4441 . At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results .	0	economic
 In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have .	0	economic
 Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises .	0	economic
 4444 . In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage .	0	economic
 Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living .	0	economic
 4447 . The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets .	0	economic
 According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow .	0	economic
 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .	0	economic
 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices .	0	economic
 In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate .	0	economic
 The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption .	1	economic
 This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utilitychange in quantityMU = change in total utilitychange in quantityNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility .	0	economic
 4459 . This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility .	0	economic
 Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie .	0	economic
 4462 . How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?	0	economic
 Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line .	0	economic
 But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?	0	economic
 4465 . This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously .	0	economic
 The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .	1	economic
 The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .	1	economic
 4468 . Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example .	0	economic
 The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint .	0	economic
 4471 . [ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint .	0	economic
 Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement .	0	economic

 So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics .	1	economic
 It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation .	0	economic
 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold .	1	economic
 This is referred to as the market structure of the industry .	0	economic
 In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition .	0	economic
 4480 . A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce .	0	economic
 To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :	0	economic
 4483 . In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced .	0	economic
 If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise .	0	economic
 4486 . No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price .	0	economic
 However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market .	0	economic
 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before .	1	economic
 Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor .	0	economic
 4492 . To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example .	0	economic
 Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC .	0	economic
 4495 . There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit .	0	economic
 One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .	1	economic
 The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .	1	economic
 4498 . Copyright Office .	0	economic
 A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years .	1	economic
 The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires .	0	economic
 4501 . But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply .	0	economic
 There is also a body of law known as trade secrets .	0	economic
 Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets .	0	economic
 4504 . Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market .	0	economic
 One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition .	1	economic
 Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove .	0	economic
 4507 . For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price .	0	economic
 But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue .	0	economic
 When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price .	0	economic
 4510 . A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition .	0	economic
 If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power .	1	economic
 They simply have to take the market price as given .	0	economic
 4513 . Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) .	0	economic
 Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive . The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly .	0	economic
 Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms .	1	economic
 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product .	0	economic
 Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers .	0	economic
 For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands .	0	economic
 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering .	0	economic
 First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces .	0	economic
 Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products .	0	economic
 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run .	0	economic
 Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit .	0	economic
 A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use .	1	economic
 4525 . Rather , they are oligopolies .	0	economic
 Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry .	1	economic
 Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel .	0	economic
 4528 . By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves .	0	economic
 When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .	1	economic
 A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .	1	economic
 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists .	0	economic
 Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”	0	economic
 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly .	1	economic
 If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits .	0	economic
 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases .	1	economic
 This situation is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4540 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .	0	economic
 When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .	1	economic
 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm .	1	economic
 Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law .	0	economic
 In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .	0	economic
 4546 . Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry .	0	economic
 An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .	1	economic
 For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .	1	economic
 4549 . Defining a market is often controversial .	0	economic
 For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems .	0	economic
 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .	1	economic
 Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .	0	economic
 4555 . Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product .	1	economic
 Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need .	0	economic
 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s .	0	economic
 Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care .	0	economic
 4561 . The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest .	0	economic
 Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point .	0	economic
 This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A .	0	economic
 4564 . Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well .	0	economic
 The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates .	1	economic
 The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular — airlines . What are the results of airline deregulation ?	0	economic
 4567 . The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as Wachovia , and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) , which had to be nationalized — that is , taken over by the federal government .	1	economic
 One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd - Frank Act , which attempted major reforms of the financial system .	0	economic

 4570 . The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .	1	economic
 Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	0	economic
 If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	0	economic
 4573 . Pollution is a negative externality .	0	economic
 Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .	0	economic
 The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society .	1	economic
 4576 . However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .	0	economic
 Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .	0	economic
 When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) .	1	economic
 4579 . In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .	0	economic
 Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .	0	economic
 These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades .	0	economic
 4582 . When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g .	0	economic
 cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards .	0	economic
 4585 . However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs .	0	economic
 A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one .	0	economic
 The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion .	0	economic
 4588 . However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used .	0	economic
 The marginal cost curve rises .	0	economic
 Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits .	0	economic
 4591 . However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth .	0	economic
 After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today .	0	economic
 It is hard to tell people who are living in a low - income country , where adequate diet , health care , and education are lacking , that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment .	0	economic
 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .	0	economic
 4597 . In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea .	0	economic
 Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug .	0	economic
 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .	0	economic
 The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	1	economic

 In the 1960s , a gauge theory , called electroweak theory , was developed by Steven Weinberg , Sheldon Glashow , and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies .	1	physics
 One of its predictions , in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena , was the existence of the W+,W−W+,W− , and Z0Z0 carrier particles .	0	physics

 Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity .	0	physics
 We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .	1	physics
 3277 . We know from Special Relativity that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event , particularly if they move relative to one another .	1	physics
 Einstein ’s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity .	1	physics
 General relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light .	1	physics
 3280 . Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape .	1	physics
 Bodies , like the Earth or the Sun , have what is called an escape velocity .	0	physics
 3283 . These objects were first discovered in 1967 by the British astrophysicists , Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish .	0	physics
 Neutron stars are literally a star composed of neutrons .	1	physics
 They are formed by the collapse of a star ’s core in a supernova , during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons ( the reverse of neutron ββ size 12{β } { } decay ) .	0	physics
 3286 . Introduced earlier in GUTS : The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and , thus , must contain quantum gravity .	1	physics
 The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles , including the graviton that carries the gravitational force , act like one - dimensional vibrating strings .	0	physics
 3289 . Finally , the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant , so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose . After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant , most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open .	0	physics
 Since matter can be thought to curve the space around it , we call an open universe negatively curved .	0	physics
 This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction .	1	physics
 3292 . The question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun are there .	0	physics
 If such bodies pass between us and a star , they will not block the star ’s light , being too small , but they will form a gravitational lens , as discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity . In a process called microlensing , light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner .	1	physics
 Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there .	0	physics
 3295 . The most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously unknown leptons ( sometimes obtusely referred to as non - baryonic matter ) .	0	physics
 These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation .	1	physics
 One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos .	1	physics
 3298 . It is also based partly in physics and treats broad classes of phenomena from many disciplines .	0	physics
 Chaos is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions .	1	physics
 The orbit of the planet Pluto , for example , may be chaotic in that it can change tremendously due to small interactions with other planets .	0	physics
 3301 . For example , if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell , you will hear the bell ’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by .	0	physics
 The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift .	1	physics
 The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler ( 1803–1853 ) , who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers .	0	physics
 3304 . Power is associated by many people with electricity .	0	physics
 Knowing that power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion , what is the expression for electric power ?	1	physics
 Power transmission lines might come to mind .	0	physics
 3307 . Lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in American universities .	0	physics
 He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations , and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him . A synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated .	1	physics
 Particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed - radius orbits .	0	physics
 4312 . Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .	1	economic
 These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .	0	economic
 4315 . Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .	0	economic
 In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .	1	economic
 4321 . How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?	0	economic
 Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank .	1	economic
 For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use .	0	economic
 A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other .	1	economic
 The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials .	0	economic
 4327 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .	1	economic
 4330 . Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure .	0	economic
 A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses .	1	economic
 The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .	0	economic
 4336 . Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .	1	economic
 Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .	1	economic
 4339 . Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired .	1	economic
 The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative .	0	economic
 4342 . People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide .	0	economic
 Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real .	0	economic
 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either .	0	economic
 This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) .	0	economic
 There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice .	0	economic
 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline .	1	economic
 When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .	0	economic
 4351 . Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires .	1	economic
 How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics .	0	economic
 4354 . Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists .	0	economic
 Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be .	0	economic
 For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city .	0	economic
 4357 . But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level .	0	economic
 The second theme is tradeoffs .	0	economic
 As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good .	0	economic
 4360 . Finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices .	0	economic
 An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today .	0	economic
 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 4366 . An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	1	economic
 Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4369 . Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .	0	economic
 Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve .	0	economic
 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity .	1	economic
 While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves .	0	economic
 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices .	0	economic
 The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence .	1	economic
 Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good .	0	economic
 4378 . The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas .	0	economic
 The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good .	1	economic
 4381 . Let ’s define what is meant by the firm .	0	economic
 A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs .	1	economic
 If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .	0	economic
 4384 . We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit .	0	economic
 Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made .	1	economic
 Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .	0	economic
 4387 . It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .	0	economic
 Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs .	1	economic
 The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit .	0	economic
 4390 . Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term .	1	economic
 Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same .	0	economic
 4393 . Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output .	1	economic
 Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut .	0	economic
 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well .	1	economic
 This situation is called diseconomies of scale .	0	economic
 A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials .	0	economic
 4405 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .	1	economic
 The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 4411 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .	1	economic
 Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 4414 . Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph .	0	economic
 A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices .	1	economic
 Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .	0	economic
 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .	1	economic
 The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .	1	economic
 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price .	1	economic
 In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel .	0	economic
 4423 . The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .	1	economic
 Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal .	0	economic
 A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant .	0	economic
 4426 . The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising .	0	economic
 It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 .	0	economic
 4429 . These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .	0	economic
 Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .	0	economic
 The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens .	0	economic
 4432 . For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .	0	economic
 A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right . When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .	0	economic
 For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .	0	economic
 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) .	0	economic
 So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher .	0	economic
 Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 .	0	economic
 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be .	0	economic
 According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 .	0	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe .	0	economic
 In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 .	0	economic
 4441 . At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results .	0	economic
 In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have .	0	economic
 Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises .	0	economic
 4444 . In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage .	0	economic
 Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living .	0	economic
 4447 . The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets .	0	economic
 According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow .	0	economic
 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .	0	economic
 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices .	0	economic
 In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate .	0	economic
 The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption .	1	economic
 This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utilitychange in quantityMU = change in total utilitychange in quantityNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility .	0	economic
 4459 . This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility .	0	economic
 Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie .	0	economic
 4462 . How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?	0	economic
 Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line .	0	economic
 But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?	0	economic
 4465 . This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously .	0	economic
 The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .	1	economic
 The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .	1	economic
 4468 . Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example .	0	economic
 The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint .	0	economic
 4471 . [ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint .	0	economic
 Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement .	0	economic
 4474 . And what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood .	0	economic
 So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics .	1	economic
 It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation .	0	economic
 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold .	1	economic
 This is referred to as the market structure of the industry .	0	economic
 In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition .	0	economic
 4480 . A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce .	0	economic
 To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :	0	economic
 4483 . In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced .	0	economic
 If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise .	0	economic
 4486 . No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price .	0	economic
 However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market .	0	economic
 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before .	1	economic
 Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor .	0	economic
 4492 . To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example .	0	economic
 Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC .	0	economic
 4495 . There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit .	0	economic
 One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .	1	economic
 The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .	1	economic
 4498 . Copyright Office .	0	economic
 A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years .	1	economic
 The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires .	0	economic
 4501 . But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply .	0	economic
 There is also a body of law known as trade secrets .	0	economic
 Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets .	0	economic
 4504 . Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market .	0	economic
 One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition .	1	economic
 Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove .	0	economic
 4507 . For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price .	0	economic
 But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue .	0	economic
 When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price .	0	economic
 4510 . A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition .	0	economic
 If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power .	1	economic
 They simply have to take the market price as given .	0	economic
 4513 . Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) .	0	economic
 Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive . The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly .	0	economic
 Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms .	1	economic
 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product .	0	economic
 Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers .	0	economic
 For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands .	0	economic
 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering .	0	economic
 First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces .	0	economic
 Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products .	0	economic
 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run .	0	economic
 Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit .	0	economic
 A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use .	1	economic
 4525 . Rather , they are oligopolies .	0	economic
 Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry .	1	economic
 Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel .	0	economic
 4528 . By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves .	0	economic
 When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .	1	economic
 A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .	1	economic
 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists .	0	economic
 Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”	0	economic
 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly .	1	economic
 If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits .	0	economic
 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases .	1	economic
 This situation is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4540 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .	0	economic
 When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .	1	economic
 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm .	1	economic
 Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law .	0	economic
 In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .	0	economic
 4546 . Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry .	0	economic
 An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .	1	economic
 For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .	1	economic

 For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems .	0	economic
 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .	1	economic
 Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .	0	economic
 4555 . Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product .	1	economic
 Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need .	0	economic
 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s .	0	economic
 Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care .	0	economic
 4561 . The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest .	0	economic
 Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point .	0	economic
 This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A .	0	economic
 4564 . Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well .	0	economic
 The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates .	1	economic

 Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .	0	economic
 The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society .	1	economic
 4576 . However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .	0	economic
 Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .	0	economic
 When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) .	1	economic

 Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .	0	economic
 These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades .	0	economic
 4582 . When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g .	0	economic
 cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards .	0	economic
 4585 . However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs .	0	economic
 A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one .	0	economic
 The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion .	0	economic
 4588 . However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used .	0	economic
 The marginal cost curve rises .	0	economic
 Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits .	0	economic
 4591 . However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth .	0	economic
 After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today .	0	economic

 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .	0	economic
 4597 . In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea .	0	economic
 Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug .	0	economic
 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .	0	economic
 The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	1	economic

 During Reconstruction , Congress tried to curtail the president ’s removal power with the Tenure of Office Act ( 1867 ) , which required Senate concurrence to remove presidential nominees who took office upon Senate confirmation .	0	government
 Andrew Johnson ’s violation of that legislation provided the grounds for his impeachment in 1868 .	0	government

 A line - item veto is a type of veto that keeps the majority of a spending bill unaltered but nullifies certain lines of spending within it .	1	government
 While a number of states allow their governors the line - item veto ( discussed in the chapter on state and local government ) , the president acquired this power only in 1996 after Congress passed a law permitting it .	0	government

 Although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for proposals , such as the Office of Legislative Liaison with Congress , it is often left to the chief executive to offer incentives and rewards .	0	government
 Some of these are symbolic , like private meetings in the White House or an appearance on the campaign trail .	0	government
 6740 . Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies . The youth and glamour that John F.

 Under original jurisdiction , a case is heard for the first time , whereas under appellate jurisdiction , a court hears a case on appeal from a lower court and may change the lower court ’s decision .	1	government
 The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .	0	government

 Although legislative changes over the years have altered it , the basic structure of the judicial branch remains as it was set early on : At the lowest level are the district courts , where federal cases are tried , witnesses testify , and evidence and arguments are presented .	0	government
 6749 . But it took years for the Court to get to that point , and it faced a number of setbacks on the way to such recognition .	0	government
 In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit . Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .	0	government
 However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .	0	government
 In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it .

 Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .	0	government

 6917 . As an active member and leader of the Progressive movement , President Woodrow Wilson is often considered the father of U.S. public administration .	0	government
 Born in Virginia and educated in history and political science at Johns Hopkins University , Wilson became a respected intellectual in his fields with an interest in public service and a profound sense of moralism .	0	government
 6920 . Under President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s , that number reached 2.2 million , and the federal budget increased to $ 332 billion.https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/historical-tables/total-government-employment-since-1962 ( May 15 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 This growth came as a result of what Johnson called his Great Society program , intended to use the power of government to relieve suffering and accomplish social good .	1	government
 The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was designed to help end poverty by creating a Job Corps and a Neighborhood Youth Corps .	1	government
 6923 . While the bureaucracies created in these two periods served important purposes , many at that time and even now argue that the expansion came with unacceptable costs , particularly economic costs .	0	government
 The common argument that bureaucratic regulation smothers capitalist innovation was especially powerful in the Cold War environment of the 1960s , 70s , and 80s .	0	government
 But as long as voters felt they were benefiting from the bureaucratic expansion , as they typically did , the political winds supported continued growth .	0	government
 6926 . As the size of the federal government and its bureaucracy grew following the Great Depression and the Roosevelt reforms , many became increasingly concerned that the Pendleton Act prohibitions on political activities by civil servants were no longer strong enough .	0	government
 As a result of these mounting concerns , Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939—or the Political Activities Act .	0	government
 The main provision of this legislation prohibits bureaucrats from actively engaging in political campaigns and from using their federal authority via bureaucratic rank to influence the outcomes of nominations and elections .	1	government
 6929 . Civil servants receive pay based on the U.S. Federal General Schedule .	0	government
 A pay schedule is a chart that shows salary ranges for different levels ( grades ) of positions vertically and for different ranks ( steps ) of seniority horizontally .	1	government
 The Pendleton Act of 1883 allowed for this type of pay schedule , but the modern version of the schedule emerged in the 1940s and was refined in the 1990s .	0	government
 6932 . Proponents of the monopolistic model recognize the similarities between a bureaucracy like the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and a private monopoly like a regional power company or internet service provider that has no competitors .	0	government
 Such organizations are frequently criticized for waste , poor service , and a low level of client responsiveness .	0	government

 They proposed the negotiated rulemaking process , often referred to as regulatory negotiation , or “ reg - neg ” for short .	0	government
 This process was codified in the Negotiated Rulemaking Acts of 1990 and 1996 , which encouraged agencies to employ negotiated rulemaking procedures .	0	government
 While negotiated rulemaking is required in only a handful of agencies and plenty still use the traditional process , others have recognized the potential of the new process and have adopted it .	0	government
 6941 . The debate over one particular bureaucratic response to the recession provides important insight into these divisions .	0	government
 The bureau in question is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) , an agency created in 2011 specifically to oversee certain financial industries that had proven themselves to be especially prone to abusive practices , such as sub - prime mortgage lenders and payday lenders .	1	government
 To many in the Republican Party , this new bureau was merely another instance of growing the federal bureaucracy to take care of problems caused by an inefficient government .	0	government
 6944 . Under heightened skepticism due to government inefficiency and outright corruption in the 1970s , government officials began looking for solutions .	0	government
 When Congress drafted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 , it specifically included rights for federal whistleblowers , those who publicize misdeeds committed within a bureaucracy or other organization , and set up protection from reprisals .	1	government
 The act ’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi - juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints , conducts investigations into possible abuses , and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out . Campbell , “ Civil Service Reform , ” 100 .	1	government
 Over time , Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts .	0	government
 6947 . On March 25 , 2010 , both chambers of Congress passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ( HCERA).“H.R .	0	government
 4872 — Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 , ” https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4872 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 The story of the HCERA , which expanded and improved some provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , also known as Obamacare , is a complicated tale of insider politics in which the Democratic Party was able to enact sweeping health care and higher education reforms over fierce Republican opposition ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Some people laud the HCERA as an example of getting things done in the face of partisan gridlock in Congress ; others see it a case of government power run amok .	0	government
 6950 . The president can also implement or change policy through an executive order , which offers instructions about how to implement law under his or her discretion ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 Finally , policy changes can come as a result of court actions or opinions , such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ( 1954 ) , which formally ended school segregation in the United States . Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) .	1	government
 6953 . During the Great Depression of the 1930s , the United States created a set of policies and programs that constituted a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs , their homes , and their savings ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the federal government began programs like the Work Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps to combat unemployment and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation to refinance Depression - related mortgage debts .	0	government
 As the effects of the Depression eased , the government phased out many of these programs .	0	government
 6956 . Some people in the United States argue that the self - monitoring and self - regulating incentives provided by the existence of private goods mean that sound public policy requires very little government action .	0	government
 Known as libertarians , these individuals believe government almost always operates less efficiently than the private sector ( the segment of the economy run for profit and not under government control ) , and that government actions should therefore be kept to a minimum .	1	government
 6959 . By the beginning of the twentieth century , led by the Progressives , the United States had begun to search for ways to govern large businesses that had managed to distort market forces by monopolizing the supply of goods .	0	government
 And , largely as a result of the Great Depression , people wanted ways of developing and protecting public goods that were fairer and more equitable than had existed before .	0	government
 These forces and events led to the increased regulation of public and common goods , and a move for the public sector — the government — to take over of the provision of many toll goods .	0	government
 6962 . However , in 1928 , Senator Hiram Johnson and Representative Phil Swing , both Republicans from California , won the day .	0	government
 Congress passed the Boulder Canyon Project Act , authorizing the construction of one of the most ambitious engineering feats in U.S. history .	0	government

 This work and others like it helped to spur the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act ( 1906 ) and ultimately led to the creation of government agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA).http://www.fda.gov / AboutFDA / WhatWeDo / History/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 The nation ’s experiences during the depression of 1896 and the Great Depression of the 1930s also led to more robust regulatory policies designed to improve the transparency of financial markets and prevent monopolies from forming .	0	government
 6968 . By the 1960s , social welfare had become a major function of the federal government — one to which most public policy funds are devoted — and had developed to serve several overlapping functions .	0	government
 First , social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of equity in a democratic political system based on competitive , free - market economics .	1	government
 During the Great Depression , many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low - income levels plaguing society could threaten the stability of democracy , as was happening in European countries like Germany and Italy .	0	government
 6971 . Social Security addresses these concerns with three important tools .	0	government
 First and best known is the retirement benefit .	0	government
 6974 . While Social Security was designed to provide cash payments to sustain the aged and disabled , Medicare and Medicaid were intended to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to health care .	0	government
 Medicare , like Social Security , is an entitlement program funded through payroll taxes .	0	government
 Its purpose is to make sure that senior citizens and retirees have access to low - cost health care they might not otherwise have , because most U.S. citizens get their health insurance through their employers .	0	government
 6977 . One of the reasons the news media are so enduring is that citizens have a range of opinions on public policy , and they are very interested in debating how a given change would improve their lives or the country ’s .	0	government
 But despite their interests , most people do little more than vote or occasionally contribute to a political campaign .	0	government
 A few people , however , become policy advocates by actively working to propose or maintain public policy .	0	government
 6980 . Both the Congress and the president have tried to reduce the bias in policy analysis by creating their own theoretically nonpartisan policy branches .	0	government
 In Congress , the best known of these is the Congressional Budget Office , or CBO .	0	government
 Authorized in the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act , the CBO was formally created in 1975 as a way of increasing Congress ’s independence from the executive branch .	0	government
 6983 . On a national level , policy implementation can be either top - down or bottom - up .	0	government
 In top - down implementation , the federal government dictates the specifics of the policy , and each state implements it the same exact way .	1	government
 In bottom - up implementation , the federal government allows local areas some flexibility to meet their specific challenges and needs . Daniel Mazmanian and Paul Sabatier .	1	government
 6986 . Finally , laissez - faire proponents felt that keeping government out of the business of business would create an automatic cycle of economic growth and contraction .	0	government
 Contraction phases in which there is no economic growth for two consecutive quarters , called recessions , would bring business failures and higher unemployment .	1	government
 But this condition , they believed , would correct itself on its own if the government simply allowed the system to operate .	0	government
 6989 . The desire of Keynesians to create a minimal level of aggregate demand , coupled with a Depression - era preference to promote social welfare policy , led the president and Congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into two broad categories : mandatory and discretionary ( see [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Of these , mandatory spending is the larger , consisting of about $ 2.3 trillion of the projected 2015 budget , or roughly 57 percent of all federal expenditures.“Mandatory Spending in 2015 : An Infographic , ” 6 January 2016 . www.cbo.gov/publication/51111 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6992 . However , the amount of money the U.S. government needed to borrow to pay its bills in 2016 was still in excess of $ 400 billion“The Federal Budget in 2015 : An Infographic , ” 6 January 2016 . www.cbo.gov/publication/51110 ( March 1 , 2016 ) . .	0	government
 This was in addition to the country ’s almost $ 19 trillion of total debt — the amount of money the government owes its creditors — at the end of 2015 , according to the Department of the Treasury .	0	government
 6995 . This does not automatically mean the wealthy pay less than the poor , simply that the percentage of their income they pay in taxes will be lower .	0	government
 Consider , for example , the use of excise taxes on specific goods or services as a source of revenue.“Excise tax , ” https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Excise-Tax ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Sometimes called “ sin taxes ” because they tend to be applied to goods like alcohol , tobacco , and gasoline , excise taxes have a regressive quality , since the amount of the good purchased by the consumer , and thus the tax paid , does not increase at the same rate as income .	0	government
 A person who makes $ 250,000 per year is likely to purchase more gasoline than a person who makes $ 50,000 per year ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 7001 . A third main goal is the preservation of a balance of power in the world .	0	government
 A balance of power means no one nation or region is much more powerful militarily than are the countries of the rest of the world .	1	government
 The achievement of a perfect balance of power is probably not possible , but general stability , or predictability in the operation of governments , strong institutions , and the absence of violence within and between nations may be .	0	government
 7004 . The United Nations ( UN ) is perhaps the foremost international organization in the world today .	0	government
 The main institutional bodies of the UN are the General Assembly and the Security Council .	0	government
 7007 . Another cross - national organization to which the United States is tied , and that exists to forcefully represent Western allies and in turn forge the peace , is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) .	0	government
 NATO was formed after World War II as the Cold War between East and West started to emerge .	0	government
 7010 . At times the United States has been free trade – oriented , while at other times it has been protectionist .	0	government
 Perhaps its most free trade – oriented move was the 1991 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .	0	government
 This pact removed trade barriers and other transaction costs levied on goods moving between the United States , Mexico , and Canada .	1	government
 7013 . Had they not succeeded , an escalating set of options likely would have included diplomatic sanctions ( removal of ambassadors ) , economic sanctions ( such as an embargo on trade and the flow of money between the countries ) , minor military options ( such as establishment of a no - fly zone just outside Chinese airspace ) , or more significant military options ( such as a focused campaign to enter China and get the pilots back ) .	1	government

 1212 . The inorganic material of soil consists of rock , slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size .	0	biology
 Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand .	1	biology
 Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .	1	biology
 1215 . Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers ; together , the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile .	1	biology
 Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .	0	biology
 1218 . The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .	1	biology
 Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .	1	biology
 Other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere , such as sand and glacial drift .	0	biology
 1221 . Topsoil is rich in organic material ; microbial processes occur there , and it is the “ workhorse ” of plant production .	1	biology
 The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering , and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil .	1	biology
 This horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter .	0	biology
 1224 . Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .	1	biology
 This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase .	0	biology
 1230 . An insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects .	0	biology
 The Venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition , and has leaves that work as traps ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1236 . The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther .	0	biology
 In a plant ’s male reproductive organs , development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The microsporangia , which are usually bi - lobed , are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains .	1	biology
 1245 . The female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls ( [ link ] ) are present .	0	biology
 In the female cone , megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium .	0	biology
 1248 . Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 Self - pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time , and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower ’s stigma .	0	biology
 1251 . Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 After fertilization is complete , no other sperm can enter .	0	biology
 1254 . The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots .	0	biology
 In monocots , such as corn and wheat , the single cotyledon is called a scutellum ; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue ( xylem and phloem ) .	1	biology
 Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .	0	biology
 1257 . Tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) , tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) , and pepper ( Capsicum annuum ) are examples of endospermic dicots .	0	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization , but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage .	0	biology
 The two halves of a peanut seed ( Arachis hypogaea ) and the split peas ( Pisum sativum ) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves .	0	biology
 1260 . The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 In dicots , the hypocotyls extend above ground , giving rise to the stem of the plant .	0	biology
 1266 . Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings .	0	biology
 Some seeds require vernalization ( cold treatment ) before they can germinate .	1	biology
 This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring .	0	biology
 1269 . If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .	1	biology
 1272 . Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .	1	biology
 Together , all three are known as the pericarp .	0	biology
 1275 . Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses , citrus species , and other plants .	0	biology
 In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .	0	biology
 The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .	1	biology
 1278 . Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil .	1	biology
 Young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred .	0	biology
 1281 . Soon after flowering , these plants die .	0	biology
 Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime .	1	biology
 Fruit trees , such as apple and orange trees , are polycarpic ; they flower every year .	0	biology
 1284 . Limits on Animal Size and ShapeAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape : this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends .	1	biology
 This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds .	0	biology
 1287 . The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat .	0	biology
 1293 . A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 1302 . Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide : they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer , and are most commonly found in a single - layer arrangement .	1	biology
 The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1305 . Connective TissuesConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non - living substance , called the ground substance .	1	biology
 The ground substance is made of an organic substance ( usually a protein ) and an inorganic substance ( usually a mineral or water ) .	1	biology
 1308 . Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material .	1	biology
 The fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel .	0	biology
 1311 . The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	0	biology
 1314 . The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	0	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 Over time , these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient .	0	biology
 1317 . Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop .	0	biology
 It may either increase or decrease the stimulus , but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it .	0	biology
 1320 . Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system .	1	biology
 This is called acclimatization .	0	biology
 This occurs , for instance , when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to .	0	biology
 1323 . Carnivores are animals that eat other animals .	1	biology
 The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “ meat eater . ” Wild cats such as lions , shown in [ link]a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores , as are snakes and sharks , while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars , spiders , and ladybugs , shown in [ link]b .	0	biology
 1326 . The alimentary canal , shown in [ link]b , is a more advanced system : it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other .	1	biology
 Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal .	0	biology
 1329 . Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows , sheep , and goats , whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber .	1	biology
 They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose .	0	biology
 1332 . The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food .	0	biology
 The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing .	0	biology
 The tongue helps in swallowing — moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx .	0	biology
 1335 . A ring - like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system .	1	biology
 The gastro - esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus .	0	biology
 1338 . Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes .	0	biology
 The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme .	1	biology
 Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine .	0	biology
 1341 . The human small intestine is over 6 m long and is divided into three parts : the duodenum , the jejunum , and the ileum .	1	biology
 The “ C - shaped , ” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum .	1	biology
 1344 . Here , hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining .	0	biology
 The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum . The ileum , also illustrated in [ link ] is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream .	1	biology
 The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle .	0	biology
 1347 . The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination .	0	biology
 The anus is an opening at the far - end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material .	1	biology
 Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination : the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary .	0	biology
 1350 . The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts .	1	biology
 When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum , the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum .	0	biology
 1353 . Both fat - soluble and water - soluble vitamins must be obtained from food .	0	biology
 Minerals , listed in [ link ] , are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food .	1	biology
 Among their many functions , minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co - factors .	0	biology
 1356 . Pancreatic juices also contain amylase , which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose , a disaccharide .	1	biology
 The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases , sucrases , and lactases , which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall .	0	biology
 Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose .	0	biology
 1359 . The long - chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides , which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins .	1	biology
 These large spheres are called chylomicrons .	0	biology
 Chylomicrons contain triglycerides , cholesterol , and other lipids and have proteins on their surface .	0	biology
 1362 . The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions .	0	biology
 This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying .	0	biology
 1365 . Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 However , when the stomach is emptied , the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid .	0	biology
 This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism .	0	biology
 1368 . Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest .	0	biology
 A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed .	1	biology
 1371 . Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body .	0	biology
 The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .	1	biology
 An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .	1	biology
 1374 . Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath .	1	biology
 These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon .	0	biology
 1377 . Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	0	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .	1	biology
 1380 . This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .	1	biology
 1383 . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter .	0	biology
 Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential .	1	biology
 When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .	0	biology
 1386 . As K+ ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative .	0	biology
 The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell 's normal resting potential .	1	biology
 At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential .	0	biology
 1389 . Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft , the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 1392 . Signal SummationSometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential .	1	biology
 This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .	0	biology
 1395 . The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .	1	biology
 The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .	0	biology
 1398 . The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 1401 . It includes the cerebral cortex , limbic system , basal ganglia , thalamus , hypothalamus , and cerebellum .	0	biology
 There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures : a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in [ link]b , a coronal section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in [ link]a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . Cerebral CortexThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex , which is folded into hills called gyri ( singular : gyrus ) and valleys called sulci ( singular : sulcus ) .	1	biology
 The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .	0	biology
 1404 . The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain .	0	biology
 Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .	0	biology
 1407 . The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .	1	biology
 It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .	1	biology
 1410 . The thalamus ( Greek for “ inner chamber ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] , acts as a gateway to and from the cortex .	1	biology
 It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex .	0	biology
 1413 . It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala ( Greek for “ almond ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .	0	biology
 1416 . The brainstem , illustrated in [ link ] , connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord .	1	biology
 It consists of the midbrain , medulla oblongata , and the pons .	0	biology
 1419 . The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation .	1	biology
 One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake ( “ snake ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) .	0	biology
 1422 . While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and digest . ” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic , the parasympathetic nervous system is in control ( “ picnic ” and “ parasympathetic ” both start with “ p ” ) .	1	biology
 Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1425 . Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death .	1	biology
 These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die .	0	biology
 1428 . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder .	1	biology
 Its severity differs from person to person .	0	biology
 1431 . Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders .	1	biology
 To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder , a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed , changes in appetite and sleep schedules , difficulty concentrating , feelings of worthlessness , and suicidal thoughts .	0	biology
 1434 . Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	1	biology
 This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .	0	biology
 In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .	0	biology
 1437 . The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’s receptive field .	1	biology
 Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses .	0	biology
 1440 . Perception is an individual ’s interpretation of a sensation .	1	biology
 Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors , perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor , but at higher levels in the nervous system , in the brain .	0	biology
 1443 . Meissner ’s corpuscles , ( shown in [ link ] ) also known as tactile corpuscles , are found in the upper dermis , but they project into the epidermis .	1	biology
 They , too , are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids .	0	biology
 1446 . Neurons are not physically connected , but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or “ gaps ” between communicating neurons .	0	biology
 Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .	1	biology
 Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .	1	biology
 1449 . Audition , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions .	1	biology
 It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an approaching predator , and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating .	0	biology
 1452 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	0	biology
 1455 . The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear .	0	biology
 The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .	1	biology
 The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .	1	biology
 1458 . The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1461 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	1	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	0	biology
 The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 .	0	biology
 1464 . Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity , or brightness .	0	biology
 The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela , which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle .	1	biology
 1467 . The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 In conditions of high ambient light , the iris contracts , reducing the size of the pupil at its center .	0	biology
 1470 . For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina .	1	biology
 In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear .	0	biology
 1473 . Both rods and cones contain photopigments .	0	biology
 In vertebrates , the main photopigment , rhodopsin , has two main parts [ link ] ) : an opsin , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a cluster of α - helices that span the membrane ) , and retinal — a molecule that absorbs light .	1	biology
 When light hits a photoreceptor , it causes a shape change in the retinal , altering its structure from a bent ( cis ) form of the molecule to its linear ( trans ) isomer .	0	biology
 1476 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	0	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .	1	biology
 1479 . The first four tastes need little explanation .	0	biology
 The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later .	0	biology
 The taste of umami , also known as savoriness , is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L - glutamate .	1	biology
 1482 . Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 An olfactory receptor , which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron , responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain .	1	biology
 Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors , distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors .	0	biology
 1485 . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud .	1	biology
 A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 There are several structurally distinct papillae .	0	biology
 1488 . Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones .	1	biology
 1491 . The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain ( chain of amino acids ) .	0	biology
 The peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains , such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 1494 . In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1497 . In this way , nothing passes through the cell membrane ; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell .	0	biology
 The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger , which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1500 . In this way , a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product .	0	biology
 To stop hormone activity , cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase , or PDE .	0	biology
 PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity , preventing overproduction of cellular products . The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm .	1	biology
 1503 . In some cases , the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones , which is referred to as neural stimuli .	1	biology
 Recall that in a short - term stress response , the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond .	0	biology
 1506 . The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release - inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus , and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1509 . The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 It is a part of the brain , extending down from the hypothalamus , and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells , which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary .	1	biology
 5 . Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy , biology , computer sciences , geology , logic , physics , chemistry , and mathematics ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 However , those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences .	1	biology
 Thus , a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above .	0	biology
 8 . In deductive reason , the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning .	0	biology
 Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results .	1	biology
 From those general principles , a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid .	0	biology
 11 . Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls .	0	biology
 A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment .	1	biology
 The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about .	1	biology
 14 . In contrast , applied science or “ technology , ” aims to use science to solve real - world problems , making it possible , for example , to improve a crop yield , find a cure for a particular disease , or save animals threatened by a natural disaster ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In applied science , the problem is usually defined for the researcher .	0	biology
 17 . This structure is sometimes called the “ IMRaD ” format .	0	biology
 There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an abstract ( a concise summary ) at the beginning of the paper . There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published ; for example , some review papers require an outline .	1	biology
 20 . The materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used , and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data .	0	biology
 The description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results , but it does not have to be verbose .	0	biology
 23 . Finally , the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings .	1	biology
 While the scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated , any good research should lead to more questions .	0	biology
 29 . Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes ; these are called organelles .	1	biology
 Organelles are small structures that exist within cells .	0	biology
 32 . In larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions .	1	biology
 Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function .	1	biology
 35 . For instance , the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs ; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels .	1	biology
 Organisms are individual living entities .	1	biology
 For example , each tree in a forest is an organism .	0	biology
 41 . The evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both .	1	biology
 A phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches .	0	biology
 44 . Another field of biological study , neurobiology , studies the biology of the nervous system , and although it is considered a branch of biology , it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience .	1	biology
 Because of its interdisciplinary nature , this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular , cellular , developmental , medical , and computational approaches .	0	biology
 50 . An atom is composed of two regions : the nucleus , which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons , and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Atoms contain protons , electrons , and neutrons , among other subatomic particles .	0	biology
 53 . Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons .	0	biology
 The number of protons determines an element ’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .	1	biology
 The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .	0	biology
 56 . IsotopesIsotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons .	1	biology
 Some elements — such as carbon , potassium , and uranium — have naturally occurring isotopes .	0	biology
 59 . The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature : they may be gases , solids , or liquids .	0	biology
 Elements also have specific chemical reactivity , the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other .	1	biology
 62 . The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons .	0	biology
 This is known as the octet rule , which states , with the exception of the innermost shell , that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell , the outermost electron shell .	1	biology
 Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 68 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	1	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	0	biology
 71 . Even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules ( each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom ) , in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds : they contain atoms of more than one type of element .	1	biology
 Molecular oxygen , on the other hand , as shown in [ link],consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule . The oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are joined by a double bond .	0	biology
 74 . In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .	1	biology
 This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs — a state called equilibrium .	1	biology
 These situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products .	0	biology
 77 . Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .	1	biology
 Anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in “ -ide ” : the anion of chlorine is called chloride , and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide , for example .	0	biology
 80 . Certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes ( including sodium , potassium , and calcium ) , ions necessary for nerve impulse conduction , muscle contractions and water balance .	1	biology
 Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise .	0	biology
 83 . This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’s electrons .	0	biology
 Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively .	0	biology
 Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus .	0	biology
 86 . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination .	0	biology
 Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules .	1	biology
 Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities , which are not always symmetrical around an atom .	0	biology
 89 . Water ’s high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen bonding among water molecules .	0	biology
 Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids .	0	biology
 Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 92 . Eventually , as water reaches its boiling point of 100 ° Celsius ( 212 ° Fahrenheit ) , the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules , and the kinetic energy ( motion ) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas .	0	biology
 Even when below its boiling point , water ’s individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize : this process is known as evaporation .	1	biology
 95 . Before it overflows , the water forms a dome - like shape above the rim of the glass .	0	biology
 This water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion .	0	biology
 In cohesion , water molecules are attracted to each other ( because of hydrogen bonding ) , keeping the molecules together at the liquid - gas ( water - air ) interface , although there is no more room in the glass .	1	biology
 98 . This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it .	1	biology
 This type of adhesion is called capillary action , and is illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 104 . Cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids ( RNA and DNA ) , carbohydrates , and lipids .	0	biology
 The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules ( any carbon - containing liquid , solid , or gas ) that are especially important for life .	1	biology
 The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon .	0	biology
 107 . So far , the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons , which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 Another type of hydrocarbon , aromatic hydrocarbons , consists of closed rings of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 Ring structures are found in hydrocarbons , sometimes with the presence of double bonds , which can be seen by comparing the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in [ link ] .	0	biology
 110 . Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	0	biology
 For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans . Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds .	0	biology
 In the simple molecule butene ( C4H8 ) , the two methyl groups ( CH3 ) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule , as illustrated in [ link ] b .	0	biology
 113 . This carbon backbone is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen .	0	biology
 Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons .	1	biology
 116 . Most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called monomers .	1	biology
 The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers .	1	biology
 In doing so , monomers release water molecules as byproducts .	0	biology
 119 . Carbohydrates are , in fact , an essential part of our diet ; grains , fruits , and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates .	0	biology
 Carbohydrates provide energy to the body , particularly through glucose , a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods .	0	biology
 Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans , animals , and plants .	0	biology
 122 . Disaccharides ( di- = “ two ” ) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction ( also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis ) .	1	biology
 During this process , the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide , releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond .	0	biology
 128 . Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature .	0	biology
 This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon – carbon or carbon – hydrogen bonds .	0	biology
 131 . When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond , the fatty acid is said to be unsaturated .	1	biology
 Oleic acid is an example of an unsaturated fatty acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 134 . Wax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants .	0	biology
 Because of the hydrophobic nature of waxes , they prevent water from sticking on the surface ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 137 . Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules .	1	biology
 Proteins may be structural , regulatory , contractile , or protective ; they may serve in transport , storage , or membranes ; or they may be toxins or enzymes .	0	biology
 140 . Protein shape is critical to its function , and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds .	0	biology
 Changes in temperature , pH , and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein , leading to loss of function , known as denaturation .	1	biology
 All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids .	0	biology
 143 . The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure .	1	biology
 For example , the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains , A and B , and they are linked together by disulfide bonds .	0	biology
 146 . The unique three - dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain .	0	biology
 149 . Nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life .	0	biology
 They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell .	1	biology
 155 . The primary structure of a purine is two carbon - nitrogen rings .	0	biology
 Cytosine , thymine , and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon - nitrogen ring as their primary structure ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each of these basic carbon - nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it .	0	biology
 161 . To give you a sense of cell size , a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers ( abbreviated as eight μm ) in diameter ; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter ( two mm ) in diameter .	0	biology
 That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin . Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 Visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen .	1	biology

 A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate - containing group .	1	biology
 170 . Typically , the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The nucleus ( plural = nuclei ) houses the cell ’s DNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins .	1	biology
 Let ’s look at it in more detail ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 173 . Chromatin and ChromosomesTo understand chromatin , it is helpful to first consider chromosomes .	0	biology
 Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA , the hereditary material .	1	biology
 You may remember that in prokaryotes , DNA is organized into a single circular chromosome .	0	biology
 176 . Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis .	1	biology
 When viewed through an electron microscope , ribosomes appear either as clusters ( polyribosomes ) or single , tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 185 . If you look at [ link]b , you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell .	0	biology
 The central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell ’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions .	1	biology
 Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days , it wilts ?	0	biology
 188 . Intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement .	0	biology
 Their function is purely structural .	0	biology
 191 . When present , the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella .	0	biology
 When cilia ( singular = cilium ) are present , however , many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 They are short , hair - like structures that are used to move entire cells ( such as paramecia ) or substances along the outer surface of the cell ( for example , the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus , or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils .	1	biology
 194 . A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The cells are held tightly against each other by proteins ( predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins).Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells .	0	biology
 197 . The explanation proposed by Singer and Nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model .	0	biology
 The model has evolved somewhat over time , but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them .	0	biology

 Hydrophobic , or water - hating molecules , tend to be non - polar .	0	biology
 They interact with other non - polar molecules in chemical reactions , but generally do not interact with polar molecules .	1	biology
 203 . Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes , attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipids .	1	biology
 Peripheral proteins , along with integral proteins , may serve as enzymes , as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton , or as part of the cell ’s recognition sites .	0	biology
 206 . In passive transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration .	1	biology
 A physical space in which there is a range of concentrations of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient .	1	biology
 209 . Facilitated transportIn facilitated transport , also called facilitated diffusion , materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins .	1	biology
 A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy .	0	biology
 212 . Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell .	0	biology
 Aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate .	1	biology
 215 . Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same , but there are different concentrations of a dissolved substance , or solute , that can not cross the membrane ( otherwise the concentrations on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane ) .	0	biology
 If the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same , but the concentrations of solute are different , then there are different amounts of water , the solvent , on either side of the membrane .	0	biology
 218 . Three terms — hypotonic , isotonic , and hypertonic — are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells .	0	biology
 In a hypotonic situation , the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell , and water enters the cell .	1	biology
 ( In living systems , the point of reference is always the cytoplasm , so the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes , or a lower osmolarity , than the cell cytoplasm . )	0	biology
 221 . However , the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 This is called plasmolysis .	0	biology
 Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt ( [ link]).The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the tonicity of the solution that it is bathed in .	0	biology
 224 . This energy is harvested from ATP generated through the cell ’s metabolism .	0	biology
 Active transport mechanisms , collectively called pumps , work against electrochemical gradients .	1	biology
 Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes .	0	biology
 227 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 230 . A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	0	biology
 An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules , but in different directions .	0	biology
 All of these transporters can also transport small , uncharged organic molecules like glucose .	0	biology
 233 . In preparation for phagocytosis , a portion of the inward - facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin , which stabilizes this section of the membrane .	0	biology
 The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle , eventually enclosing it .	0	biology
 236 . A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis .	0	biology
 This process uses a coating protein , called caveolin , on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , which performs a similar function to clathrin .	0	biology
 The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin .	0	biology
 239 . Scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow ( [ link ] ) through living systems , such as cells .	0	biology
 Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions .	0	biology
 242 . The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP , 36 to 38 molecules .	0	biology
 This is a catabolic pathway .	0	biology
 Catabolic pathways involve the degradation ( or breakdown ) of complex molecules into simpler ones .	1	biology
 245 . The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings , the less ordered and more random the system is .	0	biology
 Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy .	1	biology
 High entropy means high disorder and low energy ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 248 . This is because these bonds can release energy when broken .	0	biology
 The type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds , and is released when those bonds are broken , is called chemical energy ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food .	0	biology
 251 . A negative ∆G also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants , because they gave off some free energy during the reaction .	0	biology
 Reactions that have a negative ∆G and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions .	1	biology
 Think : exergonic means energy is exiting the system .	1	biology
 254 . A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state .	0	biology
 This contorted state is called the transition state , and it is a high - energy , unstable state .	0	biology
 For this reason , reactant molecules do n’t last long in their transition state , but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction .	0	biology
 257 . However , not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high - energy state .	0	biology
 Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high - energy bonds ( phosphoanhydride bonds ) that , when broken , release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes .	1	biology
 These high - energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third ( or beta and gamma ) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups .	0	biology
 260 . However , increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates .	0	biology
 High temperatures will eventually cause enzymes , like other biological molecules , to denature , a process that changes the natural properties of a substance .	1	biology
 Likewise , the pH of the local environment can also affect enzyme function .	0	biology
 263 . Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate .	1	biology
 This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide , meaning that they have more than one protein subunit .	0	biology
 266 . An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound , and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction .	1	biology
 Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together , these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions , or redox reactions . Electrons and Energy	0	biology
 269 . A phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway , and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available ADP molecule , producing ATP ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This very direct method of phosphorylation is called substrate - level phosphorylation .	0	biology
 272 . You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar , glucose .	0	biology
 Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism .	1	biology
 Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism .	0	biology
 275 . In the second step of glycolysis , an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers , fructose-6-phosphate .	0	biology
 An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers .	1	biology
 ( This change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three - carbon molecules .	0	biology
 278 . In the presence of oxygen , acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl group to a four - carbon molecule , oxaloacetate , to form citrate , a six - carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups ; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule .	1	biology
 This single pathway is called by different names : the citric acid cycle ( for the first intermediate formed — citric acid , or citrate — when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate ) , the TCA cycle ( since citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids ) , and the Krebs cycle , after Hans Krebs , who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles .	0	biology
 281 . The rough endoplasmic reticulum ( RER ) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 284 . FMN , which is derived from vitamin B2 , also called riboflavin , is one of several prosthetic groups or co - factors in the electron transport chain .	0	biology
 A prosthetic group is a non - protein molecule required for the activity of a protein .	1	biology
 Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic , non - peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function ; prosthetic groups include co - enzymes , which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes .	1	biology
 287 . Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor .	0	biology
 Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation .	1	biology
 In contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor .	0	biology
 290 . Because they use light to manufacture their own food , they are called photoautotrophs ( literally , “ self - feeders using light ” ) .	1	biology
 Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .	1	biology
 A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as chemoautotrophs .	1	biology
 293 . The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll .	0	biology
 The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance .	1	biology
 The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss .	0	biology
 296 . Within the chloroplast are stacked , disc - shaped structures called thylakoids .	0	biology
 Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .	1	biology
 The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .	0	biology
 299 . Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages : the light - dependent reactions and the light independent - reactions .	0	biology
 In the light - dependent reactions , energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy .	1	biology
 In the light - independent reactions , the chemical energy harvested during the light - dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide .	1	biology

 This test goes back to the New York Times v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) case , in which a police commissioner in Alabama sued over inaccurate statements in a newspaper advertisement . New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) .	0	government
 Because the commissioner was a public figure , the U.S. Supreme Court applied a stringent test of malice to determine whether the advertisement was libel ; the court deemed it was not .	0	government
 6434 . In 1971 , the Supreme Court heard the Pentagon Papers case , in which the U.S. government sued the New York Times and the Washington Post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the Vietnam War .	1	government
 The Supreme Court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media , meaning the government can prevent the publication of information , that right is very limited .	0	government
 The court gave the newspapers the right to publish much of the study , but revelation of troop movements and the names of undercover operatives are some of the few approved reasons for which the government can stop publication or reporting .	0	government
 6437 . The Communications Act of 1934 replaced the Radio Act and created a more powerful entity to monitor the airwaves — a seven - member Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to oversee both radio and telephone communication .	1	government
 The FCC , which now has only five members ( [ link ] ) , requires radio stations to apply for licenses , granted only if stations follow rules about limiting advertising , providing a public forum for discussion , and serving local and minority communities .	0	government

 6467 . Why do we have two parties ?	0	government
 The two - party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections , with one seat tied to a geographic district , tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties .	0	government
 Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office .	0	government
 6470 . Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .	0	government
 In 1860 , four candidates competed for the presidency : Lincoln , a Republican ; two Democrats , one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party , a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery .	0	government
 6473 . Abandoning plurality voting , even if the winner - take - all election were kept , would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose .	0	government
 The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme , in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters .	1	government
 If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top contenders .	0	government
 6476 . Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the Electoral College , demobilized ethnicity , and campaign and election laws .	0	government
 First , the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College .	0	government
 6479 . One of the best - known party realignments occurred when Democrats moved to include African Americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the Great Depression .	0	government
 After the Civil War , Republicans , the party of Lincoln , were viewed as the party that had freed the slaves .	0	government
 6482 . Roosevelt won the election with almost 58 percent of the popular vote and 472 Electoral College votes , compared to incumbent Herbert Hoover ’s 59 .	0	government
 The 1932 election is considered an example of a critical election , one that represents a sudden , clear , and long - term shift in voter allegiances .	1	government
 After this election , the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members’ socio - economic status .	0	government
 6485 . They are part of what is known as the party organization .	0	government
 The party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates .	1	government
 It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “ brand . ” It also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office .	0	government
 6488 . First , many Americans , especially young people , are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level .	0	government
 According to John Green of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics , “ Local elections tend to be about things like sewers , and roads and police protection — which are not as dramatic an issue as same - sex marriage or global warming or international affairs.”Elizabeth Lehman , “ Trend Shows Generation Focuses Mostly on Social , National Issues , ” http://www.thenewsoutlet.org/survey-local-millennials-more-interested-in-big-issues/ ( March 15 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Presidential elections and the behavior of the U.S. Congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners , and the national - level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level .	0	government
 The national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the House and Senate .	0	government
 6491 . One of the first challenges facing the party - in - government , or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals .	1	government
 The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties ; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses .	1	government
 6494 . Key benefits like committee appointments , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party .	0	government
 These pressures are particularly acute for the majority party , so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers .	1	government
 The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote .	0	government
 6497 . For the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government , the threat it posed to the government appears to have been muted by a high degree of bipartisanship , or cooperation through compromise .	1	government
 Many pieces of legislation were passed in the 1960s and 1970s with reasonably high levels of support from both parties .	0	government
 6500 . Movements on the left have also arisen .	0	government
 The Occupy Wall Street movement was born of the government ’s response to the Great Recession of 2008 and its assistance to endangered financial institutions , provided through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , TARP ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 The Occupy Movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry .	0	government
 6503 . Several conflicting theories have been offered .	0	government
 The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position . Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 .	0	government
 According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns .	0	government
 Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics .	0	government
 6506 . Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	1	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government
 6509 . According to political scientist Nolan McCarty , there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone .	0	government

 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , by November 2015 , thirty - six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls.http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx ( November 78 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights .	0	government
 This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) .	0	government
 6545 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .	0	government
 Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .	1	government
 These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement .	0	government
 6548 . Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems .	0	government
 For instance , political scientist Robert Salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals . Robert Salisbury , “ An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups , ” Midwest Journal of Political Science 13 ( 1969 ) : 1–32 ; Peter B. Clark and James Q. Wilson , “ Incentive Systems : A Theory of Organizations , ” Administration Science Quarterly 6 ( 1961 ) : 129–166 .	0	government
 Some offer material incentives , which are tangible benefits of joining a group .	1	government
 AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .	0	government
 1951 . 6554 .	0	government
 Rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances .	0	government
 When , during his presidential candidacy , Donald Trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many rallied both for and against him . Jenna Johnson , “ Immigration continues to be Donald Trump ’s rallying issue , ” Washington Post , 22 October 2015 , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/immigration-continues-to-be-donald-trumps-rallying-issue/.Protestors take to the streets on different sides of the immigration issue .	0	government
 Some argue that the United States is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration .	0	government
 6557 . Joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community .	0	government
 Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level .	1	government
 Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .	0	government
 6560 . On the other hand , stem cell research is highly salient to members of the American Neurological Association , an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists .	0	government
 Accordingly , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community , but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs .	0	government
 Such was also the case when several unions split from the AFL - CIO ( American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , the nation ’s largest federation of unions , in 2005.Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Interest Groups in the States , ” 1991 , 1996 , 1999 , 2004 ; Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Nationalization of Interest Groups and Lobbying in the States . ” Improved technology and the development of social media have made it easier for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members .	0	government
 6563 . However , not all scholars accept the premise that mobilization is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision - makers .	0	government
 The elite critique suggests that certain interests , typically businesses and the wealthy , are advantaged and that policies more often reflect their wishes than anyone else ’s .	1	government

 In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court upheld Congress ’s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates .	1	government
 However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .	0	government
 In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .	1	government
 6572 . Some continued to argue that campaign expenditures are a form of speech , a position with which two recent Supreme Court decisions are consistent .	0	government
 The Citizens United v. Federal Election CommissionCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 08 - 205 , 558 U.S. 310 ( 2010 ) .	0	government
 and the McCutcheon v. Federal Election CommissionMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , 12 - 536 , 572 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections .	0	government
 Citizens United overturned the soft money ban of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections .	1	government
 6575 . While the Supreme Court has paved the way for increased spending in politics , lobbying is still regulated in many ways . Adam J. Newmark , “ Measuring State Legislative Lobbying Regulation , 1990–2003 . ” State Politics and Policy Quarterly 5 ( 2005 ) : 182–191 ; Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ” The 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act defined who can and can not lobby , and requires lobbyists and interest groups to register with the federal government . Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .	0	government
 The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 further increased restrictions on lobbying .	0	government
 For example , the act prohibited contact between members of Congress and lobbyists who were the spouses of other Congress members .	0	government
 6578 . States deep in debt were printing increasingly worthless paper currency , many were mired in interstate trade battles with each other , and in western Massachusetts , a small group of Revolutionary War veterans angry over the prospect of losing their farms broke into armed open revolt against the state , in what came to be known as Shays’ Rebellion .	1	government
 The conclusion many reached was that the Articles of Confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together .	0	government
 In the spring of 1787 , a convention was called , and delegates from all the states ( except Rhode Island , which boycotted the convention ) were sent to Philadelphia to hammer out a solution to this central problem .	0	government
 6581 . The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .	0	government
 The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .	1	government
 The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .	0	government
 6584 . Congressional apportionment today is achieved through the equal proportions method , which uses a mathematical formula to allocate seats based on U.S. Census Bureau population data , gathered every ten years as required by the Constitution .	1	government
 At the close of the first U.S. Congress in 1791 , there were sixty - five representatives , each representing approximately thirty thousand citizens .	0	government
 6587 . While the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals , nearly quintupling the number of African American representatives in Congress in just over two decades , they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice , gerrymandering .	0	government
 Gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate .	1	government
 6590 . An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .	1	government
 In this section , we will learn about each type of power and the foundations of legitimacy they claim .	0	government
 6593 . But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	0	government
 Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .	0	government
 When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .	0	government
 6596 . But presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the expense of the Congress .	0	government
 By the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and Congress least powerful .	0	government
 For example , President Abraham Lincoln , who oversaw the prosecution of the Civil War , stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states.“Abraham Lincoln : Impact and Legacy , ” http://millercenter.org­/president/biography/lincoln-impact-and-legacy ( May 24 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6599 . Following the twin scandals of Vietnam and Watergate in the early 1970s , Congress attempted to assert itself as a coequal branch , even in creating foreign policy , but could not hold back the trend .	0	government
 The War Powers Resolution ( covered in the foreign policy chapter ) was intended to strengthen congressional war powers but ended up clarifying presidential authority in the first sixty days of a military conflict .	0	government
 The war on terrorism after 9/11 has also strengthened the president ’s hand .	0	government
 6602 . Another important reform occurred in 2002 , when Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russell Feingold ( D - WI ) drafted , and Congress passed , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain - Feingold Act .	0	government
 The purpose of this law was to limit the use of “ soft money , ” which is raised for purposes like party - building efforts , get - out - the - vote efforts , and issue - advocacy ads .	1	government
 6605 . In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .	0	government
 A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .	1	government
 Such PACs tended to be run by businesses and other groups , like the Teamsters Union and the National Rifle Association , to support their special interests .	0	government
 6608 . Despite the power of the conferences , however , the most important leadership position in the House is actually elected by the entire body of representatives .	0	government
 This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .	0	government
 The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty - four Speakers have been .	0	government
 6611 . However , the majority rules the day in the House , like a cartel .	0	government
 On the majority side , because it holds the speakership , the majority leader also has considerable power .	0	government
 Historically , moreover , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current Speaker steps down .	0	government
 6614 . There are well over two hundred committees , subcommittees , select committees , and joint committees in the Congress .	0	government
 The core committees are called standing committees .	1	government
 There are twenty standing committees in the House and sixteen in the Senate ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6617 . In 2016 , Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa ( a ) , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , despite the urging of his committee colleagues .	0	government
 In the meantime , Garland met with numerous senators , such as Republican Susan Collins of Maine ( b ) .	0	government
 6620 . Once hearings have been completed , the bill enters the markup stage .	0	government
 This is essentially an amending and voting process .	1	government
 6623 . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .	0	government
 This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government
 6626 . In a defining moment for the filibuster , Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for twenty - four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in 1957 .	0	government
 A vocal proponent of segregation and white supremacy , Thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform .	0	government
 6629 . Some interests groups form political action committees ( PACs ) , groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues .	1	government
 As [ link ] makes apparent , many large corporations like Honeywell International , AT&T , and Lockheed Martin form PACs to distribute money to candidates.https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Other PACs are either politically or ideologically oriented .	0	government
 6632 . For example , a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti - tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation .	0	government
 Prior to the election in 2012 , political activist Grover Norquist , the founder of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , asked all Republican members of Congress to sign a “ Taxpayer Protection Pledge ” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts .	0	government
 Ninety - five percent of the Republicans in Congress signed the pledge . Sean Lengell , “ Boehner : Grover Norquist Just a ‘ Random’ Guy , ” Washington Times , 3 November 2011 , http://www.washingtontimes.com / blog / inside - politics/2011/nov/3/boehner - grover - norquist - just - random - guy/ .	0	government
 Some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives .	0	government
 6635 . They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress .	0	government
 This is the delegate model of representation .	0	government
 6638 . Instead , proper representation for some is rooted in the racial , ethnic , socioeconomic , gender , and sexual identity of the representatives themselves .	1	government
 This form of representation is called descriptive representation .	0	government
 6641 . The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .	1	government
 For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .	0	government
 Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth , when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska .	0	government
 6644 . And as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with addressing those constituents’ interests .	0	government
 Historically , this job has included what some have affectionately called “ bringing home the bacon ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call pork - barrel politics .	0	government
 As a term and a practice , pork - barrel politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward .	1	government
 6647 . Indeed , when the ratings are graphed , the two noticeable peaks are at 57 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2001 ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In 1998 , according to Gallup polling , the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures , including President Bill Clinton ’s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy .	0	government
" In 2001 , approval spiked after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Bush administration launched the "" War on Terror , "" sending troops first to Afghanistan and later to Iraq ."	0	government
 6650 . The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .	0	government
 The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .	0	government
 He proposed that Congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely undefined .	0	government
 6653 . By early September , the Electoral College had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection .	0	government
 This process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections .	0	government
 6656 . This should have meant that Texas ’s 32 electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other .	0	government
 Cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in Wyoming , where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier . Alan Clendenning , “ Court : Cheney Is Wyoming Resident , ” ABC News , 7 December 2000 , http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122289&page=1 ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It ’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was , but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution , that was a real possibility .	0	government
 6659 . An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive — impeachment .	0	government
 Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing ; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors .	1	government
 6662 . The most recent impeachment was of President Bill Clinton , brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .	0	government
 House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton ’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment .	0	government
 6665 . Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers .	0	government
 Some waged undeclared wars , as John Adams did against the French in the Quasi - War ( 1798–1800 ) .	0	government
 Others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains , as Thomas Jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of Louisiana from France .	0	government
 6668 . James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	1	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States .	0	government
 6671 . He then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending U.S. troops to the Rio Grande , the border Texan expansionists claimed for Texas .	0	government
 Mexico sent troops in response , and the Mexican - American War began soon afterward . Fred Greenstein .	0	government
 2010 . 6674 .	0	government
 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government
 He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .	0	government
 His successor , Andrew Johnson , became so embroiled with Radical Republicans about ways to implement Reconstruction policies and programs after the Civil War that the House of Representatives impeached him , although the legislators in the Senate were unable to successfully remove him from office . Michael Les Benedict .	0	government
 6677 . Constitution , Article II , Section 1 .	0	government
 As the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .	0	government
 Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege , the right to withhold information from Congress , the judiciary , or the public .	1	government
 This right , not enumerated in the Constitution , was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch . Mark J. Rozel .	0	government
 6680 . Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized , amended , and approved by Congress .	0	government
 However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 6683 . Following the first election of Washington , the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process , creating separate nomination and general election stages .	0	government
 Early on , the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus .	0	government
 The caucus or large - scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties .	1	government
 6686 . The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars’ control of the process of candidate selection .	0	government
 Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote .	0	government
 6689 . When Washington declined to run again after two terms , matters worsened .	0	government
 In 1796 , political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively .	0	government
 Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams ’s administration , much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello .	0	government
 6692 . Following the 2000 presidential election , when then - governor George W. Bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger , astonished voters called for Electoral College reform .	0	government
 Years later , however , nothing of any significance had been done .	0	government
 1989 . 6698 .	0	government
 The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .	0	government
 Instead , however , Senator Ted Cruz used the confirmation hearing to question the Vietnam War hero ’s patriotism .	0	government
 Hagel was eventually confirmed by a 58–41 vote .	0	government
 6701 . When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .	0	government
 Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .	0	government
 6704 . But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that ’s inclined to obstruct .	0	government
 Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments , respectively .	0	government
 President Obama has made far fewer recess appointments ; as of May 1 , 2015 , he had made only thirty - two . Bruce Drake , “ Obama lags his predecessors in recess appointments , ” 13 January 2014 , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/obama-lags-his-predecessors-in-recess-appointments/ ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , the pro forma session .	0	government
 6707 . Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration , often with a sharp edge .	0	government
 Richard Nixon ’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example .	0	government
 But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .	0	government
 6710 . In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .	0	government
 Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .	0	government
 President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure .	0	government
 0 . What is biology ?	0	biology
 In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments .	1	biology
 This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast .	0	biology
 3 . The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments .	0	biology
 A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested .	1	biology
 Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is .	0	biology
 6 . For some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics .	0	biology
 Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry .	1	biology
 Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary .	0	biology
 9 . Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science .	0	biology
 Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested . The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches .	1	biology
 18 . The introduction starts with brief , but broad , background information about what is known in the field .	1	biology
 A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work ; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented .	0	biology
 21 . Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both .	0	biology
 If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections , the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation .	1	biology
 The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .	0	biology
 27 . Atoms form molecules .	0	biology
 A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .	1	biology
 Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .	1	biology
 30 . Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts , which carry out indispensable functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars .	0	biology
 All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms .	1	biology
 ( This requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells .	0	biology
 33 . In larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions .	1	biology
 Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function .	1	biology
 Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .	0	biology
 36 . All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population .	1	biology
 For example , a forest may include many pine trees .	0	biology
 39 . An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic , non - living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water .	1	biology
 At the highest level of organization ( [ link ] ) , the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems , and it represents the zones of life on earth .	1	biology
 It includes land , water , and even the atmosphere to a certain extent . Art ConnectionThe biological levels of organization of living things are shown .	0	biology
 42 . Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field .	0	biology
 For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .	0	biology
 Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .	1	biology
 45 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .	0	biology
 48 . Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass .	1	biology
 Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions .	1	biology
 There are 118 elements , but only 92 occur naturally .	0	biology
 51 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge .	0	biology
 A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged .	0	biology
 Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .	0	biology
 54 . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .	0	biology
 Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number .	0	biology
 63 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms .	0	biology
 Their non - reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases ( or noble gases ) .	0	biology
 Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left - hand column .	0	biology
 66 . Two electrons fill the 1s orbital , and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital .	0	biology
 Its electron configuration is 1s22s1 .	0	biology
 Neon ( Ne ) , on the other hand , has a total of ten electrons : two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell ( two each in the 2s and three p orbitals ) ; thus , it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms .	0	biology
 69 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	0	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	1	biology
 An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction ; this direction is not always a “ one - way street . ” For the creation of the water molecule shown above , the chemical equation would be :	0	biology
 72 . Some chemical reactions , such as the one shown above , can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up .	0	biology
 The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .	0	biology
 Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .	0	biology
 78 . This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer .	1	biology
 As [ link ] illustrates , sodium ( Na ) only has one electron in its outer electron shell .	0	biology
 84 . Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally .	1	biology
 For example , molecular oxygen ( O2 ) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms .	0	biology
 87 . Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions .	0	biology
 A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -philic = “ loving ” ) .	1	biology
 In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .	0	biology
 90 . Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 For water , this amount is one calorie .	0	biology
 It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool .	0	biology
 93 . Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it .	0	biology
 Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds .	1	biology
 The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .	0	biology
 96 . Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress .	1	biology
 This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity .	0	biology
 99 . litmus or pH paper , filter paper that has been treated with a natural water - soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator , to test how much acid ( acidity ) or base ( alkalinity ) exists in a solution .	1	biology
 You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated .	0	biology
 102 . The pH scale is , as previously mentioned , an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Anything below 7.0 ( ranging from 0.0 to 6.9 ) is acidic , and anything above 7.0 ( from 7.1 to 14.0 ) is alkaline .	0	biology
 105 . Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen , such as methane ( CH4 ) described above .	1	biology
 We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels — like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter .	0	biology
 108 . The three - dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry .	0	biology
 Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .	1	biology
 Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	1	biology
 111 . Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three - dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images .	1	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , an amino acid alanine example , the two structures are non - superimposable .	0	biology
 114 . As you ’ve learned , biological macromolecules are large molecules , necessary for life , that are built from smaller organic molecules .	1	biology
 There are four major classes of biological macromolecules ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids ) ; each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions .	0	biology
 120 . Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula ( CH2O)n , where n is the number of carbons in the molecule .	0	biology
 In other words , the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules .	0	biology
 126 . Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer .	1	biology
 The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose ; this provides structural support to the cell .	0	biology
 129 . The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar .	0	biology
 Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure .	0	biology
 Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .	0	biology
 132 . Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond .	0	biology
 If hydrogens are present in the same plane , it is referred to as a cis fat ; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes , it is referred to as a trans fat .	0	biology
 The cis double bond causes a bend or a “ kink ” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly , keeping them liquid at room temperature ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 135 . Phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane , the outermost layer of animal cells .	1	biology
 Like fats , they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone .	0	biology
 141 . Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins .	1	biology
 Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure , which consists of a central carbon atom , also known as the alpha ( α ) carbon , bonded to an amino group ( NH2 ) , a carboxyl group ( COOH ) , and to a hydrogen atom .	0	biology
 144 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .	0	biology
 The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 147 . In nature , some proteins are formed from several polypeptides , also known as subunits , and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure .	0	biology
 Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure .	0	biology
 150 . The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .	0	biology
 DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms , ranging from single - celled bacteria to multicellular mammals .	1	biology
 153 . DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides .	0	biology
 The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide , DNA or RNA .	0	biology
 Each nucleotide is made up of three components : a nitrogenous base , a pentose ( five - carbon ) sugar , and a phosphate group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 156 . The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ ( 1′ is read as “ one prime ” ) .	0	biology
 The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide , which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage .	0	biology
 The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules : its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups .	0	biology
 159 . As you have learned , information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein .	0	biology
 DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription , and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation .	1	biology
 This is known as the Central Dogma of Life , which holds true for all organisms ; however , exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections .	0	biology
 162 . In contrast to light microscopes , electron microscopes ( [ link]b ) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light .	1	biology
 Not only does this allow for higher magnification and , thus , more detail ( [ link ] ) , it also provides higher resolving power .	0	biology
 165 . We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes .	0	biology
 Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of the cell : the nucleoid ( [ link]).This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell .	1	biology
 All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid , ribosomes , a cell membrane , and a cell wall .	0	biology
 168 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .	1	biology
 It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 171 . The nuclear envelope is a double - membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers .	0	biology
 174 . When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle , proteins are attached to chromosomes , and they resemble an unwound , jumbled bunch of threads .	0	biology
 These unwound protein - chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( [ link ] ) ; chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed .	1	biology
 177 . Mitochondria ( singular = mitochondrion ) are often called the “ powerhouses ” or “ energy factories ” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the cell ’s main energy - carrying molecule .	0	biology
 ATP represents the short - term stored energy of the cell .	1	biology
 180 . The centrosome is a microtubule - organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells .	1	biology
 It contains a pair of centrioles , two structures that lie perpendicular to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 183 . Like the mitochondria , chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes , but chloroplasts have an entirely different function .	0	biology
 Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis .	1	biology
 Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide , water , and light energy to make glucose and oxygen .	1	biology
 186 . Within the cytoplasm , there would still be ions and organic molecules , plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell , secure some organelles in specific positions , allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell , and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move .	1	biology
 Collectively , this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton : microfilaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 189 . The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of α - tubulin and β - tubulin , two globular proteins ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 With a diameter of about 25 nm , microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 They help the cell resist compression , provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell , and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell .	0	biology
 192 . Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate - containing protein molecules called proteoglycans .	1	biology
 Collectively , these materials are called the extracellular matrix ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue , but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other .	0	biology
 195 . Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes , which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes .	1	biology
 198 . The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid .	0	biology
 Carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins , forming glycoproteins , or attached to lipids , forming glycolipids .	0	biology
 201 . The head can form hydrogen bonds , but the tail can not .	0	biology
 A molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged , or non - polar , area is referred to as amphiphilic or “ dual - loving . ”	1	biology
 204 . Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell , and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving .	0	biology
 In other words , plasma membranes are selectively permeable — they allow some substances to pass through , but not others .	1	biology
 If they were to lose this selectivity , the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself , and it would be destroyed .	0	biology
 207 . Diffusion is a passive process of transport .	1	biology
 A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space .	0	biology
 210 . The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins , and they function as either channels for the material or carriers .	1	biology
 In both cases , they are transmembrane proteins .	0	biology
 213 . Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein .	0	biology
 This aptly named protein binds a substance and , in doing so , triggers a change of its own shape , moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ( [ link ] ) ; depending on the gradient , the material may move in the opposite direction .	0	biology
 216 . Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis .	1	biology
 A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .	0	biology
 219 . As for a hypertonic solution , the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does .	1	biology
 Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell .	0	biology
 222 . Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .	1	biology
 If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance .	0	biology
 225 . Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules .	0	biology
 Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .	1	biology
 Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .	0	biology
 228 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	1	biology
 231 . This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process .	0	biology
 The sodium - potassium pump is , therefore , an electrogenic pump ( a pump that creates a charge imbalance ) , creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential .	1	biology
 234 . A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis .	0	biology
 This literally means “ cell drinking ” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid .	0	biology
 237 . In receptor - mediated endocytosis , as in phagocytosis , clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor - mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective , the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood .	0	biology
 240 . Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used , cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy - requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place .	0	biology
 All of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells , including those that use energy and those that release energy , are the cell ’s metabolism .	1	biology
 243 . Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter .	1	biology
 The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system , and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings .	0	biology
 246 . However , a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work .	0	biology
 Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy .	1	biology
 A speeding bullet , a walking person , the rapid movement of molecules in the air ( which produces heat ) , and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy .	0	biology
 249 . How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction ?	0	biology
 A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers .	0	biology
 Free energy is called Gibbs free energy ( abbreviated with the letter G ) after Josiah Willard Gibbs , the scientist who developed the measurement .	0	biology
 252 . Thus , the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy - storing molecules .	0	biology
 These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions , and they are non - spontaneous .	1	biology
 An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy .	0	biology
 255 . The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings .	0	biology
 Heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) speeds up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they collide ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their transition state .	1	biology
 For this reason , heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently .	0	biology
 258 . The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme ’s substrates .	1	biology
 There may be one or more substrates , depending on the particular chemical reaction .	0	biology
 261 . This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step .	0	biology
 However , current research supports a more refined view called induced fit ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The induced - fit model expands upon the lock - and - key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate .	1	biology
 264 . Many enzymes do n’t work optimally , or even at all , unless bound to other specific non - protein helper molecules , either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds .	0	biology
 Two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes .	0	biology
 Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes .	0	biology
 267 . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable .	0	biology
 The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP , a process called dephosphorylation , releases energy .	1	biology
 270 . Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism , however , is derived from a much more complex process , chemiosmosis , which takes place in mitochondria ( [ link ] ) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell .	0	biology
 Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .	1	biology
 The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .	0	biology
 273 . Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism .	0	biology
 The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic .	1	biology
 Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells .	0	biology
 276 . If the cell can not catabolize the pyruvate molecules further , it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose .	0	biology
 Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration — the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen — and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP .	1	biology
 If glycolysis is interrupted , these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium - potassium pumps , and eventually , they die .	0	biology
 279 . As the protein passes along the Golgi ’s cisternae , it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates .	0	biology
 After its synthesis is complete , it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the Golgi ’s trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane .	0	biology

 282 . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( SER ) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates , lipids , and steroid hormones ; detoxification of medications and poisons ; and storage of calcium ions .	0	biology
 285 . Complex II directly receives FADH2 , which does not pass through complex I .	0	biology
 The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone ( Q ) .	1	biology
 The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane .	0	biology
 288 . In contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor .	0	biology
 Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen .	0	biology
 291 . Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .	1	biology
 A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as chemoautotrophs .	1	biology
 294 . The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss .	0	biology
 Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes . In all autotrophic eukaryotes , photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast .	0	biology
 For plants , chloroplast - containing cells exist in the mesophyll .	0	biology
 297 . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .	1	biology
 The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .	0	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis).Art Connection	1	biology
 2420 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform .	0	history
 Some authors , such as Jack London , who wrote The Call of the Wild , embraced a school of thought called naturalism , which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity ( [ link]).Jack London poses with his dog Rollo in 1885 ( a ) .	1	history
 The cover of Jack London ’s The Call of the Wild ( b ) shows the dogs in the brutal environment of the Klondike .	0	history
 2423 . The campaign was a typical one for the era : Democrats shone a spotlight on earlier Republican scandals , such as the Crédit Mobilier affair , and Republicans relied upon the bloody shirt campaign , reminding the nation of the terrible human toll of the war against southern confederates who now reappeared in national politics under the mantle of the Democratic Party .	1	history
 President Grant previously had great success with the “ bloody shirt ” strategy in the 1868 election , when Republican supporters attacked Democratic candidate Horatio Seymour for his sympathy with New York City draft rioters during the war .	0	history
 2426 . With his efforts towards ensuring African American civil rights stymied by a Democratic Congress , and his decision to halt the coinage of silver merely adding to the pressures of the economic Panic of 1873 , Hayes failed to achieve any significant legislation during his presidency .	0	history
 However , he did make a few overtures towards civil service reform .	0	history
 2429 . At the state level , specifically in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Illinois , and Iowa , the Patrons of Husbandry did briefly succeed in urging the passage of Granger Laws , which regulated some railroad rates along with the prices charged by grain elevator operators .	1	history
 The movement also created a political party — the Greenback Party , so named for its support of print currency ( or “ greenbacks ” ) not based upon a gold standard — which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen . However , such successes were short - lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers .	1	history
 2432 . The causes of the Depression of 1893 were manifold , but one major element was the speculation in railroads over the previous decades .	0	history
 The rapid proliferation of railroad lines created a false impression of growth for the economy as a whole .	0	history
 2435 . Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century , these Progressive journalists sought to expose critical social problems and exhort the public to take action .	0	history
 In his book , How the Other Half Lives ( 1890 ) , journalist and photographer Jacob Riis used photojournalism to capture the dismal and dangerous living conditions in working - class tenements in New York City ( [ link ] ) .	0	history

 2441 . During his time as governor , from 1901 through 1906 , La Follette introduced the Wisconsin Idea , wherein he hired experts to research and advise him in drafting legislation to improve conditions in his state .	1	history
 “ Fighting Bob ” supported numerous Progressive ideas while governor : He signed into law the first workman ’s compensation system , approved a minimum wage law , developed a progressive tax law , adopted the direct election of U.S. senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory , and advocated for women ’s suffrage .	0	history
 La Follette subsequently served as a popular U.S. senator from Wisconsin from 1906 through 1925 , and ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket in 1924.An energetic speaker and tireless Progressive , Governor Robert “ Fighting Bob ” La Follette turned the state of Wisconsin into a flagship for democratic reform .	0	history
 2444 . When others in the group were unwilling to move in her direction , Paul split from the NAWSA to create the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage , later renamed the National Woman ’s Party , in 1913 .	0	history
 Known as the Silent Sentinels ( [ link ] ) , Paul and her group picketed outside the White House for nearly two years , starting in 1917 .	0	history
 In the latter stages of their protests , many women , including Paul , were arrested and thrown in jail , where they staged a hunger strike as self - proclaimed political prisoners .	0	history
 2447 . Du Bois , met in a small hotel on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls — where segregation laws did not bar them from hotel accommodations — to discuss what immediate steps were needed for equal rights ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Du Bois , a professor at the all - black Atlanta University and the first African American with a doctorate from Harvard , emerged as the prominent spokesperson for what would later be dubbed the Niagara Movement .	0	history
 By 1905 , he had grown wary of Booker T. Washington ’s calls for African Americans to accommodate white racism and focus solely on self - improvement .	0	history
 2450 . The new president ’s background suggested he would be a strong administrator .	0	history
 He had previously served as the governor of the Philippines following the Spanish - American War , had a distinguished judicial career , and served as Roosevelt ’s Secretary of War from 1904 to 1908 .	0	history
 Republican leaders , however , were anxious to reestablish tighter control over the party after Roosevelt ’s departure , and they left Taft little room to maneuver .	0	history
 2453 . Wilson described his more moderate approach as one of New Freedom , which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks .	0	history
 Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of New Nationalism , a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests .	1	history
 He sought to capitalize on the stewardship approach that he had made famous during his previous administration .	0	history
 2456 . Turner ( [ link ] ) and naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan were instrumental in the country ’s move toward foreign expansion , and writer Brooks Adams further dramatized the consequences of the nation ’s loss of its frontier in his The Law of Civilization and Decay in 1895 .	0	history
 As mentioned in the chapter opening , Turner announced his Frontier Thesis — that American democracy was largely formed by the American frontier — at the Chicago World ’s Colombian Exposition .	1	history
 He noted that “ for nearly three centuries the dominant fact in American life has been expansion . ” He continued : “ American energy will continually demand a wider field for its exercise . ”	0	history
 2459 . Although they initially met with little Spanish resistance , by early July , fierce battles ensued near the Spanish stronghold in Santiago .	0	history
 Most famously , Theodore Roosevelt led his Rough Riders , an all - volunteer cavalry unit made up of adventure - seeking college graduates , and veterans and cowboys from the Southwest , in a charge up Kettle Hill , next to San Juan Hill , which resulted in American forces surrounding Santiago .	1	history
 The victories of the Rough Riders are the best known part of the battles , but in fact , several African American regiments , made up of veteran soldiers , were instrumental to their success .	0	history
 2462 . In 1899 , Secretary of State Hay made a bold move to acquire China ’s vast markets for American access by introducing Open Door notes , a series of circular notes that Hay himself drafted as an expression of U.S. interests in the region and sent to the other competing powers ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 These notes , if agreed to by the other five nations maintaining spheres of influences in China , would erase all spheres and essentially open all doors to free trade , with no special tariffs or transportation controls that would give unfair advantages to one country over another .	0	history
 2465 . When William Howard Taft became president in 1909 , he chose to adapt Roosevelt ’s foreign policy philosophy to one that reflected American economic power at the time .	0	history
 In what became known as “ dollar diplomacy , ” Taft announced his decision to “ substitute dollars for bullets ” in an effort to use foreign policy to secure markets and opportunities for American businessmen ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Not unlike Roosevelt ’s threat of force , Taft used the threat of American economic clout to coerce countries into agreements to benefit the United States .	0	history

 British intelligence intercepted and decoded a top - secret telegram from German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann to the German ambassador to Mexico , instructing the latter to invite Mexico to join the war effort on the German side , should the United States declare war on Germany .	1	history
 2471 . The court ruled that during a time of war , the federal government was justified in passing such laws to quiet dissenters .	0	history
 The decision was unanimous , and in the court ’s opinion , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that such dissent presented a “ clear and present danger ” to the safety of the United States and the military , and was therefore justified .	0	history
 He further explained how the First Amendment right of free speech did not protect such dissent , in the same manner that a citizen could not be freely permitted to yell “ fire ! ” in a crowded theater , due to the danger it presented .	0	history
 2474 . Prohibition , as the anti - alcohol movement became known , had been a goal of many Progressives for decades .	1	history
 Organizations such as the Women ’s Christian Temperance Union and the Anti - Saloon League linked alcohol consumption with any number of societal problems , and they had worked tirelessly with municipalities and counties to limit or prohibit alcohol on a local scale .	0	history
 2477 . But on the other side of the political spectrum , interventionists argued that Article X would impede the United States from using her rightfully attained military power to secure and protect America ’s international interests . Wilson ’s greatest fight was with the Senate , where most Republicans opposed the treaty due to the clauses surrounding the creation of the League of Nations .	0	history
 Some Republicans , known as Irreconcilables , opposed the treaty on all grounds , whereas others , called Reservationists , would support the treaty if sufficient amendments were introduced that could eliminate Article X .	1	history
 In an effort to turn public support into a weapon against those in opposition , Wilson embarked on a cross - country railway speaking tour .	0	history
 2480 . But in the 1910s , as major filmmakers like D. W. Griffith looked to escape the cost of Edison ’s patents on camera equipment , this began to change .	0	history
 When Griffith filmed In Old California ( 1910 ) , the first movie ever shot in Hollywood , California , the small town north of Los Angeles was little more than a village .	1	history
 As moviemakers flocked to southern California , not least because of its favorable climate and predictable sunshine , Hollywood swelled with moviemaking activity .	0	history
 2483 . Ford even bought a plot of land in the Amazonian jungle twice the size of Delaware to build a factory town he called Fordlandia .	0	history
 Workers there rejected his midwestern Puritanism even more than his factory discipline , and the project ended in an epic failure .	0	history
 2486 . Town leaders in Dayton , Tennessee , for their part , sensed an opportunity to promote their town , which had lost more than one - third of its population , and welcomed the ACLU to stage a test case against the Butler Act .	0	history
 The ACLU and the town got their wish as the Scopes Monkey Trial , as the newspapers publicized it , quickly turned into a carnival that captured the attention of the country and epitomized the nation ’s urban / rural divide ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2489 . The new Negro found political expression in a political ideology that celebrated African Americans distinct national identity .	0	history
 This Negro nationalism , as some referred to it , proposed that African Americans had a distinct and separate national heritage that should inspire pride and a sense of community .	1	history
 An early proponent of such nationalism was W. E. B .	0	history
 2492 . They felt alienated from society , so they tried to escape ( some literally ) to criticize it .	0	history
 Many lived an expatriate life in Paris for the decade , although others went to Rome or Berlin .	0	history
 2495 . Herbert Hoover became president at a time of ongoing prosperity in the country .	0	history

 2498 . On Black Tuesday , October 29 , stock holders traded over sixteen million shares and lost over $ 14 billion in wealth in a single day .	1	history
 To put this in context , a trading day of three million shares was considered a busy day on the stock market .	0	history
 2501 . Hoover believed strongly in the ethos of American individualism : that hard work brought its own rewards .	0	history
 His life story testified to that belief .	0	history
 2504 . One of the most notable protest movements occurred toward the end of Hoover ’s presidency and centered on the Bonus Expeditionary Force , or Bonus Army , in the spring of 1932 .	0	history

 2507 . In hard - hit Oklahoma , thousands of farmers packed up what they could and walked or drove away from the land they thought would be their future .	1	history
 They , along with other displaced farmers from throughout the Great Plains , became known as Okies .	0	history
 Okies were an emblem of the failure of the American breadbasket to deliver on its promise , and their story was made famous in John Steinbeck ’s novel , The Grapes of Wrath .	0	history
 2510 . As a result , the global depression worsened further .	0	history
 A similar attempt to spur the world economy , known as the Hoover Moratorium , likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit .	0	history

 2516 . Within forty - eight hours of his inauguration , Roosevelt proclaimed an official bank holiday and called Congress into a special session to address the crisis .	0	history
 The resulting Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was signed into law on March 9 , 1933 , a scant eight hours after Congress first saw it .	0	history
 The law officially took the country off the gold standard , a restrictive practice that , although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe , severely limited the circulation of paper money .	1	history
 2525 . The biggest threat to the president , however , came from corrupt but beloved Louisiana senator Huey “ Kingfish ” Long ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 His disapproval of Roosevelt came in part from his own ambitions for higher office ; Long stated that the president was not doing enough to help people and proposed his own Share Our Wealth program .	0	history
 2528 . With the implementation of the Second New Deal , Roosevelt also created the country ’s present - day social safety net .	0	history
 The Social Security Act established programs intended to help the most vulnerable : the elderly , the unemployed , the disabled , and the young .	1	history
 It included a pension fund for all retired people — except domestic workers and farmers , which therefore left many women and African Americans beyond the scope of its benefits — over the age of sixty - five , to be paid through a payroll tax on both employee and employer .	0	history
 2531 . Within his White House , Roosevelt had a number of African American appointees , although most were in minor positions .	0	history
 Unofficially , Roosevelt relied upon advice from the Federal Council on Negro Affairs , also known as his “ Black Cabinet . ” This group included a young Harvard economist , Dr. Robert Weaver , who subsequently became the nation ’s first black cabinet secretary in 1966 , as President Lyndon Johnson ’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development .	0	history
 Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .	0	history
 2534 . In 1919 , Mussolini created the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento ( Italian Combat Squadron ) .	1	history
 The organization ’s main tenets of Fascism called for a totalitarian form of government and a heightened focus on national unity , militarism , social Darwinism , and loyalty to the state .	1	history
 With the support of major Italian industrialists and the king , who saw Fascism as a bulwark against growing Socialist and Communist movements , Mussolini became prime minister in 1922 .	0	history
 2537 . By the end of the war , however , manpower needs resulted in African American recruits serving in the infantry and flying planes .	0	history
 The Tuskegee Institute in Alabama had instituted a civilian pilot training program for aspiring African American pilots .	0	history
 When the war began , the Department of War absorbed the program and adapted it to train combat pilots .	0	history
 2540 . Still , there was some resistance to women going to work in such a male - dominated environment .	0	history
 In order to recruit women for factory jobs , the government created a propaganda campaign centered on a now - iconic figure known as Rosie the Riveter ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Rosie , who was a composite based on several real women , was most famously depicted by American illustrator Norman Rockwell .	0	history
 2543 . Japanese Americans also suffered from discrimination .	0	history
 The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .	0	history
 Executive Order 9066 , signed by Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , gave the army power to remove people from “ military areas ” to prevent sabotage or espionage .	1	history

 A huge mushroom cloud rose above the city .	0	history
 2552 . Kennedy ’s various aid projects , like the Peace Corps , fit closely with his administration ’s flexible response , which Robert McNamara advocated as a better alternative to the all - or - nothing defensive strategy of mutually assured destruction favored during Eisenhower ’s presidency .	0	history
 The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .	0	history
 2555 . Organized in 1960 , SDS held its first meeting at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .	0	history
 Its philosophy was expressed in its manifesto , the Port Huron Statement , written by Tom Hayden and adopted in 1962 , affirming the group ’s dedication to fighting economic inequality and discrimination .	0	history
 It called for greater participation in the democratic process by ordinary people , advocated civil disobedience , and rejected the anti - Communist position held by most other groups committed to social reform in the United States .	1	history
 2558 . This act provided increased federal funding to both elementary and secondary schools , allocating more than $ 1 billion for the purchase of books and library materials , and the creation of educational programs for disadvantaged children .	0	history
 The Higher Education Act , signed into law the same year , provided scholarships and low - interest loans for the poor , increased federal funding for colleges and universities , and created a corps of teachers to serve schools in impoverished areas .	1	history
 2561 . Within the chorus of voices calling for integration and legal equality were many that more stridently demanded empowerment and thus supported Black Power .	0	history
 Black Power meant a variety of things .	0	history
 2564 . Well before the end of the war , Congress had passed one of the most significant and far - reaching pieces of legislation to ease veterans’ transition into civilian life : the Servicemen ’s Readjustment Act , also known as the GI Bill ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Every honorably discharged veteran who had seen active duty , but not necessarily combat , was eligible to receive a year ’s worth of unemployment compensation .	1	history
 2573 . As a result of these conditions , Communism was making significant inroads in both Italy and France .	0	history
 These concerns led Truman , along with Secretary of State George C. Marshall , to propose to Congress the European Recovery Program , popularly known as the Marshall Plan .	0	history
 Between its implantation in April 1948 and its termination in 1951 , this program gave $ 13 billion in economic aid to European nations .	0	history

 The new community was named Levittown .	0	history
 2582 . In the late 1940s , some white country musicians began to experiment with the rhythms of the blues , a decades - old musical genre of rural southern blacks .	1	history
 This experimentation led to the creation of a new musical form known as rockabilly , and by the 1950s , rockabilly had developed into rock and roll .	0	history
 Rock and roll music celebrated themes such as young love and freedom from the oppression of middle - class society .	1	history
 2588 . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , many young people came to embrace a new wave of cultural dissent .	1	history
 The counterculture offered an alternative to the bland homogeneity of American middle - class life , patriarchal family structures , self - discipline , unquestioning patriotism , and the acquisition of property .	0	history
 In fact , there were many alternative cultures .	0	history
 2591 . Although Goldwater lost the 1964 election , his vigorous rejection of New Deal state and social legislation , along with his support of states’ rights , proved popular in the Deep South , which had resisted federal efforts at racial integration .	0	history
 Taking a lesson from Goldwater ’s experience , Nixon also employed a southern strategy in 1968 .	0	history
 Denouncing segregation and the denial of the vote to African Americans , he nevertheless maintained that southern states be allowed to pursue racial equality at their own pace and criticized forced integration .	0	history
 2597 . Continuing his strategy of pitting one Communist nation against another , in May 1972 , Nixon made another newsworthy trip , traveling to Moscow to meet with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev .	0	history
 The two discussed a policy of détente , a relaxation of tensions between their nations , and signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty ( SALT ) , which limited each side to deploying only two antiballistic missile systems .	1	history
 It also limited the number of nuclear missiles maintained by each country .	0	history
 2600 . But Nixon ’s victory was short - lived , however , for it was soon discovered that he and members of his administration had routinely engaged in unethical and illegal behavior during his first term .	0	history
 Following the publication of the Pentagon Papers , for instance , the “ plumbers , ” a group of men used by the White House to spy on the president ’s opponents and stop leaks to the press , broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg ’s psychiatrist to steal Ellsberg ’s file and learn information that might damage his reputation .	1	history
 2603 . In 1979 , Carter sought to reassure the nation and the rest of the world , especially the Soviet Union , that the United States was still able to defend its interests .	0	history

 2606 . While many suffered , others prospered .	0	history
 The 1970s had been the era of the hippie , and Newsweek magazine declared 1984 to be the “ year of the Yuppie . ” Yuppies , whose name derived from “ ( y)oung , ( u)rban ( p)rofessionals , ” were akin to hippies in being young people whose interests , values , and lifestyle influenced American culture , economy , and politics , just as the hippies’ credo had done in the late 1960s and 1970s .	1	history
 Unlike hippies , however , yuppies were materialistic and obsessed with image , comfort , and economic prosperity .	0	history
 2609 . Concern over a decline in the country ’s moral values welled up on both sides of the political aisle .	0	history
 In 1985 , anxiety over the messages of the music industry led to the founding of the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) , a bipartisan group formed by the wives of prominent Washington politicians including Susan Baker , the wife of Reagan ’s treasury secretary , James Baker , and Tipper Gore , the wife of then - senator Al Gore , who later became vice president under Bill Clinton .	1	history

 He entered the White House a “ cold warrior ” and referred to the Soviet Union in a 1983 speech as an “ evil empire . ” Dedicated to upholding even authoritarian governments in foreign countries to keep them safe from Soviet influence , he was also desperate to put to rest Vietnam Syndrome , the reluctance to use military force in foreign countries for fear of embarrassing defeat , which had influenced U.S. foreign policy since the mid-1970s .	1	history
 2615 . Wary of not having sufficient domestic support for combat , Bush first deployed troops to the area to build up forces in the region and defend Saudi Arabia via Operation Desert Shield ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 On January 14 , Bush succeeded in getting resolutions from Congress authorizing the use of military force against Iraq , and the U.S. then orchestrated an effective air campaign , followed by Operation Desert Storm , a one - hundred - hour land war involving over 500,000 U.S. troops and another 200,000 from twenty - seven other countries , which expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait by the end of February .	1	history
 2618 . With 49 percent of the popular vote and 379 electoral votes , he became the first Democrat to win reelection to the presidency since Franklin Roosevelt .	0	history
 Clinton ’s victory was partly due to a significant gender gap between the parties , with women tending to favor Democratic candidates .	0	history

 2621 . Three days later , Congress issued a joint resolution authorizing the president to use all means necessary against the individuals , organizations , or nations involved in the attacks .	0	history
 On September 20 , in an address to a joint session of Congress , Bush declared war on terrorism , blamed al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the attacks , and demanded that the radical Islamic fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan , the Taliban , turn bin Laden over or face attack by the United States .	0	history
 This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .	1	history
 2624 . The more militant side won , and the argument for war was gradually laid out for the American people .	0	history
 The immediate impetus to the invasion , it argued , was the fear that Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) : nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons capable of wreaking great havoc .	1	history
 Hussein had in fact used WMDs against Iranian forces during his war with Iran in the 1980s , and against the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988—a time when the United States actively supported the Iraqi dictator .	0	history
 2627 . The second proposed solution was to give students the opportunity to attend schools with better performance records .	0	history
 Some of these might be charter schools , institutions funded by local tax monies in much the same way as public schools , but able to accept private donations and exempt from some of the rules public schools must follow .	1	history
 During the administration of George H. W. Bush , the development of charter schools had gathered momentum , and the American Federation of Teachers welcomed them as places to employ innovative teaching methods or offer specialized instruction in particular subjects .	0	history
 2630 . Once they had purchased the loans , larger investment banks bundled them into huge packages known as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and sold them to investors around the world .	0	history

 2633 . In the 1990s , the idea of legal , same - sex marriage seemed particularly unlikely ; neither of the two main political parties expressed support for it .	0	history
 Things began to change , however , following Vermont ’s decision to allow same - sex couples to form state - recognized civil unions in which they could enjoy all the legal rights and privileges of marriage .	0	history
 Although it was the intention of the state to create a type of legal relationship equivalent to marriage , it did not use the word “ marriage ” to describe it .	0	history
 1516 . The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks .	0	biology
 These layers form three distinct regions : an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids , a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids , and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens .	0	biology
 1519 . The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans , as visible in the micrograph shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin .	0	biology
 1522 . While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands , the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function .	0	biology
 Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone .	0	biology
 1528 . As blood osmolarity decreases , a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus , and ADH secretion is reduced .	0	biology
 ADH release can be reduced by certain substances , including alcohol , which can cause increased urine production and dehydration . Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus .	0	biology
 If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH , water can not be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine .	0	biology
 1534 . FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin , which is released by the testes .	0	biology
 LH stimulates production of the sex hormones ( androgens ) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell - stimulating hormone .	0	biology
 1537 . Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .	0	biology
 PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .	0	biology
 The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks .	0	biology
 1540 . This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .	0	biology
 This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells , causing high levels of blood glucose , or hyperglycemia ( high sugar ) .	1	biology
 High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine , resulting in glucose being lost in urine .	0	biology
 1543 . When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .	0	biology
 Glucagon raises blood glucose levels , eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect , by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis .	1	biology
 Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells .	0	biology
 1546 . T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .	0	biology
 1549 . Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones .	0	biology
 Hypothyroidism , underproduction of the thyroid hormones , can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain , sensitivity to cold , and reduced mental activity , among other symptoms .	1	biology
 In children , hypothyroidism can cause cretinism , which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects .	0	biology
 1552 . The hormone calcitonin , which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid , has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does PTH .	0	biology
 Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts , stimulating osteoblasts , and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys .	1	biology
 1555 . Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs .	0	biology
 The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus . The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin - like growth factors ( IGFs ) or somatomedins , which are a family of growth - promoting proteins produced by the liver , which stimulates tissue growth .	1	biology
 IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood , allowing the formation of new proteins , particularly in skeletal muscle cells , cartilage cells , and other target cells , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1558 . In some cases , individuals are under 30 inches in height .	0	biology
 Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children , causing excessive growth .	0	biology
 In some documented cases , individuals can reach heights of over eight feet .	0	biology
 1561 . Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .	1	biology
 The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .	0	biology
 How do these hormones provide a burst of energy ?	0	biology
 1567 . FSH stimulates egg maturation in females , while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone .	0	biology
 Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova .	1	biology
 In females , the pituitary also produces prolactin , which stimulates milk production after childbirth , and oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let - down during suckling . Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use .	1	biology
 1570 . An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard , mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms .	1	biology
 An example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges .	0	biology
 1573 . The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .	0	biology
 The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity , which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck .	1	biology
 The eight cranial bones are the frontal bone , two parietal bones , two temporal bones , occipital bone , sphenoid bone , and the ethmoid bone .	0	biology
 1576 . Although it is not found in the skull , the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton .	0	biology
 The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck .	1	biology
 It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw , larynx , and tongue .	0	biology
 1579 . The thoracic cage , also known as the ribcage , is the skeleton of the chest , and consists of the ribs , sternum , thoracic vertebrae , and costal cartilages ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity , including the heart and lungs .	0	biology
 1582 . The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs ( which function to grasp and manipulate objects ) and the lower limbs ( which permit locomotion ) .	0	biology
 It also includes the pectoral girdle , or shoulder girdle , that attaches the upper limbs to the body , and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1585 . The scapulae are flat , triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle .	1	biology
 They support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint .	0	biology
 1588 . It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .	0	biology
 The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones : the ulna and the radius .	1	biology
 The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .	1	biology
 1591 . The radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other , which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb .	0	biology
 The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus ( wrist ) , the five bones of the metacarpus ( palm ) , and the 14 bones of the phalanges ( digits ) .	0	biology
 Each digit consists of three phalanges , except for the thumb , when present , which has only two .	0	biology
 1594 . The lower limb consists of the thigh , the leg , and the foot .	1	biology
 The bones of the lower limb are the femur ( thigh bone ) , patella ( kneecap ) , tibia and fibula ( bones of the leg ) , tarsals ( bones of the ankle ) , and metatarsals and phalanges ( bones of the foot ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1597 . It improves knee extension by reducing friction .	0	biology
 The tibia , or shinbone , is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee .	1	biology
 The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end , with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end .	0	biology
 1600 . The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .	0	biology
 The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot .	1	biology
 The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes .	1	biology
 1603 . There are three types of fibrous joints : sutures , syndesmoses , and gomphoses .	0	biology
 Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1606 . Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage .	1	biology
 There are two types of cartilaginous joints : synchondroses and symphyses .	0	biology
 1609 . Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones ( [ link ] ) . This space is referred to as the synovial ( or joint ) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid .	1	biology
 1612 . Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .	1	biology
 Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .	1	biology
 1615 . There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .	0	biology
 Flexion , or bending , occurs when the angle between the bones decreases .	1	biology
 Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion .	0	biology
 1618 . Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side .	0	biology
 1621 . Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis .	1	biology
 Rotation can be toward the midline of the body , which is referred to as medial rotation , or away from the midline of the body , which is referred to as lateral rotation .	0	biology
 1624 . Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward , toward the midline of the body .	1	biology

 Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane .	1	biology
 1627 . Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards .	0	biology
 Elevation is the movement of a bone upward , such as when the shoulders are shrugged , lifting the scapulae .	1	biology
 Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .	1	biology
 1630 . Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .	1	biology
 Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 1633 . Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	0	biology
 Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .	1	biology
 1636 . Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone .	1	biology
 This structure allows rotational movement , as the rounded bone moves around its own axis .	0	biology
 1639 . Ball - and - Socket JointsBall - and - socket joints possess a rounded , ball - like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone .	1	biology
 This organization allows the greatest range of motion , as all movement types are possible in all directions .	0	biology
 1642 . Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines , stomach , and urinary bladder , and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels .	0	biology
 Smooth muscle has no striations , is not under voluntary control , has only one nucleus per cell , is tapered at both ends , and is called involuntary muscle .	1	biology
 1645 . The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils — long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber .	1	biology
 Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber , and because they are only approximately 1.2 µm in diameter , hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber .	0	biology
 1648 . There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .	0	biology
 Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .	0	biology
 Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .	0	biology
 1651 . Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .	1	biology
 Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .	1	biology
 1654 . Bone , or osseous tissue , is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton .	1	biology
 It contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1657 . Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .	1	biology
 The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	1	biology
 The rounded ends , the epiphyses , are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1660 . Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required .	1	biology
 Examples of flat bones are the sternum ( breast bone ) , ribs , scapulae ( shoulder blades ) , and the roof of the skull ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1663 . Sutural bones are small , flat , irregularly shaped bones .	1	biology
 They may be found between the flat bones of the skull .	0	biology
 1666 . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .	0	biology
 Each osteon consists of lamellae , which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal .	1	biology
 The Haversian canal ( osteonic canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1669 . Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .	0	biology
 Instead , it consists of trabeculae , which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates .	1	biology
 Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae .	0	biology
 1672 . Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling , if the applied stresses have changed .	0	biology
 Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue ; these cells can not divide .	1	biology
 Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix .	0	biology
 1675 . Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes .	1	biology
 It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull , the mandible , and the clavicles .	0	biology
 1678 . Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones .	1	biology
 Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix , and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone .	1	biology
 1681 . From the nasal cavity , air passes through the pharynx ( throat ) and the larynx ( voice box ) , as it makes its way to the trachea ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body .	0	biology
 1684 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .	0	biology
 1687 . They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 As the passageways decrease in diameter , the relative amount of smooth muscle increases . The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles .	0	biology
 The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts .	0	biology
 1690 . The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust , dirt , viral particles , and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses .	0	biology
 The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage .	0	biology
 1693 . At maximal capacity , an average lung can hold almost six liters of air , but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity .	0	biology
 Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Volume measures the amount of air for one function ( such as inhalation or exhalation ) .	1	biology
 1696 . It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .	1	biology
 The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .	1	biology
 1699 . It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 The inspiratory capacity ( IC ) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration .	1	biology
 It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1702 . Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .	0	biology
 An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .	1	biology
 1705 . Gas Exchange across the AlveoliIn the body , oxygen is used by cells of the body ’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product .	0	biology
 The ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient ( RQ ) .	1	biology
 RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0 .	0	biology
 1708 . No muscles are contracting to expel the air . Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac .	0	biology
 The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura .	1	biology
 A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1711 . The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate .	1	biology
 On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .	0	biology
 1714 . This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid - air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together .	0	biology
 Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli .	1	biology
 By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid , it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse .	0	biology
 1717 . Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis .	0	biology
 In both diseases , the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic .	0	biology
 1720 . It is also independent of cardiac output .	0	biology
 This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment , which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases .	1	biology
 As cardiac output increases , the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused ( filled with blood ) increases .	1	biology
 1723 . Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place .	1	biology
 Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt , arises from an anatomical failure , while physiological dead space or physiological shunt , arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries .	1	biology
 1726 . The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood ( x - axis ) versus the relative Hb - oxygen saturation ( y - axis ) .	1	biology
 The resulting graph — an oxygen dissociation curve — is sigmoidal , or S - shaped ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 As the partial pressure of oxygen increases , the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen .	0	biology
 1729 . This is painful when it occurs .	0	biology
 Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb .	1	biology
 Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells , but these cells have lower - than - normal levels of hemoglobin .	0	biology
 1732 . In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	0	biology
 Carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) .	0	biology
 Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions	1	biology
 1735 . As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .	1	biology
 As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .	0	biology
 1738 . The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	1	biology
 This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .	0	biology
 1741 . As shown in [ link]b , amphibians have a three - chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two - chambered heart of fish .	0	biology
 The two atria ( superior heart chambers ) receive blood from the two different circuits ( the lungs and the systems ) , and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart ’s ventricle ( inferior heart chamber ) , which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation .	1	biology
 The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body .	0	biology
 1744 . Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones , and by removing waste .	0	biology
 Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease - fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection .	0	biology
 1747 . The atria are the chambers that receive blood , and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood .	1	biology
 The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava , which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms , as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs .	1	biology
 In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .	1	biology
 1750 . The left atrium then receives the oxygen - rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins .	0	biology
 This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve ( the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart ) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta , the major artery of the body , taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body .	1	biology
 Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta , the aortic semilunar valve ( or aortic valve ) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle .	0	biology
 1753 . The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1756 . The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques .	1	biology
 Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .	0	biology
 1759 . The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 In each cardiac cycle , the heart contracts ( systole ) , pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body ; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( diastole ) , where the heart fills with blood , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The atria contract at the same time , forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles .	0	biology
 1762 . The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes .	0	biology
 This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram ( ECG)—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle .	1	biology
 1765 . Arterioles diverge into capillary beds .	0	biology
 Capillary beds contain a large number ( 10 to 100 ) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body .	0	biology
 Capillaries are narrow - diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients , waste , and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level .	1	biology
 1768 . In capillaries , this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells , as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis .	0	biology
 The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction , narrowing of the blood vessels , and vasodilation , widening of the blood vessels ; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure .	1	biology
 1771 . Throughout the cardiac cycle , the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate .	1	biology
 This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance .	0	biology
 1774 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 1777 . The body ’s fluids include blood plasma , the cytosol within cells , and interstitial fluid , the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body .	1	biology
 The membranes of the body ( such as the pleural , serous , and cell membranes ) are semi - permeable membranes .	0	biology
 Semi - permeable membranes are permeable ( or permissive ) to certain types of solutes and water .	1	biology
 1780 . The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 If the solvent is water , one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water .	0	biology
 1783 . The kidneys , illustrated in [ link ] , are a pair of bean - shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity .	1	biology
 The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands .	0	biology
 1786 . The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	1	biology
 1789 . The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .	1	biology
 The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 1792 . There are , on average , eight renal pyramids in each kidney .	0	biology
 The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .	1	biology
 The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 1795 . On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	1	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1798 . The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 1801 . Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex , giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally .	0	biology
 There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .	0	biology
 A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries .	0	biology
 1804 . The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function .	1	biology
 The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	0	biology
 1807 . The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered .	0	biology
 The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole .	1	biology
 The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole .	1	biology
 1810 . In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	1	biology
 In juxtamedullary nephrons , the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta .	0	biology
 1813 . Water is also reabsorbed during this step .	0	biology
 Then , additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion , which is , in essence , the opposite process to tubular reabsorption .	0	biology
 The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae .	0	biology
 608 . In shotgun sequencing method , several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces ( somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun ) .	1	biology
 All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain - sequencing method .	0	biology
 614 . DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences .	1	biology
 Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays , whereas whole - genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome .	0	biology
 617 . Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics .	0	biology
 Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .	1	biology
 The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .	1	biology
 620 . Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer ; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process .	1	biology
 An individual protein is called a biomarker , whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature .	0	biology
 For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as sweat , blood , or urine , such that large - scale screenings can be performed in a non - invasive fashion .	0	biology
 626 . Darwin called this mechanism natural selection .	0	biology
 Natural selection , also known as “ survival of the fittest , ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change .	1	biology
 629 . Sometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other .	0	biology
 When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point , it is called divergent evolution .	1	biology
 Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ( [ link]).Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor .	0	biology
 632 . Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all , and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor .	1	biology
 These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures .	0	biology
 Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds , leaves on some cacti , and hind leg bones in whales .	0	biology
 638 . For example , even though bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) and African fish eagles ( Haliaeetus vocifer ) are both birds and eagles , each belongs to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch , that offspring , called a hybrid ( a cross between two species ) , would probably be infertile — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity .	1	biology
 Different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions .	0	biology
" 641 . Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution ."	1	biology
" Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location ."	1	biology
 644 . Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed .	1	biology
 In some cases , a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The prefix “ auto- ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species .	1	biology
 647 . Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually .	1	biology
 Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .	1	biology
 A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .	0	biology
 650 . In some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species .	1	biology
 This situation is called habitat isolation .	0	biology
 Reproduction with the parent species ceases , and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent .	0	biology
 653 . Hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages .	1	biology
 This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable .	0	biology
 In another postzygotic situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called hybrid sterility .	1	biology
 662 . Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences , or genetic variance , among individuals in a population .	1	biology
 The greater the hereditability of a population ’s phenotypic variation , the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation .	0	biology
 665 . While it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool .	0	biology
 However , if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other , this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring , a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression .	1	biology
 668 . Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events , such as a natural disaster that kills — at random — a large portion of the population .	0	biology
 Known as the bottleneck effect , it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In one fell swoop , the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - disaster population .	0	biology
 671 . Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection .	0	biology
 One common form of mate choice , called assortative mating , is an individual ’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves .	1	biology
 674 . Natural selection only acts on the population ’s heritable traits : selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution .	1	biology
 Natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms .	0	biology
 677 . If natural selection favors an average phenotype , selecting against extreme variation , the population will undergo stabilizing selection ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In a population of mice that live in the woods , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators .	0	biology
 680 . Another type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , favors phenotypes that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) .	1	biology
 An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest .	0	biology
 683 . The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease .	1	biology
 Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority , which they will then pass on to their offspring .	0	biology
 686 . Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms .	0	biology
 A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms .	1	biology
 Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships .	0	biology
 689 . The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .	1	biology
 A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 692 . Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these disciplines together contribute to building , updating , and maintaining the “ tree of life . ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics .	0	biology
 Data may be collected from fossils , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by DNA analysis .	0	biology
 695 . Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .	1	biology
 After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 698 . This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions .	0	biology
 When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an analogy or homoplasy .	1	biology
 For example , insects use wings to fly like bats and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different .	0	biology
 704 . To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately , scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony , which means that events occurred in the simplest , most obvious way .	1	biology
 For example , if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking , based on the principle of maximum parsimony , one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones .	0	biology
 710 . The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .	1	biology
 All of these hypotheses are testable .	0	biology
 713 . Virions , single virus particles , are very small , about 20–250 nanometers in diameter .	0	biology
 These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell .	1	biology
 716 . Viruses come in many shapes and sizes , but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family .	0	biology
 All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .	1	biology
 The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .	0	biology
 719 . Glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells .	1	biology
 Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions .	1	biology
 Chicken pox , influenza , and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes .	0	biology
 722 . Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .	0	biology
 Group II viruses have single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as their genome .	1	biology
 They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .	0	biology
 725 . Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .	1	biology
 Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .	1	biology
 Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .	1	biology
 728 . Additionally , full - length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative - stranded genome .	0	biology
 Group VI viruses have diploid ( two copies ) ssRNA genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse transcriptase , to dsDNA ; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .	1	biology
 731 . The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage .	1	biology
 These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .	0	biology
 Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .	1	biology
 737 . When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	1	biology
 If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4 , which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract .	0	biology
 740 . An example is the animal herpesviruses , including herpes simplex viruses , the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans .	0	biology
 In a process called latency , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions , only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates .	1	biology
 Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency , the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages .	0	biology
 743 . Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .	0	biology
 Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .	0	biology
 Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .	1	biology
 746 . Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s sap , by living organisms such as insects and nematodes , and through pollen .	1	biology
 When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 752 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .	0	biology
 Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .	1	biology
 Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host .	0	biology
 755 . The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them .	0	biology
 Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic - resistant bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries .	0	biology
 However , the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria .	0	biology
 As more and more antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria evolve , the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide .	0	biology
 758 . It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle .	0	biology
 PrP exists in two forms , PrPc , the normal form of the protein , and PrPsc , the infectious form .	0	biology
 Once introduced into the body , the PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc .	0	biology
 761 . Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth ; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago .	0	biology
 A microbial mat is a multi - layered sheet of prokaryotes ( [ link ] ) that includes mostly bacteria , but also archaea .	1	biology
 Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick , and they typically grow where different types of materials interface , mostly on moist surfaces .	0	biology
 767 . Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .	0	biology
 Cyanobacteria ( [ link ] ) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere .	1	biology
 770 . In other cases , culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions , even though the same organism could be cultured previously .	0	biology
 Those organisms that can not be cultured but are not dead are in a viable - but - non - culturable ( VBNC ) state .	1	biology
 The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival .	0	biology
 773 . The cell wall functions as a protective layer , and it is responsible for the organism ’s shape .	1	biology
 Some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall .	0	biology
 Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species , but not in others ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 776 . There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan .	0	biology
 S - layer ( surface layer ) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria .	1	biology
 779 . There are four different types of Archaean cell walls .	0	biology
 One type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan , which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain .	1	biology
 The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides , glycoproteins , or pure protein .	0	biology
 788 . Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .	1	biology
 Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .	1	biology
 Ammonia released to the atmosphere , however , represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released ; the rest is as N2 and N2O .	0	biology
 791 . Epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population .	1	biology
 An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .	1	biology
 A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 794 . One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death ( 1346 to 1361 ) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .	0	biology
 It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread along the Silk Road , a network of land and sea trade routes , to the Mediterranean region and Europe , carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships .	0	biology
 797 . The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning “ against ” and bios meaning “ life . ” An antibiotic is a chemical , produced either by microbes or synthetically , that is hostile to the growth of other organisms .	1	biology
 Today ’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis .	0	biology
 800 . Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common .	0	biology
 A foodborne disease ( colloquially called “ food poisoning ” ) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria , viruses , or other parasites that contaminate food .	1	biology
 Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .	0	biology
 803 . Biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes : soil bacteria , cyanobacteria , and Frankia spp .	1	biology
 ( filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder , bayberry , and sweet fern ) .	0	biology
 806 . Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes ( or microbial metabolism ) to remove pollutants .	1	biology
 Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals ( pesticides , fertilizers ) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface .	0	biology
 809 . Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic .	0	biology
 Their cells contain , in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles , another kind of organelle called a plastid .	0	biology
 When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis , their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments , called accessory pigments , which are involved in harvesting energy from light .	1	biology
 812 . Subtypes of heterotrophs , called saprobes , absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes .	1	biology
 Some protists can function as mixotrophs , obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes , depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available .	1	biology
 815 . The human parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa , the kinetoplastids .	0	biology
 The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast , a DNA mass carried within the single , oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells .	1	biology
 This subgroup includes several parasites , collectively called trypanosomes , which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle .	1	biology
 818 . Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane , called the anal pore .	1	biology
 In addition to a vacuole - based digestive system , Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles , which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell .	1	biology
 821 . The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod , thereby moving the entire cell .	0	biology
 This type of motion , called cytoplasmic streaming , is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen .	1	biology
 824 . For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi .	0	biology
 The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae .	1	biology
 Through mycorrhizae , the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively , lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner ( usually an alga ) .	1	biology
 827 . Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions .	1	biology
 Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts .	1	biology
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) and Candida species ( the agents of thrush , a common fungal infection ) are examples of unicellular fungi ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 830 . Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa ( singular , septum ) ( [ link]a , c ) .	1	biology
 In most phyla of fungi , tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha .	0	biology
 833 . Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive .	1	biology
 Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .	1	biology
 Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .	0	biology
 836 . The rings swell when they touch the nematode , gripping it in a tight hold .	0	biology
 The fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria .	0	biology
 Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria , as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host , release digestive enzymes within the host 's body , and absorb the digested nutrients .	1	biology
 839 . When both mating types are present in the same mycelium , it is called homothallic , or self - fertile .	1	biology
 Heterothallic mycelia require two different , but compatible , mycelia to reproduce sexually .	1	biology
 842 . The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes .	0	biology
 The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota , or true fungi .	1	biology
 845 . The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota , which is characterized by the formation of an ascus ( plural , asci ) , a sac - like structure that contains haploid ascospores .	1	biology
 Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance .	0	biology
 848 . This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage .	0	biology
 Eventually , the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp , which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground — this is what we think of as a mushroom .	1	biology
 The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap . Art Connection	0	biology
 851 . The Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about 230 species that all live in close association with the roots of trees .	1	biology
 Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .	0	biology
 854 . Both parasites and pathogens harm the host ; however , the pathogen causes a disease , whereas the parasite usually does not .	0	biology
 Commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other .	1	biology
 857 . Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans ( and other animals ) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins ( mycotoxins ) .	1	biology
 Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms .	1	biology
 In addition , individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions .	0	biology
 860 . The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .	0	biology
 In a second type , the Glomeromycete fungi form vesicular – arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( sometimes called endomycorrhizae ) .	0	biology
 In these mycorrhiza , the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 863 . Most biologists also consider green algae to be plants , although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom .	0	biology
 The reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae , the Charophytes , share common characteristics with land plants ( such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants ) .	0	biology
 These characteristics are absent in other types of algae .	0	biology
 866 . Two different types of spores are produced in land plants , resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle .	0	biology
 Seedless non - vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous .	1	biology
 The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants .	0	biology
 869 . The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .	0	biology
 872 . In the gametangia , precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis .	0	biology
 The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .	0	biology
 Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .	1	biology
 875 . In a further division , land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue , as detailed in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Plants that lack vascular tissue , which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients , are referred to as non - vascular plants .	1	biology
 Liverworts , mosses , and hornworts are seedless , non - vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution .	0	biology
 878 . Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually , by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae .	0	biology
 In this latter type of reproduction , the gemmae — small , intact , complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus ( shown in [ link])—are splashed out of the cup by raindrops .	0	biology
 The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes .	0	biology
 881 . For example , stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte , and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte ’s stalk .	0	biology
 Additionally , mosses are anchored to the substrate — whether it is soil , rock , or roof tiles — by multicellular rhizoids .	0	biology
 These structures are precursors of roots .	0	biology
 884 . A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal .	1	biology
 The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular , close - fitting units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on moisture levels , and periodically release spores .	0	biology
 887 . The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .	1	biology
 Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls , and are thus described as lignified .	1	biology
 Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue .	1	biology
 893 . Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia .	1	biology
 Strobili are cone - like structures that contain sporangia .	1	biology
 They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones .	0	biology
 896 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Whisk Ferns)While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots , the whisk ferns , Class Psilotopsida , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction .	0	biology
 Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia .	0	biology
 902 . Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation .	0	biology
 The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium , and later , the embryo , is called the integument .	1	biology
 905 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .	0	biology
 One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .	0	biology
 5300 . Flash mobs are examples of collective behavior , noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage .	1	sociology
 Other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of teens adopting a favorite singer ’s hairstyle .	0	sociology
 5303 . Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .	1	sociology
 Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .	1	sociology
 5306 . The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .	1	sociology
 A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .	1	sociology
 A public , on the other hand , is an unorganized , relatively diffused group of people who share ideas , such as the Libertarian political party .	1	sociology
 5309 . Neil Smelser ’s ( 1962 ) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior , called value - added theory , is a perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur .	1	sociology
 Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur .	0	sociology
 5312 . Social organizations worldwide take stands on such general areas of concern as poverty , sex trafficking , and the use of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) in food .	0	sociology
 Nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) are sometimes formed to support such movements , such as the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement ( FOAM ) .	0	sociology
 Global efforts to reduce poverty are represented by the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief ( OXFAM ) , among others .	0	sociology
 5315 . is a revolutionary movement .	0	sociology
 Religious / Redemptive movements are “ meaning seeking , ” and their goal is to provoke inner change or spiritual growth in individuals .	1	sociology
 Organizations pushing these movements include Heaven ’s Gate or the Branch Davidians .	0	sociology
 5318 . Resource MobilizationMcCarthy and Zald ( 1977 ) conceptualize resource mobilization theory as a way to explain movement success in terms of the ability to acquire resources and mobilize individuals .	1	sociology
 Resources are primarily time and money , and the more of both , the greater the power of organized movements .	0	sociology
 5321 . Successful social movements use three kinds of frames ( Snow and Benford 1988 ) to further their goals .	0	sociology
 The first type , diagnostic framing , states the problem in a clear , easily understood way .	1	sociology
 When applying diagnostic frames , there are no shades of gray : instead , there is the belief that what “ they ” do is wrong and this is how “ we ” will fix it .	0	sociology
 5324 . In the gay marriage movement , a call to action might encourage you to vote “ no ” on Proposition 8 in California ( a move to limit marriage to male - female couples ) , or conversely , to contact your local congressperson to express your viewpoint that marriage should be restricted to male - female couples . With so many similar diagnostic frames , some groups find it best to join together to maximize their impact .	0	sociology
 When social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and merge into a single group , a frame alignment process ( Snow et al .	0	sociology
 1986 ) occurs — an ongoing and intentional means of recruiting participants to the movement .	1	sociology
 5327 . How has this technology affected social change in our society and others ?	0	sociology
 One very positive way is crowdsourcing . Thanks to the web , digital crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed services , ideas , or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people , and especially from an online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers .	1	sociology
 Web - based companies such as Kickstarter have been created precisely for the purposes of raising large amounts of money in a short period of time , notably by sidestepping the traditional financing process .	0	sociology
 5330 . Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .	1	sociology
 A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .	0	sociology
 5336 . It is impossible to study one without the other .	0	sociology
 German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior figuration .	1	sociology
 An application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion .	0	sociology
 5339 . This even applied to the researchers themselves , who , they believed , should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research .	0	sociology
 To deal with this problem , Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of verstehen , a German word that means to understand in a deep way .	1	sociology
" In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to "" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """	0	sociology
 5342 . Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .	0	sociology
 Qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in - depth interviews , focus groups , and analysis of content sources ( like books , magazines , journals , and popular media ) .	1	sociology
 5345 . Macro - level theories relate to large - scale issues and large groups of people , while micro - level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups .	1	sociology
 Grand theories attempt to explain large - scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change .	1	sociology
 Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete .	0	sociology
 5348 . Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .	0	sociology
 The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the social institutions , or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs , such as government , education , family , healthcare , religion , and the economy .	1	sociology
 5351 . Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society , but in order to study society , sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts .	0	sociology
 Social facts are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	1	sociology
 Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society .	0	sociology
 5354 . Conflict TheoryConflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources .	1	sociology
 This perspective is a macro - level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx ( 1818–1883 ) , who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social , material , and political resources such as food and housing , employment , education , and leisure time .	0	sociology
 5357 . Constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be .	1	sociology
 We develop social constructs based on interactions with others , and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed - upon or generally accepted by most within the society .	0	sociology
 5360 . People commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an occurrence .	0	sociology
 Social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason .	0	sociology
 A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .	1	sociology
 5363 . Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .	0	sociology
 Researchers also strive for validity , which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure .	1	sociology
 Returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic , reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon .	0	sociology
 5366 . A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related ; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables .	1	sociology
 In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .	0	sociology
 5369 . While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach , others operate from an interpretive framework .	0	sociology
 While systematic , this approach does n’t follow the hypothesis - testing model that seeks to find generalizable results .	0	sociology
 5372 . As a research method , a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions , often in the form of a questionnaire .	1	sociology
 The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods .	0	sociology
 5375 . The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .	0	sociology
 In a random sample , every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study .	1	sociology
 According to the laws of probability , random samples represent the population as a whole .	0	sociology
 5378 . The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses , some of which may be surprising .	0	sociology
 The benefit of written opinions , though , is the wealth of material that they provide . An interview is a one - on - one conversation between the researcher and the subject , and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic .	1	sociology
 Interviews are similar to the short - answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions .	0	sociology
 5381 . Later , he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology .	0	sociology
 However , Rothman ’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “ dot com ” company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material . Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation , in which researchers join people and participate in a group ’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context .	1	sociology
 This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life .	0	sociology
 5384 . One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment , meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis — a scientific approach .	1	sociology
 5387 . A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records .	0	sociology
 To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources , sociologists employ content analysis , applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand .	1	sociology
 5390 . Or if you are having coffee with a good friend , perhaps that question warrants a more detailed response .	0	sociology
 These examples are all aspects of culture , which is shared beliefs , values , and practices , that participants must learn .	1	sociology
 Sociologically , we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is expected , and in which situations perhaps it is not .	0	sociology
 5393 . ethnocentrism , or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one ’s own cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Ethnocentrism , as sociologist William Graham Sumner ( 1906 ) described the term , involves a belief or attitude that one ’s own culture is better than all others .	0	sociology
 5396 . Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .	0	sociology
 Beliefs are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true .	1	sociology
 Individuals in a society have specific beliefs , but they also share collective values .	0	sociology
 5399 . A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “ thank you . ” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus .	0	sociology
 People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .	0	sociology
 Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .	1	sociology
 5402 . Formal norms are established , written rules .	1	sociology
 They are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people .	0	sociology
 5405 . Writing another person ’s words as if they are one ’s own has a name — plagiarism .	1	sociology
 The consequences for violating this norm are severe and usually result in expulsion . Unlike mores , folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings .	1	sociology
 Rather , folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day - to - day practices and expressions of a culture .	0	sociology
 5408 . In the United States , for example , the number thirteen is associated with bad luck .	0	sociology
 In Japan , however , the number four is considered unlucky , since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “ death . ” The Sapir - Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language , and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language .	0	sociology
 The hypothesis , which has also been called linguistic relativity , states that language shapes thought ( Swoyer 2003 ) .	1	sociology
 5411 . Subculture and CountercultureA subculture is just what it sounds like — a smaller cultural group within a larger culture ; people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group .	1	sociology
 5420 . Hunter - gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various types of preindustrial societies .	0	sociology
 As the basic structure of human society until about 10,000–12,000 years ago , these groups were based around kinship or tribes .	0	sociology
 5429 . His primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing , and people were becoming more divided .	0	sociology
 In his book The Division of Labor in Society ( 1893 ) , Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the transition from mechanical to organic . Preindustrial societies , Durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical solidarity , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture .	0	sociology
 Societies with mechanical solidarity act in a mechanical fashion ; things are done mostly because they have always been done that way .	0	sociology
 5432 . Additionally , Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change .	0	sociology
 Economically , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the bourgeoisie — and the laborers , called the proletariat .	1	sociology
 Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution .	0	sociology
 5435 . Another idea that Marx developed is the concept of false consciousness .	0	sociology
 False consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs , ideals , or ideology of a person are not in the person ’s own best interest .	1	sociology
 5438 . The symbolic interactionism theory , the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology , is based on Weber ’s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society .	0	sociology
 For Weber , the culmination of industrialization , rationalization , and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage , in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy .	1	sociology
 This leads to a sense of “ disenchantment of the world , ” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity .	1	sociology
 5441 . Another way of looking at this concept is through W.I .	0	sociology
 Thomas ’s notable Thomas theorem which states , “ If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( Thomas and Thomas 1928 ) .	0	sociology
 That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .	0	sociology
 5444 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .	1	sociology
 Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 5450 . All we can observe is behavior , or role performance .	0	sociology
 Role performance is how a person expresses his or her role .	1	sociology
 Sociologist Erving Goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage .	0	sociology
 5456 . And commuting times and distances have continued to increase as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers .	0	sociology
 Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .	1	sociology
 Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	1	sociology
 5459 . As the Social Policy & Debate feature illustrates , the suburbs also have their share of socio - economic problems .	0	sociology
 In the United States , white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from racially mixed urban areas and toward the suburbs .	1	sociology
 This occurred throughout the twentieth century , due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by Brown v. Board of Education to the Mariel boatlift of Cubans fleeing Cuba ’s Mariel port for Miami .	0	sociology
 5465 . While you might be more familiar with the phrase “ global warming , ” climate change is the term now used to refer to long - term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and , in particular , the release of greenhouse gases into the environment .	1	sociology
 The planet as a whole is warming , but the term climate change acknowledges that the short - term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures , despite the overarching trend toward warmth .	0	sociology
 5468 . Often , the stories are not newsmakers , but simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as Centralia , Pennsylvania and Hinkley , California .	0	sociology
 In many cases , people in these neighborhoods can be part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause .	0	sociology
 5471 . Where will people live ?	0	sociology
 To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .	1	sociology
 Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .	1	sociology
 5474 . Changing fertility , mortality , and migration rates make up the total population composition , a snapshot of the demographic profile of a population .	1	sociology
 This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .	0	sociology
 5477 . Ehrlich 's ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse , as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources such as water and air .	0	sociology
 He advocated for a goal of zero population growth ( ZPG ) , in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration .	1	sociology
 While support for this concept is mixed , it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation .	0	sociology
 5480 . Later , George Herbert Mead ( 1863–1931 ) studied the self , a person ’s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction .	1	sociology
 In order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others .	0	sociology
 5483 . Most importantly , we have to learn language — whether it ’s the dominant language or one common in a subculture , whether it ’s verbal or through signs — in order to communicate and to think .	0	sociology
 As we saw with Danielle , without socialization we literally have no self . Nature versus NurtureSome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture — the relationships and caring that surround us .	1	sociology
 Others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics .	0	sociology
 5486 . Just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers , play house , and dress up , adults also engage in anticipatory socialization , the preparation for future life roles .	1	sociology
 Examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon - to - be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new arrival .	0	sociology
 5489 . Peer GroupsA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests .	1	sociology
 Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years , such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns , the rules of a game , or how to shoot a basket .	0	sociology
 5492 . The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby .	1	sociology
 In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group .	0	sociology
 5495 . Types of GroupsSociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864–1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) .	0	sociology
 According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives .	0	sociology
 5498 . The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way .	0	sociology
 Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840–1910 ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .	0	sociology
 In short , an in - group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .	1	sociology
 5501 . After all , how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders ?	0	sociology
 Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .	1	sociology
 An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .	1	sociology
 5504 . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high - profile woman who is an instrumental leader .	0	sociology
 Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .	0	sociology
 Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .	1	sociology
 5507 . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress .	0	sociology
 As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks .	1	sociology
 These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals .	0	sociology
 5510 . From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .	0	sociology
 Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .	0	sociology
 A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization .	1	sociology
 5513 . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .	0	sociology
 Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) .	0	sociology
 A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .	1	sociology
 5516 . A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform .	1	sociology
 For example , psychology professors teach psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms .	0	sociology
 5519 . This results in an impersonal organization .	0	sociology
 Customers frequently complain that stores like Walmart care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice .	1	sociology
 In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript .	0	sociology
 5522 . And what is the relationship between deviance and crime ?	0	sociology
 According to sociologist William Graham Sumner , deviance is a violation of established contextual , cultural , or social norms , whether folkways , mores , or codified law ( 1906 ) .	1	sociology
 It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder .	0	sociology
 5525 . Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .	0	sociology
 When a worker violates a workplace guideline , the manager steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules , the manager may praise or promote the employee . The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions .	1	sociology
 Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .	0	sociology
 5528 . Although shoplifting , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose .	0	sociology
 That does n’t mean picking your nose in public wo n’t be punished ; instead , you will encounter informal sanctions .	0	sociology
 Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .	0	sociology
 5531 . Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s , social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control .	1	sociology
 An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use , violence , teenage delinquency , and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community .	0	sociology
 5534 . Conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher , economist , and social scientist Karl Marx .	0	sociology
 Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups .	0	sociology
 5537 . Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation .	0	sociology
 Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others .	1	sociology
 Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept .	0	sociology
 5540 . Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) .	0	sociology
 His conclusions established differential association theory , which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance .	1	sociology
 According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes .	0	sociology
 5543 . In modern U.S. society , crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity .	0	sociology
 Violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force .	1	sociology
 Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .	0	sociology
 5546 . When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .	1	sociology
 An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .	1	sociology
 Embezzlement , insider trading , and identity theft are all types of corporate crime .	0	sociology
 5549 . Due to these issues , the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes a separate self - report study known as the National Crime Victimization Report ( NCVR ) .	0	sociology
 A self - report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods , such as questionnaires or telephone interviews .	1	sociology
 Self - report data are gathered each year , asking approximately 160,000 people in the United States about the frequency and types of crime they ’ve experienced in their daily lives ( BJS 2013 ) .	0	sociology
 5552 . CourtsOnce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police , the case goes to court .	0	sociology
 A court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law .	1	sociology
 The U.S. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts .	0	sociology
 5555 . The first is differential class - based access to technology in the form of the digital divide .	0	sociology
 This digital divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology .	1	sociology
 Simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools .	0	sociology
 5558 . According to the functionalist perspective , health is vital to the stability of the society , and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance .	0	sociology
 Talcott Parsons ( 1951 ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them .	0	sociology
 5561 . As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness .	1	sociology
 The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .	1	sociology
 A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .	1	sociology
 5564 . Unfortunately , the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2013 shows that 18 percent of people in the United States have no health insurance at all .	0	sociology
 Equally alarming , a study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that in 2010 , 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured ; that is , people who pay at least 10 percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least 5 percent of their income ( Schoen , Doty , Robertson , and Collins 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 The Commonwealth study further reports that while underinsurance has historically been an issue that low - income families faced , today it is affecting middle - income families more and more . Why are so many people uninsured or underinsured ?	0	sociology
 5567 . The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free healthcare to all its residents .	0	sociology
 And despite some U.S. citizens’ knee - jerk reaction to any healthcare changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration . It is important to distinguish between socialized medicine , in which the government owns the healthcare system , and universal healthcare , which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone .	1	sociology
 Germany , Singapore , and Canada all have universal healthcare .	0	sociology
 5570 . Marilyn Winkleby and her research associates ( 1992 ) state that “ one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of a person 's morbidity and mortality experience is that person 's socioeconomic status ( SES ) .	0	sociology
 This finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions , continues throughout the entire lifespan , and extends across numerous risk factors for disease . ” Morbidity is the incidence of disease . It is important to remember that economics are only part of the SES picture ; research suggests that education also plays an important role .	1	sociology
 Phelan and Link ( 2003 ) note that many behavior - influenced diseases like lung cancer ( from smoking ) , coronary artery disease ( from poor eating and exercise habits ) , and AIDS initially were widespread across SES groups .	0	sociology
 5573 . Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time .	1	sociology
 Anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorders , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and both social and specific phobias . The second most common mental disorders in the United States are mood disorders ; roughly 10 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected yearly , while 21 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .	0	sociology
 Major mood disorders are depression , bipolar disorder , and dysthymic disorder .	0	sociology
 5576 . The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 They use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations , while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation .	1	sociology
 Before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) in 1990 , people in the United States with disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted .	0	sociology
 5579 . Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases .	1	sociology
 Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations .	0	sociology
 5582 . The stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it worse than it needs to be .	0	sociology
 Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals .	1	sociology
 Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients’ heads , depending on the opinion of the medical professional .	0	sociology
 5585 . These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .	0	sociology
 The second type of patent is a design patent .	0	sociology
 Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .	1	sociology
 5588 . New media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange .	1	sociology
 These include social networking sites , blogs , podcasts , wikis , and virtual worlds .	0	sociology
 5591 . But the numbers are misleading .	0	sociology
 Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .	1	sociology
 This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .	1	sociology
 5594 . Such a fast - paced dynamic is not always to our benefit .	0	sociology
 Some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction , a result in which people are too overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue , so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action ( Lazerfeld and Merton 1948 ) .	1	sociology
 5597 . Increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism , the application to , and promotion of , feminism online .	1	sociology
 Research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by women living in Iraq during the second Gulf War ( Peirce 2011 ) to an investigation of the Suicide Girls web site ( Magnet 2007 ) .	0	sociology
 305 . Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light , which is the absorption spectrum .	1	biology
 The graph in [ link ] shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and a type of carotenoid pigment called β - carotene ( which absorbs blue and green light ) .	1	biology
 308 . Both photosystems have the same basic structure ; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place .	0	biology
 Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids .	1	biology
 311 . The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property .	0	biology
 Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation ; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact .	0	biology
 It is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .	0	biology
 314 . Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI , they must be re - energized by PSI , hence , another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna .	0	biology
 That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center ( called P700 ) .	1	biology
 P700 is oxidized and sends a high - energy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH .	0	biology
 317 . That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA .	0	biology
 Recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule .	1	biology
 Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used .	0	biology
" 320 . An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands ."	0	biology
 A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , delivering a signal in the process .	1	biology
 Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 323 . The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse .	1	biology
 A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells .	1	biology
 Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .	0	biology
 326 . Signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals , and they originate from endocrine cells .	1	biology
 ( In the body , many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands , such as the thyroid gland , the hypothalamus , and the pituitary gland . )	0	biology
 329 . Internal receptors , also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors , are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane .	1	biology
 Once inside the cell , many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis ( transcription ) to mediate gene expression .	0	biology
 332 . Ion channel - linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through .	1	biology
 To form a channel , this type of cell - surface receptor has an extensive membrane - spanning region .	0	biology
 335 . Once a ligand binds to a receptor , the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 Continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction .	0	biology
 Signal transduction only occurs with cell - surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis .	0	biology
 338 . After the ligand binds to the cell - surface receptor , the activation of the receptor ’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade .	0	biology
 In a signaling pathway , second messengers , enzymes , and activated proteins interact with specific proteins , which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell ’s environment ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 341 . Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor .	1	biology
 These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins .	0	biology
 344 . Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane , inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers .	1	biology
 Because these molecules are membrane components , they are located near membrane - bound receptors and can easily interact with them .	0	biology
 347 . Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells .	0	biology
 The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors .	1	biology
 Most growth factors bind to cell - surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases .	0	biology
 350 . For example , phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation .	1	biology
 Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase , and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca2 + pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell .	0	biology
 353 . Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind .	1	biology
 The secreted autoinducers can be small , hydrophobic molecules such as acyl - homoserine lactone , ( AHL ) or larger peptide - based molecules ; each type of molecule has a different mode of action .	0	biology
 356 . Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells .	0	biology
 Human body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .	0	biology
 A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .	1	biology
 359 . Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes . Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .	1	biology
 362 . The DNA - histone complex is called chromatin .	1	biology
 The beadlike , histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome , and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA .	1	biology
 A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones , and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter , in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix .	0	biology
 365 . The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells .	1	biology
 Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth , DNA replication , and division that produces two identical ( clone ) cells .	0	biology
 368 . The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase ( first gap ) because , from a microscopic aspect , little change is visible .	1	biology
 However , during the G1 stage , the cell is quite active at the biochemical level .	0	biology
 371 . The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle , the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis .	1	biology
 At the center of each animal cell , the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod - like objects , the centrioles , which are at right angles to each other .	1	biology
 Centrioles help organize cell division .	0	biology
 374 . Karyokinesis , also known as mitosis , is divided into a series of phases — prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase — that result in the division of the cell nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Karyokinesis is also called mitosis .	0	biology
 377 . During prometaphase , the “ first change phase , ” many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance .	1	biology
 The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment .	0	biology
 380 . During anaphase , the “ upward phase , ” the cohesin proteins degrade , and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere .	1	biology
 Each chromatid , now called a chromosome , is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached .	0	biology
 383 . The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward , forming a fissure .	1	biology
 This fissure , or “ crack , ” is called the cleavage furrow .	0	biology
 The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts , and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two ( [ link]).In plant cells , a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells .	0	biology
 386 . Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide .	0	biology
 The cell is in a quiescent ( inactive ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle .	1	biology
 Some cells enter G0 temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of G1 .	0	biology
 389 . Tumor Suppressor GenesLike proto - oncogenes , many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous .	0	biology
 Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins , the type of regulators that , when activated , can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division .	1	biology
 The collective function of the best - understood tumor suppressor gene proteins , Rb , p53 , and p21 , is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed .	0	biology
 392 . The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , p53 , and p21 .	0	biology
 Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor - suppressor proteins common in many cells .	1	biology
 395 . After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell , cytoplasmic separation begins .	0	biology
 The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids .	0	biology
 Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .	0	biology
 398 . Most animals and plants are diploid , containing two sets of chromosomes .	1	biology
 In each somatic cell of the organism ( all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells ) , the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome , called homologous chromosomes .	1	biology
 Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as “ body ” cells .	0	biology
 401 . Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis , the same stage names are assigned .	0	biology
 However , because there are two rounds of division , the major process and the stages are designated with a “ I ” or a “ II . ” Thus , meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I , prometaphase I , and so on .	1	biology
 Meiosis II , in which the second round of meiotic division takes place , includes prophase II , prometaphase II , and so on .	1	biology
 404 . In mitosis , homologous chromosomes line up end - to - end so that when they divide , each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair .	0	biology
 The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .	1	biology
 The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .	1	biology
 407 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .	0	biology
 These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .	1	biology
 410 . In some species , cells enter a brief interphase , or interkinesis , before entering meiosis II .	0	biology
 Interkinesis lacks an S phase , so chromosomes are not duplicated .	0	biology
 413 . Fertilization , the joining of two haploid gametes , restores the diploid condition .	1	biology
 There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms : diploid - dominant , in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with most animals including humans ; haploid - dominant , in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with all fungi and some algae ; and alternation of generations , in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group , as with plants and some algae .	1	biology
 416 . Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote .	1	biology
 The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte .	1	biology
 Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores .	0	biology
 419 . Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .	0	biology
 The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring , but we now know that this is not the case .	1	biology
 Mendel was the first researcher to see it .	0	biology
 422 . Plants used in first - generation crosses were called P0 , or parental generation one , plants ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .	0	biology
 425 . In his 1865 publication , Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics , each with two contrasting traits .	0	biology
 A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic .	1	biology
 The characteristics included plant height , seed texture , seed color , flower color , pea pod size , pea pod color , and flower position .	0	biology
 428 . Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .	1	biology
 Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .	1	biology
 The recessive trait does , however , reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring .	0	biology
 431 . For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic , a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic .	0	biology
 Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles .	1	biology
 Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms , but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population .	0	biology
 434 . The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying .	0	biology
 Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene , or locus , have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes .	0	biology
 Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .	0	biology
 437 . The dominant seed color is yellow ; therefore , the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds , respectively .	0	biology
 A Punnett square , devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett , can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies .	1	biology
 To prepare a Punnett square , all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top ( for one parent ) and side ( for the other parent ) of a grid , representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes .	0	biology
 440 . ( Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness . )	0	biology
 This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance , denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype .	1	biology
 The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers .	0	biology
 443 . Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .	0	biology
 All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .	1	biology
 The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild - type allele .	0	biology
 446 . Because of the location of the eye - color gene , reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios .	0	biology
 Males are said to be hemizygous , because they have only one allele for any X - linked characteristic .	1	biology
 Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males .	0	biology
 449 . Mendel ’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote , one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic .	1	biology
 Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype , the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively .	0	biology
 452 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .	1	biology
 The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .	1	biology
 Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants , one that has green , wrinkled seeds ( yyrr ) and another that has yellow , round seeds ( YYRR ) .	0	biology
 455 . That same year , Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Together , these observations led to the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance , which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance .	1	biology
 458 . Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .	0	biology
 Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .	1	biology
 Morgan and his colleagues , however , found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent ( AaBb × aabb ) , both parental and nonparental cases occurred .	0	biology
 461 . The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans .	0	biology
 A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .	1	biology
 To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 464 . For instance , Jacobsen Syndrome — which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects — is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11 .	1	biology
 Finally , the karyotype can pinpoint translocations , which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome .	1	biology
 Translocations are implicated in certain cancers , including chronic myelogenous leukemia .	0	biology
 467 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .	1	biology
 An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .	1	biology
 Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes .	0	biology
 470 . A chromosome inversion is the detachment , 180 ° rotation , and reinsertion of part of a chromosome .	1	biology
 Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear , or from the action of transposable elements ( special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences ) .	1	biology
 473 . A half century later , British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “ horizontally , ” rather than by descent .	0	biology
 In 1928 , he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation , a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell , thereby changing morphology and physiology .	1	biology
 He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterium that causes pneumonia .	1	biology
 476 . ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .	0	biology
 As the DNA opens up , Y - shaped structures called replication forks are formed .	0	biology
 Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .	0	biology
 479 . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .	1	biology
 Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .	0	biology
 DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 482 . Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .	0	biology
 The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand .	1	biology
 485 . The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I , and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides .	0	biology
 The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA ( that replaced the RNA primer ) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5 ' phosphate end of the other fragment .	1	biology
 488 . In another type of repair mechanism , nucleotide excision repair , enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3 ' and 5 ' ends of the incorrect base ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol .	0	biology
 491 . Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .	1	biology
 Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .	1	biology
 494 . These can be of two types , either transitions or transversions .	0	biology
 Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .	1	biology
 Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .	1	biology
 497 . The discovery of the enzyme telomerase ( [ link ] ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained .	0	biology
 The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built - in RNA template .	1	biology
 It attaches to the end of the chromosome , and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3 ' end of the DNA strand .	0	biology
 500 . In contrast , there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets ( 43 ) , which is far more than the number of amino acids .	0	biology
 Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate .	0	biology
 In other words , a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet .	0	biology
 503 . In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain , three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery .	1	biology
 These triplets are called nonsense codons , or stop codons .	0	biology
 Another codon , AUG , also has a special function .	0	biology
 506 . The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .	1	biology
 Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .	1	biology
 The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .	0	biology
 The only difference is that in mRNA , all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides .	0	biology
 509 . Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .	1	biology
 512 . A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription .	1	biology
 In most cases , promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate .	0	biology
 515 . Rho - independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand .	0	biology
 As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed , it encounters a region rich in C – G nucleotides .	0	biology
 518 . These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome .	0	biology
 For example , the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box ( GGCCAATCT ) at approximately -80 .	0	biology
 This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .	0	biology
 521 . For polynucleotide synthesis to occur , the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome .	0	biology
 This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT , which stands for “ facilitates chromatin transcription . ” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it .	1	biology
 Once the pre - mRNA is synthesized , the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes .	0	biology
 524 . .	0	biology
 The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG ( or rarely , GUG ) , links to a formylated methionine called fMet , and can also bind IF-2 .	1	biology
 Formylated methionine is inserted by	0	biology
 527 . Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A - site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P - site tRNA .	1	biology
 The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase , an RNA - based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit .	1	biology
 The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis , which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor .	0	biology
 530 . While the pre - mRNA is still being synthesized , a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5 ' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage .	0	biology
 This moiety ( functional group ) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation .	1	biology
 533 . If the process errs by even a single nucleotide , the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift , and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional .	0	biology
 The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Introns are removed and degraded while the pre - mRNA is still in the nucleus .	0	biology
 536 . The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors ( epigenetic level ) , when the RNA is transcribed ( transcriptional level ) , when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed ( post - transcriptional level ) , when the RNA is translated into protein ( translational level ) , or after the protein has been made ( post - translational level ) .	1	biology
 539 . coli need amino acids to survive .	0	biology
 Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment .	0	biology
 542 . A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene .	0	biology
 This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind .	1	biology
 When tryptophan is present in the cell , two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor , which changes shape to bind to the trp operator .	0	biology
 545 . coli .	0	biology
 When glucose levels decline in the cell , accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein ( CAP ) , a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars .	1	biology
 When cAMP binds to CAP , the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 548 . If a gene is to be transcribed , the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene .	0	biology
 This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins , called transcription factors , to bind to the promoter region , located just upstream of the gene , and initiate transcription .	0	biology
 If a gene is to remain turned off , or silenced , the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration .	0	biology
 551 . In some eukaryotic genes , there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription .	1	biology
 These regions , called enhancers , are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance .	0	biology
 They can be located upstream of a gene , within the coding region of the gene , downstream of a gene , or may be thousands of nucleotides away .	0	biology
 554 . If the RNA is stable , it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm . Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability .	0	biology
 Proteins , called RNA - binding proteins , or RBPs , can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein - coding region .	1	biology
 These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions , or UTRs .	1	biology
 557 . In addition to RBPs that bind to and control ( increase or decrease ) RNA stability , other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule .	0	biology
 These microRNAs , or miRNAs , are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length .	1	biology
 The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre - miRNAs .	0	biology
 560 . Like transcription , translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process .	0	biology
 In translation , the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex .	1	biology
 The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 563 . The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .	0	biology
 566 . Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete .	1	biology
 These proteins are moved to the proteasome , an organelle that functions to remove proteins , to be degraded ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One way to control gene expression , therefore , is to alter the longevity of the protein .	0	biology
 569 . Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement .	1	biology
 Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood .	0	biology
 572 . Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment , they can be mobilized by an electric field .	0	biology
 Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size , using this charge .	1	biology
 The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments .	0	biology
 575 . Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size .	0	biology
 The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .	0	biology
 578 . Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations ( such as Escherichia coli ) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism , such as antibiotic resistance ( the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics ) .	1	biology
 Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .	0	biology
 581 . Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature .	1	biology
 They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .	0	biology
 584 . Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism .	1	biology
 Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means , which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals ( parents ) , making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent .	1	biology
 587 . The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .	1	biology
 If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .	1	biology
 Bacteria , plants , and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic , medical , agricultural , and industrial purposes .	0	biology
 590 . Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease .	1	biology

 Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .	1	biology
 The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .	0	biology
 596 . Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes ( similar to a detailed road map ) .	0	biology
 A physical map is a representation of the physical distance , in nucleotides , between genes or genetic markers .	1	biology
 Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome .	0	biology
 599 . Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLP ) , variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) , microsatellite polymorphisms , and the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .	0	biology
 RFLPs ( sometimes pronounced “ rif - lips ” ) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments , which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis .	1	biology
 602 . This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency .	0	biology
 Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs .	1	biology
 The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping .	1	biology
 4617 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .	0	economic
 Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .	1	economic
 4620 . In the United States , the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person : Mollie Orshansky .	0	economic
 In 1963 , Orshansky , who was working for the Social Security Administration , published an article called “ Children of the Poor ” in a highly useful and dry - as - dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin .	0	economic

 Economists call this problem the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4626 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor .	1	economic
 Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .	0	economic
 4629 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .	1	economic
 This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .	0	economic
 4632 . Often called “ food stamps , ” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is a federally funded program , started in 1964 , in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food .	1	economic
 The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income , number of children , and other factors but , in general , households are expected to spend about 30 % of their own net income on food , and if 30 % of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet , then those households are eligible for SNAP.SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4635 . Medicaid was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government .	1	economic
 The federal government helps fund Medicaid , but each state is responsible for administering the program , determining the level of benefits , and determining eligibility .	0	economic
 4638 . For example , you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution .	0	economic
 [ link ] presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a Lorenz curve .	0	economic
 The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4644 . Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that , even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools , each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests , desires , talents , and efforts .	0	economic
 Some of those initiatives include those shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4647 . A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .	1	economic
 Thus , negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining . The subject of labor unions can be controversial .	1	economic
 Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers’ primary line of defense against efforts by profit - seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits .	0	economic
 4650 . Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record - keeping and computer - operated cabs for loading and unloading ships — changes which the union opposed , along with overtime pay .	0	economic
 President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft - Hartley Act — where a court can impose an 80-day “ cooling - off period ” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage .	1	economic
 Federal mediators were called in , and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015 .	0	economic
 4653 . The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions .	0	economic
 The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor - Management Relations Act of 1935 , which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so .	1	economic
 The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all - out production efforts needed during World War II .	0	economic
 4656 . Investigating the Black / White Earnings GapBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century .	0	economic
 Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker , regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker .	0	economic
 Moreover , blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities , which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs .	0	economic
 4659 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .	1	economic
 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .	1	economic
 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .	1	economic

 This type of redress is enforced by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) .	0	economic
 4665 . In August 2009 , many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall - style meetings to discuss President Obama ’s proposed changes to the U.S. healthcare system .	1	economic
 This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) or as the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but was more popularly known as Obamacare .	0	economic
 The bill ’s opponents’ claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $ 750 billion to the deficit , to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so - called “ death panels ” that decide which critically - ill patients receive care and which do not .	0	economic
 4668 . Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .	1	economic
 Let ’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods , labor , and financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold .	0	economic
 4671 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .	1	economic
 By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .	1	economic
 When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating , markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price .	0	economic

 A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion , because so much of this so - called “ quirky ” behavior is extremely common among us .	0	economic
 For example , a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $ 10 bill today , and also got an extra $ 10 in your paycheck , you should feel perfectly neutral .	0	economic
 4677 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .	1	economic
 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars , appliances and even houses .	0	economic
 4680 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 4683 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .	1	economic
 Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .	1	economic
 4686 . Unemployment insurance : Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance , which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time , usually six months , after they lose their jobs .	1	economic
 4689 . Workman ’s compensation insurance : Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds , typically run at the state level , that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job .	1	economic
 4692 . Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance .	1	economic
 For example , if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor , you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor ’s visit .	0	economic
 4695 . Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 For example , insurance might pay for 80 % of the costs of repairing a home after a fire , but the homeowner would pay the other 20 % .	0	economic
 4698 . Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high - risk or low - risk than the insurance company does .	1	economic
 This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high - risk tend to want to buy more insurance , without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk .	0	economic
 4701 . In March of 2010 , President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) .	0	economic
 This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013 .	0	economic
 4704 . Individuals can not , however , take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year , write a letter to General Motors or some other firm , and negotiate to invest their money with that firm .	0	economic
 Financial capital markets bridge this gap : that is , they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital .	1	economic
 Such financial markets include stocks , bonds , bank loans , and other financial investments .	0	economic
 4707 . They also provide advice on potential products , customers , and key employees .	0	economic
 Typically , a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms , and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs . The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year : as one example , venture capital firms invested more than $ 48.3 billion in 2014 , according to the National Venture Capital Association .	1	economic
 All early - stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big ; indeed , many of them will go out of business within a few months or years .	0	economic
 4710 . A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .	1	economic
 For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury .	1	economic
 4713 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .	0	economic
 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 4716 . First , a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public ( the public includes individuals , mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension funds ) .	0	economic
 A firm ’s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering ( IPO ) .	1	economic
 The IPO is important for two reasons .	0	economic
 4719 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .	1	economic
 A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .	1	economic
 4722 . Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance , the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives , fails , as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman Brothers shows . How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure ?	1	economic

 Risk measures the uncertainty of that project ’s profitability .	1	economic
 There are several types of risk , including default risk and interest rate risk .	0	economic
 4728 . Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs .	0	economic
 A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 4731 . In part , this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer .	0	economic
 In addition , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) protects the savings of the average person .	1	economic
 Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC , based on the size of its deposits .	0	economic

 Thus , a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification , which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies .	1	economic
 A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb : “ Do n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ” In any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse — but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value .	0	economic
 4743 . About two - thirds of U.S. households own their own home .	0	economic
 An owner ’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house .	0	economic
 For example , imagine that you buy a house for $ 200,000 , paying 10 % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ 180,000 .	0	economic

 4752 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic
 4755 . The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high , while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower .	0	economic
 One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by AARP , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance .	0	economic
 4758 . For example , policies that impose price controls — like rent control — may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords .	0	economic
 However , when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area , a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available .	0	economic
 4761 . Democracy is sometimes summed up ( and oversimplified ) in two words : “ Majority rule . ” When voters face three or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers .	1	economic
 4764 . The situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B , Choice B is preferred by a majority over Choice C , and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A is called a voting cycle .	1	economic
 It is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur .	0	economic
 4767 . In April 2009 , the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking it to investigate tire imports from China .	0	economic
 Under U.S. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States , as determined by the ITC , then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption .	0	economic
 4770 . Who buys all of this production ?	0	economic
 This demand can be divided into four main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports .	1	economic
 ( See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment . )	0	economic
 4773 . The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports ( X ) minus the dollar value of imports ( M ) , ( X – M ) .	1	economic
 The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .	1	economic
 If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 4776 . Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades , even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 .	0	economic
 As noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total GDP .	0	economic
 4779 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .	0	economic
 Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .	1	economic
 4782 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .	1	economic
 The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .	1	economic
 4785 . Similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced .	0	economic
 The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .	1	economic
 The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .	1	economic
 4788 . [ link ] shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960 .	0	economic
 Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .	0	economic
 4791 . A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 4794 . Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle .	1	economic
 It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough - to - peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960 .	0	economic
 4797 . Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	1	economic
 Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) equivalent exchange rates .	0	economic
 Market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets .	1	economic
 4800 . One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that , as of 1970 , only about 42 % of women participated in the paid labor force .	0	economic
 By the second decade of the 2000s , nearly 60 % of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .	0	economic
 As women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy , which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed .	0	economic
 4803 . Before the last two centuries , although rulers , nobles , and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries . Progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .	0	economic
 According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .	0	economic
 The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .	1	economic
 4806 . Economic growth depends on many factors .	0	economic
 Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently .	0	economic
 Laws must be clear , public , fair , enforced , and equally applicable to all members of society .	0	economic
 4809 . The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change .	0	economic
 Technological change is a combination of invention — advances in knowledge — and innovation , which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service .	1	economic
 For example , the transistor was invented in 1947 .	0	economic
 4812 . While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 ( around 3 % ) , it has slowed down since then .	0	economic
 Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages .	0	economic
 Over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce .	0	economic
 4815 . The category of technology is the “ joker in the deck . ” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation .	0	economic
 When most people think of new technology , the invention of new products like the laser , the smartphone , or some new wonder drug come to mind .	0	economic
 4818 . When society increases the level of capital per person , the result is called capital deepening .	1	economic
 The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker .	0	economic
 4821 . Some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence , in which their economies grow faster than those of high - income countries .	0	economic
 GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7 % per year in the 1990s and 2.3 % per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high - income countries of the world , which include the United States , Canada , the countries of the European Union , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .	0	economic
 4824 . How did these incomes increase ?	0	economic
 The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital .	1	economic
 Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence .	0	economic

 4833 . One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy .	0	economic
 If firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right .	0	economic
 4836 . In other words , these people are involuntarily unemployed .	0	economic
 What causes involuntary unemployment ?	0	economic
 4839 . One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract , which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble , and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong .	0	economic
 This wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times .	0	economic
 4842 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 4845 . In a market economy , some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that happened to make bad decisions ; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is desired ; a large customer who went broke ; or tough domestic or foreign competitors .	0	economic
 Conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees .	0	economic
 4848 . However , adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly .	0	economic
 Wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year .	0	economic
 In many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level .	0	economic
 4851 . Sure , the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive .	0	economic
 Sure , per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2014 , but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years ?	0	economic
 Not likely . A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand .	0	economic
 4854 . To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods .	0	economic
 Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 4857 . The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	0	economic
 In recent years , the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility .	0	economic
 4860 . As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending .	1	economic
 Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables .	1	economic
 In this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living .	0	economic
 4863 . There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	1	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 4866 . Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of 1920–1921 , the Great Depression , the recession of 1980–1982 , and the Great Recession in 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary , but not at an annual rate .	0	economic

 The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an adjustment for inflation .	0	economic
 4875 . The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles .	0	economic
 These plans are tax deferred , and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer , their 401(k ) comes with them .	0	economic
 To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners . However , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation .	0	economic
 4878 . Inflation can make long - term planning difficult .	0	economic
 In discussing unintended redistributions , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation .	0	economic
 Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty .	0	economic
 4881 . An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs .	0	economic
 Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation .	0	economic
 4884 . The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing .	0	economic
 Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972 , the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index .	0	economic
 Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	1	economic
 4887 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic
 4890 . A few decades ago , it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes , trains , and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade .	1	economic
 This measurement is called the merchandise trade balance .	0	economic
 In most high - income economies , including the United States , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services compose more than half .	0	economic
 4893 . Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) within the U.S. Department of Commerce , using a variety of different sources .	0	economic
 4896 . The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers , which are payments made by government , private charities , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received .	1	economic
 Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category , as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities .	0	economic

 4902 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 4905 . When the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital .	0	economic
 The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways .	0	economic
 4908 . A nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these two are actually quite separate .	0	economic
 It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports .	0	economic
 A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is exported .	1	economic
 4911 . The next three chapters take up this task .	0	economic
 This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium .	0	economic
 This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals .	1	economic
 4914 . The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy .	1	economic
 Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists . If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur .	1	economic
 To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .	0	economic
 2944 . Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century , the main features of the electrostatic force — the existence of two types of charge , the observation that like charges repel , unlike charges attract , and the decrease of force with distance — were eventually refined , and expressed as a mathematical formula .	1	physics
 The mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called Coulomb ’s law after the French physicist Charles Coulomb ( 1736–1806 ) , who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it .	1	physics
 2947 . For example , a charged rubber comb attracts neutral bits of paper from a distance via the Coulomb force .	0	physics
 It is very useful to think of an object being surrounded in space by a force field .	0	physics
 The force field carries the force to another object ( called a test object ) some distance away .	0	physics
 2950 . We pretend that there is a positive test charge , qq size 12{q } { } , at point O , which allows us to determine the direction of the fields E1E1 size 12{E rSub { size 8{1 } } } { } and E2E2 size 12{E rSub { size 8{2 } } } { } .	0	physics
 Once those fields are found , the total field can be determined using vector addition . Solution	0	physics

 These “ cathode rays ” collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them , resulting in the emission of electromagnetic ( EM ) radiation that makes the electrons’ path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode .

 Examples of neoconservativism in action are the 1980s U.S. campaigns in Central American countries to turn back communism under President Ronald Reagan , the Iraq War of 2003 led by President George W. Bush and his vice president Dick Cheney ( [ link ] ) , and the use of drones as counterterrorism weapons during the Obama administration . Heading to a going - away party for departing defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006 , former president George W. Bush ( left ) walks with then - vice president ( and former secretary of defense ) Dick Cheney ( center ) , the prototypical twenty - first century foreign policy neoconservative .	0	government
 Rumsfeld is on the right .	0	government
 7066 . The foreign policy environment from the end of World War II until the end of the Cold War in 1990 was dominated by a duel of superpowers between the United States and its Western allies on the one hand and the Soviet Union and the communist bloc of countries in the East on the other .	0	government
 Both superpowers developed thousands of weapons of mass destruction and readied for a potential world war to be fought with nuclear weapons .	0	government

 4319 . In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .	1	economic
 Fiscal policy , which involves government spending and taxes , is determined by a nation ’s legislative body .	1	economic
 Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done ( i.e. , tradition ) .	1	economic
 Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .	1	economic
 4334 . The Rise of GlobalizationRecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization , which is the expanding cultural , political , and economic connections between people around the world .	1	economic
 4337 . Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .	1	economic
 4343 . The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern .	1	economic
 An inefficient machine operates at high cost , while an efficient machine operates at lower cost , because it is not wasting energy or materials .	1	economic
 An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs , while an efficient organization meets schedules , is focused , and performs within budget .	1	economic
 4358 . The third theme is economic efficiency , or getting the most benefit from scarce resources .	1	economic
 Elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable .	1	economic
 4364 . The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4370 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .	1	economic
 4373 . Constant unitary elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent .	1	economic
 4376 . Income Elasticity of DemandThe income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income . Income elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeIncome elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeFor most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm .	1	economic
 4391 . Variable costs , on the other hand , are incurred in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost .	1	economic
 If we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit , also known as the firm ’s profit margin .	1	economic
 More precisely , the long - run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output .	1	economic
 4406 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .	1	economic
 The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 A demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [ link ] , with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4412 . Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price , shown on the vertical axis , and quantity , shown on the horizontal axis .	1	economic
 4418 . The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .	1	economic
 A product whose demand rises when income rises , and vice versa , is called a normal good .	1	economic
 A substitute is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service .	1	economic
 4436 . Laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls .	1	economic
 4442 . The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate , under the ceteris paribus assumption .	1	economic
 4448 . Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods : now or in the future .	1	economic
 Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices .	1	economic
 This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility , which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added .	1	economic
 When the price of good 1 is divided by the price of good 2 , at the utility - maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2 .	1	economic
 As defined in the chapter on Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity , goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed . However , depending on Kimberly ’s preferences , a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines .	1	economic
 4466 . The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .	1	economic
 The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .	1	economic
 The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward - bending supply curve for labor , which is the situation of high - wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still - higher wage by working fewer hours .	1	economic
 4475 . We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain .	1	economic
 4478 . Firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur : ( 1 ) many firms produce identical products ; ( 2 ) many buyers are available to buy the product , and many sellers are available to sell the product ; ( 3 ) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold ; and ( 4 ) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions — in other words , there is free entry and exit into and out of the market .	1	economic
 When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry . Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee .	1	economic
 4490 . For a decreasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience lower costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a lower price than before .	1	economic
 In the case of monopoly , one firm produces all of the output in a market .	1	economic
 4496 . One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .	1	economic
 The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .	1	economic
 4499 . A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good , like Chiquita bananas , Chevrolet cars , or the Nike “ swoosh ” that appears on shoes and athletic gear .	1	economic
 4502 . Taken together , this combination of patents , trademarks , copyrights , and trade secret law is called intellectual property , because it implies ownership over an idea , concept , or image , not a physical piece of property like a house or a car .	1	economic
 4508 . [ link ] repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from [ link ] , and adds two more columns : Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold .	1	economic
 4514 . Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are distinctive in some way .	1	economic
 4517 . A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition .	1	economic
 4529 . When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .	1	economic
 A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .	1	economic
 4532 . Because of the complexity of oligopoly , which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how oligopolies behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures .	1	economic
 Instead , economists use game theory , a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do .	1	economic
 4541 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .	1	economic
 When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .	1	economic
 In 1914 , the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions ( where the outcome would be to “ substantially lessen competition ” in an industry ) , price discrimination ( where different customers are charged different prices for the same product ) , and tied sales ( where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product ) .	1	economic
 4547 . An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .	1	economic
 A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization .	1	economic
 4553 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .	1	economic
 Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .	1	economic
 A related , but not identical , concept is called bundling , where two or more products are sold as one .	1	economic
 A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand .	1	economic
 4562 . They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers accordingly .	1	economic
 4565 . One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow .	1	economic
 4571 . Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	1	economic
 In effect , command - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account . Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment .	1	economic
 4580 . A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits .	1	economic
 4586 . The definition of ecotourism is a little vague .	1	economic
 Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material .	1	economic
 4592 . The tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) such as the one shown in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4595 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .	1	economic
 4601 . The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	1	economic
 4607 . Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .	1	economic
 The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .	1	economic
 Sickle - cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells , which are normally round , take on a crescent - like shape ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An allele is a specific version of a gene .	1	psychology
 In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .	1	psychology
 For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts .	1	psychology
 A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene .	1	psychology
 3332 . In another approach to gene - environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways .	1	psychology
 Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .	1	psychology
 This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it , while stopping larger or highly charged molecules .	1	psychology
 The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs .	1	psychology
 This difference in charge across the membrane , called the membrane potential , provides energy for the signal .	1	psychology
 If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential .	1	psychology
 3362 . Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .	1	psychology
 An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .	1	psychology
 3365 . The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control .	1	psychology

 Therefore , the lower on the spine damage is , the fewer functions an injured individual loses . The Two HemispheresThe surface of the brain , known as the cerebral cortex , is very uneven , characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps , known as gyri ( singular : gyrus ) , and grooves , known as sulci ( singular : sulcus ) , shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 3374 . The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons .	1	psychology
 It contains the motor cortex , which is involved in planning and coordinating movement ; the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for higher - level cognitive functioning ; and Broca ’s area , which is essential for language production .	1	psychology
 3380 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .	1	psychology
 It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .	1	psychology
 3383 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .	1	psychology
 The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology

 The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .	1	psychology
 3404 . In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field .	1	psychology
 3407 . The endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Like neurotransmitters , hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal .	1	psychology
 3410 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .	1	psychology
 The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .	1	psychology
 The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution ’s administration , scientists , and community members ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An IACUC consists of institutional administrators , scientists , veterinarians , and community members .	1	psychology
 A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction .	1	psychology
 Or , we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch , ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false ; this is known as confirmation bias .	1	psychology
 The experimental group gets the experimental manipulation — that is , the treatment or variable being tested ( in this case , violent TV images)—and the control group does not .	1	psychology
 An independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter .	1	psychology

 Longitudinal research is a research design in which data - gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time .	1	psychology
 Scientific knowledge is empirical : It is grounded in objective , tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again , regardless of who is observing . While behavior is observable , the mind is not .	1	psychology
 3464 . Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .	1	psychology
 Basically , ideas ( in the form of theories and hypotheses ) are tested against the real world ( in the form of empirical observations ) , and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world , and so on .	1	psychology
 3467 . A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct , and it is often worded as an if - then statement ( e.g. , if I study all night , I will get a passing grade on the test ) .	1	psychology
 3470 . Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ) ; in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .	1	psychology

 Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .	1	psychology
 3491 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors . This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Counseling psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional , social , vocational , and health - related outcomes in individuals who are considered psychologically healthy .	1	psychology
 Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .	1	psychology
 3509 . The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button .	1	psychology
 Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .	1	psychology
 Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .	1	psychology
 A circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours .	1	psychology
 3524 . These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person ’s chronotype , and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation ( Taillard , Philip , Coste , Sagaspe , & Bioulac , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Sleep regulation refers to the brain ’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world .	1	psychology
 Rotating shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis .	1	psychology
 Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep - deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep .	1	psychology
 Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well ( [ link]).This is a segment of a polysonograph ( PSG ) , a recording of several physical variables during sleep .	1	psychology
 Theta waves are even lower frequency ( 4–7 Hz ) , higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves .	1	psychology

 3548 . In sleepwalking , or somnambulism , the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile .	1	psychology
 3551 . Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment ( Mahowald & Schenck , 2000 ) .	1	psychology
 3554 . Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .	1	psychology
 In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .	1	psychology
 In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .	1	psychology
 In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 3563 . Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued .	1	psychology
 Methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available ( e.g. , medications containing pseudoephedrine , a compound found in many over - the - counter cold and flu remedies ) .	1	psychology
 Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .	1	psychology
 3575 . A hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual experiences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3578 . Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli .	1	psychology
 Under quiet conditions , the hair cells ( the receptor cells of the inner ear ) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away ( Galanter , 1962).It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness — these are called subliminal messages .	1	psychology
 Bottom - up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input .	1	psychology
 Failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called inattentional blindness .	1	psychology
 Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second .	1	psychology
 Loudness is measured in terms of decibels ( dB ) , a logarithmic unit of sound intensity .	1	psychology
 The cornea is the transparent covering over the eye .	1	psychology

 The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .	1	psychology
 There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot : Even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot , we do not see it .	1	psychology
 5233 . Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .	1	economic
 Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .	1	economic
 Instead , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade .	1	economic
 The United States also participates in some less - prominent regional trading agreements , like the Caribbean Basin Initiative , which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries , and a free trade agreement with Israel .	1	economic
 A function describes a relationship .	1	economic
 5251 . The concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between two variables .	1	economic

 5260 . This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .	1	economic
 In short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution — that is , the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods .	1	economic
 The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out substitutes .	1	economic

 The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap .	1	economic
 One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .	1	economic
 Conversely , if a situation is inefficient , it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others . Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved .	1	economic
 The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .	1	economic
 In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .	1	economic
