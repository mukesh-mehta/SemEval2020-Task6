 In this textbook , the fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length , mass , time , and electric current .	0	physics
 2685 . The SI unit for length is the meter ( abbreviated m ) ; its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and precise .	0	physics
 The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole .	0	physics

 When two physical quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph , the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable .	0	physics
 If we call the horizontal axis the xx size 12{x } { } -axis and the vertical axis the yy size 12{y } { } -axis , as in [ link ] , a straight - line graph has the general formy = mx+b.y = mx+b .	0	physics

 2730 . Analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods .	0	physics
 Part of the graphical technique is retained , because vectors are still represented by arrows for easy visualization .	0	physics
 2733 . Rather than contradicting our experience , Newton ’s first law of motion states that there must be a cause ( which is a net external force ) for there to be any change in velocity ( either a change in magnitude or direction ) .	0	physics

 For example , friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice .	0	physics
 2748 . The physicist chooses Earth because it is very nearly an inertial frame of reference — one in which all forces are real ( that is , in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin ) .	0	physics
 In such a frame of reference , Newton ’s laws of motion take the form given in Dynamics : Newton 's Laws of Motion The car is a non - inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side .	0	physics
 The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin .	0	physics
 2751 . A person standing next to the merry - go - round sees the ball moving straight and the merry - go - round rotating underneath it .	0	physics
 In the merry - go - round ’s frame of reference , we explain the apparent curve to the right by using a fictitious force , called the Coriolis force , that causes the ball to curve to the right .	0	physics
 The fictitious Coriolis force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply Newton ’s Laws in non - inertial frames of reference .

 2778 . In [ link ] , a very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the tennis ball .	0	physics
 A small force could cause the same change in momentum , but it would have to act for a much longer time .	0	physics

 He devised a theoretical cycle , now called the Carnot cycle , which is the most efficient cyclical process possible .	0	physics
 The second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the Carnot cycle , and so what Carnot actually discovered was this fundamental law .	0	physics

 The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly ; this enables an immediate response , such as , Take your hand off the stove !	0	biology
 These water - filled channels allow small signaling molecules , called intracellular mediators , to diffuse between the two cells .	0	biology
 Small molecules , such as calcium ions ( Ca2 + ) , are able to move between cells , but large molecules like proteins and DNA can not fit through the channels .	0	biology

 What happens between these two events depends on the organism .	0	biology
 415 . Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle .	0	biology
 Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid .	0	biology
 418 . In 1866 , he published his work , Experiments in Plant Hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn . Mendel ’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed , incorrectly , that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring ; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation .	0	biology
 Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .	0	biology
 In the pea , which is naturally self - pollinating , this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety .	0	biology
 424 . Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .	0	biology
 He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2 , or second filial , generation .	0	biology
 Mendel ’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations , and so on , but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel ’s postulates . In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns , Mendel crossed plants that were true - breeding for violet flower color with plants true - breeding for white flower color ( the P generation ) .	0	biology
 427 . He called these , respectively , dominant and recessive traits .	0	biology
 430 . On the other hand , the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway .	0	biology
 An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .	1	biology
 Mendel ’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype .	0	biology
 436 . When fertilization occurs between two true - breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic , the process is called a monohybrid cross , and the resulting offspring are monohybrids .	1	biology
 Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic .	0	biology
 439 . Of course , doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical .	0	biology
 Instead , geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 442 . Although individual humans ( and all diploid organisms ) can only have two alleles for a given gene , multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed .	0	biology
 Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .	1	biology
 All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .	0	biology
 445 . Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis , the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes .	0	biology
 When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome , but not on the Y chromosome , it is said to be X - linked .	1	biology
 448 . For instance , the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote . A single copy of the wild - type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival .	0	biology
 The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote ; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age .	1	biology
 Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form .	0	biology
 451 . Mendel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .	1	biology
 The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .	0	biology
 454 . In epistasis , the interaction between genes is antagonistic , such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another .	1	biology
 “ Epistasis ” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “ standing upon . ” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking .	0	biology
 457 . If the genes are unlinked , the individual should produce AB , Ab , aB , and ab gametes with equal frequencies , according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment .	1	biology
 Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .	1	biology
 Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .	1	biology
 460 . Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked , but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur .	0	biology
 Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units , or centimorgans ( cM ) , in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.By representing alleles in a linear map , Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked ( recombination frequency = 0 ) to being perfectly unlinked ( recombination frequency = 0.5 ) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome .	1	biology
 Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross .	0	biology
 463 . In a given species , chromosomes can be identified by their number , size , centromere position , and banding pattern .	0	biology
 In a human karyotype , autosomes or “ body chromosomes ” ( all of the non – sex chromosomes ) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest ( chromosome 1 ) to smallest ( chromosome 22 ) .	1	biology
 The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes .	0	biology
 466 . An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .	1	biology
 An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .	1	biology
 469 . Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes , variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects .	0	biology
 In part , this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation .	0	biology
 Early in development , when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells ( relative to trillions in the newborn ) , one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent ( dormant ) structure called a Barr body .	1	biology
 472 . A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different , nonhomologous chromosome .	1	biology
 Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences .	0	biology
 475 . The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site .	0	biology
 An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs .	1	biology
 ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .	0	biology
 478 . The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end .	0	biology
 Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .	1	biology
 Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .	0	biology
 481 . This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .	0	biology
 The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .	1	biology
 Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .	0	biology
 484 . The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .	1	biology
 Topoisomerase prevents the over - winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up ; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it .	1	biology
 As synthesis proceeds , the RNA primers are replaced by DNA .	0	biology
 487 . Some errors are not corrected during replication , but are instead corrected after replication is completed ; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it ; this is then replaced by the correct base .	0	biology
 490 . Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .	0	biology
 Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .	1	biology
 Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .	1	biology
 493 . Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .	1	biology
 Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .	1	biology
 The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions , in which one base is replaced by another .	1	biology
 496 . The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres , which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene .	1	biology
 In a way , these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide .	0	biology
 499 . The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence .	0	biology
 However , the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear , such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1 , nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2 , and so on . Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA .	0	biology
 Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein .	1	biology
 502 . These nucleotide triplets are called codons .	1	biology
 The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation , the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained .	0	biology
 505 . Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .	0	biology
 The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .	1	biology
 Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .	1	biology
 The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .	1	biology
 508 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .	1	biology
 Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .	1	biology
 511 . Without σ , the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish .	0	biology
 The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme .	1	biology
 514 . One is protein - based and the other is RNA - based .	0	biology
 Rho - dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein , which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain .	1	biology
 Near the end of the gene , the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls .	0	biology
 517 . RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus .	0	biology
 This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre - rRNA , transfer pre - RNAs ( pre - tRNAs ) , and small nuclear pre - RNAs .	0	biology
 The tRNAs have a critical role in translation ; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain .	0	biology
 520 . Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed .	0	biology
 Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation .	1	biology
 523 . The corresponding amino acid must be added later , once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm .	0	biology
 Through the process of tRNA “ charging , ” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases .	1	biology
 At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids ; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species .	0	biology
 526 . Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG , but this is not always the case .	0	biology
 According to Kozak ’s rules , the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon .	1	biology
 Kozak ’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes : 5'-gccRccAUGG-3 ' .	0	biology
 529 . Usually , this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides .	0	biology
 The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this .	0	biology
 532 . Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons , which correspond to protein - coding sequences ( ex - on signifies that they are expressed ) , and intervening sequences called introns ( int - ron denotes their intervening role ) , which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre - mRNA during processing .	1	biology
 Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins .	0	biology
 535 . All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA .	0	biology
 The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression .	1	biology
 Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi - cellular organism , each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed .	0	biology
 538 . In prokaryotic cells , there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons : repressors , activators , and inducers .	0	biology
 Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus , whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus .	1	biology
 Finally , inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate .	1	biology
 541 . The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon .	0	biology
 Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site .	0	biology
 This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription .	1	biology
 544 . Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules , there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them .	0	biology
 For example , when glucose is scarce , E .	0	biology
 547 . One such sugar source is lactose .	0	biology
 The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment .	1	biology
 CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon .	1	biology
 550 . When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .	1	biology
 The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .	1	biology
 Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed .	0	biology
 553 . The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) .	1	biology
 The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .	1	biology
 Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm , the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled .	0	biology
 556 . Rather , these are regions that regulate mRNA localization , stability , and protein translation .	0	biology
 The region just before the protein - coding region is called the 5 ' UTR , whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3 ' UTR ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule , depending on the specific RBP that binds .	0	biology
 559 . These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .	0	biology
 Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .	1	biology
 RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA .	0	biology
 562 . The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	0	biology
 565 . At this point , when the initiator complex is assembled , the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released .	0	biology
 The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA .	0	biology
 The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation .	0	biology
 568 . An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc .	0	biology
 Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett ’s Lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph system .	1	biology
 Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably .	0	biology
 571 . Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .	1	biology
 Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .	1	biology
 The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol .	0	biology
 574 . Nucleic acid samples , such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts , can be probed for the presence of certain sequences .	0	biology
 Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection .	1	biology
 Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size .	1	biology
 577 . Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation .	0	biology
 In the bacterial context , the fragment of DNA from the human genome ( or the genome of another organism that is being studied ) is referred to as foreign DNA , or a transgene , to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium , which is called the host DNA .	1	biology
 580 . The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .	0	biology
 Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner ; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA .	1	biology
 Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA , such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single - stranded overhang .	0	biology
 583 . Unicellular organisms , such as bacteria and yeast , naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission ; this is known as cellular cloning .	1	biology
 The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis , which creates an exact replica of the genetic material .	0	biology
 586 . The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .	0	biology
 The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .	1	biology
 If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .	1	biology
 589 . The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing .	1	biology
 Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease - causing gene , family members are advised to undergo genetic testing .	0	biology
 592 . Genomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species .	1	biology
 Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .	1	biology
 595 . Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .	0	biology
 A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co - segregates ( shows genetic linkage ) with a specific trait .	1	biology
 Early geneticists called this linkage analysis .	0	biology
 598 . For example , in experiments performed on the garden pea , it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant ’s pollen were linked traits , and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome .	0	biology
 The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination , which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA , such as nonsister chromatids .	1	biology
 Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes .	1	biology
 601 . It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .	0	biology
 Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation , such as x - rays , to break the DNA into fragments .	1	biology
 The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments .	0	biology
 3617 . Generally , you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D .	0	psychology
 When we do this , we are relying on a number of monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye .	1	psychology
 If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues .	0	psychology
 3620 . The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum . The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) .	1	psychology
 The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .	1	psychology
 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .	0	psychology
 The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea .	1	psychology
 3626 . The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing .	0	psychology
 Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 3629 . Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .	1	psychology
 Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates ( Grothe et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3635 . One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 3638 . Taste ( gustation ) and smell ( olfaction ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe .	0	psychology
 There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses .	0	psychology
 3644 . Many species respond to chemical messages , known as pheromones , sent by another individual ( Wysocki & Preti , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate .	0	psychology
 3650 . Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain .	1	psychology
 This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain ( or congenital analgesia ) .	0	psychology
 While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain .	0	psychology
 3653 . Wertheimer , and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka , who later became his partners , believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli .	1	psychology
 This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology .	0	psychology
 The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts .	0	psychology
 3656 . We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3659 . According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above .	0	psychology
 You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3662 . Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .	0	psychology
 For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 3665 . Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment .	0	psychology
 But unlike instincts and reflexes , learned behaviors involve change and experience : learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience .	1	psychology
 In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience .	0	psychology
 3668 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	0	psychology
 3671 . The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .	1	psychology
 The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .	1	psychology
 Before conditioning , think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this :	0	psychology
 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants’ footsteps .	0	psychology
 The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) .	1	psychology
 In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food .	0	psychology
 3677 . Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) .	1	psychology
 Here ’s how it works .	0	psychology
 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) .	0	psychology
 When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination .	1	psychology
 In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus .	0	psychology
 3683 . John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism .	0	psychology
 Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century , which incorporates elements of Pavlov ’s classical conditioning ( Hunt , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 3686 . Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .	0	psychology
 His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .	1	psychology
 3689 . In negative reinforcement , an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior .	1	psychology
 For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt .	0	psychology
 3692 . In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) .	0	psychology
 In negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior .	1	psychology
 For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy .	0	psychology
 3695 . A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer .	1	psychology
 Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal .	0	psychology
 3698 . Now let ’s combine these four terms .	0	psychology
 A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time .	1	psychology
 For example , June undergoes major surgery in a hospital .	0	psychology
 3701 . In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a reward varies .	1	psychology
 This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule .	0	psychology
 3704 . As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along .	0	psychology
 This is known as latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze .	1	psychology
 Have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game ?	0	psychology
 3707 . Imitation is much more obvious in humans , but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery ?	0	psychology
 Consider Claire ’s experience with observational learning .	0	psychology
 3710 . On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .	1	psychology
 This is called vicarious punishment .	0	psychology
 For example , imagine that four - year - old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in .	0	psychology
 3713 . Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think .	1	psychology
 It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .	0	psychology
 3716 . In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial .	0	psychology
 Natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences .	1	psychology
 For example , if you live in Essex Junction , Vermont , you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow .	0	psychology
 3719 . There are several types of schemata .	0	psychology
 A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave ( Callero , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter .	0	psychology
 3722 . Language , be it spoken , signed , or written , has specific components : a lexicon and grammar .	0	psychology
 Lexicon refers to the words of a given language .	1	psychology
 Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	0	psychology
 3725 . A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .	1	psychology
 Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .	1	psychology
 We use semantics and syntax to construct language .	0	psychology
 3728 . However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 3731 . A problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution .	0	psychology
 Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3734 . A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy .	0	psychology
 While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result , a heuristic is a general problem - solving framework ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) .	1	psychology
 You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems .	0	psychology
 3737 . Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for .	1	psychology
 During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft .	0	psychology
 3740 . For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .	1	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .	1	psychology
 3746 . James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 From a biological perspective , an instinct is a species - specific pattern of behavior that is not learned .	1	psychology
 There was , however , considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct .	0	psychology
 3749 . Researchers Robert Yerkes ( pronounced “ Yerk - EES ” ) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 This relationship is known as Yerkes - Dodson law , which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower .	1	psychology
 3752 . Maslow ’s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives , individual characteristics , or social contexts , Abraham Maslow ( 1943 ) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social .	0	psychology
 These needs are often depicted as a pyramid ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3758 . Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation .	1	psychology
 Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well - developed short story .	0	psychology
 3764 . Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .	1	psychology
 In contrast , convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well - established answer or solution to a problem ( Cropley , 2006 ; Gilford , 1967 )	1	psychology
 3767 . The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain .	0	psychology
 Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( Ahima & Antwi , 2008 ; Woods & D’Alessio , 2008 ) .	0	psychology
 3770 . OBESITYWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered overweight or obese .	0	psychology
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .	1	psychology
 3773 . In cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity , bariatric surgery may be recommended .	0	psychology
 Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight reduction , and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten and/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed ( [ link ] ) ( Mayo Clinic , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 A recent meta - analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non - surgical treatment for obesity in the two - years immediately following the procedure , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( Gloy et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3776 . As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fifth edition , Binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 Unlike with bulimia , eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior , such as purging , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of guilt and embarrassment .	0	psychology
 3779 . Physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers .	0	psychology
 Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality , Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The results of some of these efforts were published in two books — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — which were published in 1948 and 1953 , respectively ( Bullough , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 3782 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 3785 . Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 Orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension .	0	psychology
 In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 3788 . In reality , these are two related , but different , issues .	0	psychology
 Gender identity refers to one ’s sense of being male or female .	1	psychology
 Generally , our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 3791 . While you ’re likely familiar with the term “ IQ ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does IQ really mean ?	0	psychology
 IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence .	1	psychology
 You ’ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more aptly , intelligences ) .	0	psychology
 3794 . Interestingly , the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect .	0	psychology
 Named after James Flynn , who was among the first to describe this trend , the Flynn effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last .	1	psychology
 Flynn himself argues , however , that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se ( Flynn , Shaughnessy , & Fulgham , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3797 . Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents .	0	psychology
 Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence .	0	psychology
 The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well - known twin studies .	0	psychology
 3800 . Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly .	1	psychology
 The physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person .	0	psychology
 3803 . Emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional .	0	psychology
 Mood , on the other hand , refers to a prolonged , less intense , affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience .	1	psychology
 Mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion ( Beedie , Terry , Lane , & Devonport , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3806 . Other theorists , however , doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience .	0	psychology
 Thus , the Cannon - Bard theory of emotion was developed .	0	psychology
 According to this view , physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously , yet independently ( Lang , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 3809 . The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate .	0	psychology
 Lazarus ( 1991 ) developed the cognitive - mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus .	1	psychology
 This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious .	0	psychology
 3812 . The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The basolateral complex has dense connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain .	1	psychology
 It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 3815 . Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion .	0	psychology
 A cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable ( Malatesta & Haviland , 1982 ) .	1	psychology
 Therefore , people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion .	0	psychology
 3818 . We also use the tone of our voices , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states .	0	psychology
 Body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language , even if we ’re not consciously aware of it ( de Gelder , 2006 ; Tamietto et al . , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3821 . In the centuries after Galen , other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types , most prominently Immanuel Kant ( in the 18th century ) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( in the 19th century ) ( Eysenck , 2009 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ; Wundt , 1874/1886 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Kant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories ( Eysenck , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 3824 . LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESSTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He said that only about one - tenth of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious .	0	psychology
 Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access ( Freud , 1923 ) .	1	psychology
 3827 . It strives for perfection and judges our behavior , leading to feelings of pride or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of guilt .	0	psychology
 In contrast to the instinctual i d and the rule - based superego , the ego is the rational part of our personality .	1	psychology
 It ’s what Freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others .	0	psychology
 3830 . Eventually you forget about it .	0	psychology
 Similarly , in the human psyche , if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with , it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness ( Freud , 1920 ) .	0	psychology
 This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas .	0	psychology
 3833 . For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .	0	psychology
 In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .	1	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 3836 . In the oral stage ( birth to 1 year ) , pleasure is focused on the mouth .	1	psychology
 Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking ( nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs ) play a large part in a baby ’s first year of life .	0	psychology
 3839 . Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period ( 6 years to puberty ) .	1	psychology
 This period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits , such as school , friendships , hobbies , and sports .	0	psychology
 3842 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology
 3845 . Carl Jung ( [ link ] ) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud , who later split off from Freud and developed his own theory , which he called analytical psychology .	0	psychology
 The focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought , and experience within one ’s personality .	1	psychology
 3848 . Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst .	0	psychology
 During the Great Depression , Horney moved from Germany to the United States , and subsequently moved away from Freud ’s teachings .	0	psychology
 3851 . If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today , more than likely you could recall this information quite easily .	0	psychology
 This is known as automatic processing , or the encoding of details like time , space , frequency , and the meaning of words .	1	psychology
 Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness .	0	psychology
 3854 . Visual encoding is the encoding of images , and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds , words in particular .	1	psychology
 To see how visual encoding works , read over this list of words : car , level , dog , truth , book , value .	0	psychology
 3857 . Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .	1	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 3860 . One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short - term memory storage .	0	psychology
 J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s : you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color , which is called the Stroop effect .	1	psychology
 In other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red .	0	psychology
 3863 . Long - term memory ( LTM ) is the continuous storage of information .	1	psychology
 Unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of LTM has no limits .	0	psychology
 3866 . Procedural memory is a type of implicit memory : it stores information about how to do things .	1	psychology
 It is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to brush your teeth , how to drive a car , how to swim the crawl ( freestyle ) stroke .	0	psychology
 3869 . Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced .	1	psychology
 The concept of episodic memory was first proposed about 40 years ago ( Tulving , 1972 ) .	0	psychology
 3872 . How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ?	0	psychology
 The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval .	1	psychology
 This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer ’s hard drive .	0	psychology
 3875 . The third form of retrieval is relearning , and it ’s just what it sounds like .	0	psychology
 It involves learning information that you previously learned .	1	psychology
 3878 . First , let ’s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation .	0	psychology
 The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3881 . There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as epinephrine , dopamine , serotonin , glutamate , and acetylcholine ( Myhrer , 2003 ) .	0	psychology
 There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( Blockland , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 Although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories .	0	psychology
 3884 . In other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning .	0	psychology
 B. F. Skinner , a strict behaviorist , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the enduring , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists .	0	psychology
 3887 . In contrast to Skinner ’s idea that the environment alone determines behavior , Bandura ( 1990 ) proposed the concept of reciprocal determinism , in which cognitive processes , behavior , and context all interact , each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned , including beliefs , expectations , and personality characteristics .	1	psychology
 3890 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .	0	psychology
 Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .	1	psychology
 In Rotter ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external locus of control ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3893 . Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma , such as a blow to the head .	0	psychology
 With anterograde amnesia , you can not remember new information , although you can remember information and events that happened prior to your injury .	1	psychology
 The hippocampus is usually affected ( McLeod , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3896 . Because memory is so fragile , witnesses can be easily ( and often accidentally ) misled due to the problem of suggestibility .	0	psychology
 Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories .	1	psychology
 In the fall of 2002 , a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gas station , leaving Home Depot , and walking down the street .	0	psychology
 3899 . She has studied false memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse .	0	psychology
 Loftus also developed the misinformation effect paradigm , which holds that after exposure to incorrect information , a person may misremember the original event .	1	psychology
 3902 . Let ’s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors : transience , which means that memories can fade over time .	1	psychology
 Here ’s an example of how this happens .	0	psychology
 3905 . Now let ’s take a look at the three errors of distortion : misattribution , suggestibility , and bias .	0	psychology
 Misattribution happens when you confuse the source of your information .	1	psychology
 Let ’s say Alejandro was dating Lucia and they saw the first Hobbit movie together .	0	psychology
 3908 . When the new year starts , do you find you accidentally write the previous year ?	0	psychology
 These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .	1	psychology
 Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .	1	psychology
 3911 . This perspective focuses on how healthy people develop .	0	psychology
 One pioneering humanist , Abraham Maslow , studied people who he considered to be healthy , creative , and productive , including Albert Einstein , Eleanor Roosevelt , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , and others .	0	psychology
 Maslow ( 1950 , 1970 ) found that such people share similar characteristics , such as being open , creative , loving , spontaneous , compassionate , concerned for others , and accepting of themselves .	0	psychology
 1516 . The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks .	0	biology
 These layers form three distinct regions : an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids , a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids , and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens .	0	biology
 1519 . The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans , as visible in the micrograph shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin .	0	biology
 1522 . While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands , the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function .	0	biology
 Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone .	0	biology
 1528 . As blood osmolarity decreases , a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus , and ADH secretion is reduced .	0	biology
 ADH release can be reduced by certain substances , including alcohol , which can cause increased urine production and dehydration . Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus .	0	biology
 If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH , water can not be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine .	0	biology
 1534 . FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin , which is released by the testes .	0	biology
 LH stimulates production of the sex hormones ( androgens ) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell - stimulating hormone .	0	biology
 1537 . Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .	0	biology
 PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .	0	biology
 The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks .	0	biology
 1540 . This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .	0	biology
 This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells , causing high levels of blood glucose , or hyperglycemia ( high sugar ) .	1	biology
 High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine , resulting in glucose being lost in urine .	0	biology
 1543 . When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .	0	biology
 Glucagon raises blood glucose levels , eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect , by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis .	1	biology
 Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells .	0	biology
 1546 . T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .	0	biology
 1549 . Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones .	0	biology
 Hypothyroidism , underproduction of the thyroid hormones , can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain , sensitivity to cold , and reduced mental activity , among other symptoms .	1	biology
 In children , hypothyroidism can cause cretinism , which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects .	0	biology
 1552 . The hormone calcitonin , which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid , has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does PTH .	0	biology
 Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts , stimulating osteoblasts , and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys .	1	biology
 1555 . Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs .	0	biology
 The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus . The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin - like growth factors ( IGFs ) or somatomedins , which are a family of growth - promoting proteins produced by the liver , which stimulates tissue growth .	1	biology
 IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood , allowing the formation of new proteins , particularly in skeletal muscle cells , cartilage cells , and other target cells , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1558 . In some cases , individuals are under 30 inches in height .	0	biology
 Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children , causing excessive growth .	0	biology
 In some documented cases , individuals can reach heights of over eight feet .	0	biology
 1561 . Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .	1	biology
 The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .	0	biology
 How do these hormones provide a burst of energy ?	0	biology
 1567 . FSH stimulates egg maturation in females , while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone .	0	biology
 Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova .	1	biology
 In females , the pituitary also produces prolactin , which stimulates milk production after childbirth , and oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let - down during suckling . Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use .	1	biology
 1570 . An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard , mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms .	1	biology
 An example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges .	0	biology
 1573 . The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .	0	biology
 The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity , which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck .	1	biology
 The eight cranial bones are the frontal bone , two parietal bones , two temporal bones , occipital bone , sphenoid bone , and the ethmoid bone .	0	biology
 1576 . Although it is not found in the skull , the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton .	0	biology
 The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck .	1	biology
 It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw , larynx , and tongue .	0	biology
 1579 . The thoracic cage , also known as the ribcage , is the skeleton of the chest , and consists of the ribs , sternum , thoracic vertebrae , and costal cartilages ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity , including the heart and lungs .	0	biology
 1582 . The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs ( which function to grasp and manipulate objects ) and the lower limbs ( which permit locomotion ) .	0	biology
 It also includes the pectoral girdle , or shoulder girdle , that attaches the upper limbs to the body , and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1585 . The scapulae are flat , triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle .	1	biology
 They support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint .	0	biology
 1588 . It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .	0	biology
 The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones : the ulna and the radius .	1	biology
 The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .	1	biology
 1591 . The radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other , which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb .	0	biology
 The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus ( wrist ) , the five bones of the metacarpus ( palm ) , and the 14 bones of the phalanges ( digits ) .	0	biology
 Each digit consists of three phalanges , except for the thumb , when present , which has only two .	0	biology
 1594 . The lower limb consists of the thigh , the leg , and the foot .	1	biology
 The bones of the lower limb are the femur ( thigh bone ) , patella ( kneecap ) , tibia and fibula ( bones of the leg ) , tarsals ( bones of the ankle ) , and metatarsals and phalanges ( bones of the foot ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1597 . It improves knee extension by reducing friction .	0	biology
 The tibia , or shinbone , is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee .	1	biology
 The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end , with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end .	0	biology
 1600 . The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .	0	biology
 The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot .	1	biology
 The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes .	1	biology
 1603 . There are three types of fibrous joints : sutures , syndesmoses , and gomphoses .	0	biology
 Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1606 . Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage .	1	biology
 There are two types of cartilaginous joints : synchondroses and symphyses .	0	biology
 1609 . Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones ( [ link ] ) . This space is referred to as the synovial ( or joint ) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid .	1	biology
 1612 . Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .	1	biology
 Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .	1	biology
 1615 . There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .	0	biology
 Flexion , or bending , occurs when the angle between the bones decreases .	1	biology
 Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion .	0	biology
 1618 . Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side .	0	biology
 1621 . Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis .	1	biology
 Rotation can be toward the midline of the body , which is referred to as medial rotation , or away from the midline of the body , which is referred to as lateral rotation .	0	biology
 1624 . Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward , toward the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Eversion is the opposite of inversion , movement of the sole of the foot outward , away from the midline of the body .	1	biology
 Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane .	1	biology
 1627 . Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards .	0	biology
 Elevation is the movement of a bone upward , such as when the shoulders are shrugged , lifting the scapulae .	1	biology
 Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .	1	biology
 1630 . Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .	1	biology
 Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 1633 . Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	0	biology
 Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .	1	biology
 1636 . Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone .	1	biology
 This structure allows rotational movement , as the rounded bone moves around its own axis .	0	biology
 1639 . Ball - and - Socket JointsBall - and - socket joints possess a rounded , ball - like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone .	1	biology
 This organization allows the greatest range of motion , as all movement types are possible in all directions .	0	biology
 1642 . Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines , stomach , and urinary bladder , and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels .	0	biology
 Smooth muscle has no striations , is not under voluntary control , has only one nucleus per cell , is tapered at both ends , and is called involuntary muscle .	1	biology
 1645 . The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .	1	biology
 Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils — long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber .	1	biology
 Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber , and because they are only approximately 1.2 µm in diameter , hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber .	0	biology
 1648 . There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .	0	biology
 Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .	0	biology
 Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .	0	biology
 1651 . Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .	1	biology
 Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .	1	biology
 1654 . Bone , or osseous tissue , is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton .	1	biology
 It contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1657 . Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .	1	biology
 The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	1	biology
 The rounded ends , the epiphyses , are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1660 . Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required .	1	biology
 Examples of flat bones are the sternum ( breast bone ) , ribs , scapulae ( shoulder blades ) , and the roof of the skull ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1663 . Sutural bones are small , flat , irregularly shaped bones .	1	biology
 They may be found between the flat bones of the skull .	0	biology
 1666 . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .	0	biology
 Each osteon consists of lamellae , which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal .	1	biology
 The Haversian canal ( osteonic canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1669 . Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .	0	biology
 Instead , it consists of trabeculae , which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates .	1	biology
 Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae .	0	biology
 1672 . Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling , if the applied stresses have changed .	0	biology
 Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue ; these cells can not divide .	1	biology
 Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix .	0	biology
 1675 . Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes .	1	biology
 It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull , the mandible , and the clavicles .	0	biology
 1678 . Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones .	1	biology
 Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix , and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone .	1	biology
 1681 . From the nasal cavity , air passes through the pharynx ( throat ) and the larynx ( voice box ) , as it makes its way to the trachea ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body .	0	biology
 1684 . In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .	0	biology
 Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .	0	biology
 1687 . They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .	0	biology
 As the passageways decrease in diameter , the relative amount of smooth muscle increases . The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles .	0	biology
 The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts .	0	biology
 1690 . The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust , dirt , viral particles , and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses .	0	biology
 The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage .	0	biology
 1693 . At maximal capacity , an average lung can hold almost six liters of air , but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity .	0	biology
 Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Volume measures the amount of air for one function ( such as inhalation or exhalation ) .	1	biology
 1696 . It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .	0	biology
 Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .	1	biology
 The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .	1	biology
 1699 . It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 The inspiratory capacity ( IC ) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration .	1	biology
 It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 1702 . Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .	0	biology
 An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .	1	biology
 1705 . Gas Exchange across the AlveoliIn the body , oxygen is used by cells of the body ’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product .	0	biology
 The ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient ( RQ ) .	1	biology
 RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0 .	0	biology
 1708 . No muscles are contracting to expel the air . Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac .	0	biology
 The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura .	1	biology
 A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1711 . The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate .	1	biology
 On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .	0	biology
 1714 . This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid - air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together .	0	biology
 Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli .	1	biology
 By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid , it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse .	0	biology
 1717 . Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis .	0	biology
 In both diseases , the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic .	0	biology
 1720 . It is also independent of cardiac output .	0	biology
 This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment , which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases .	1	biology
 As cardiac output increases , the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused ( filled with blood ) increases .	1	biology
 1723 . Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place .	1	biology
 Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt , arises from an anatomical failure , while physiological dead space or physiological shunt , arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries .	1	biology
 1726 . The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood ( x - axis ) versus the relative Hb - oxygen saturation ( y - axis ) .	1	biology
 The resulting graph — an oxygen dissociation curve — is sigmoidal , or S - shaped ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 As the partial pressure of oxygen increases , the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen .	0	biology
 1729 . This is painful when it occurs .	0	biology
 Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb .	1	biology
 Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells , but these cells have lower - than - normal levels of hemoglobin .	0	biology
 1732 . In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .	0	biology
 Carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) .	0	biology
 Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions	1	biology
 1735 . As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .	0	biology
 In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .	1	biology
 As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .	0	biology
 1738 . The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .	1	biology
 The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .	1	biology
 This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .	0	biology
 1741 . As shown in [ link]b , amphibians have a three - chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two - chambered heart of fish .	0	biology
 The two atria ( superior heart chambers ) receive blood from the two different circuits ( the lungs and the systems ) , and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart ’s ventricle ( inferior heart chamber ) , which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation .	1	biology
 The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body .	0	biology
 1744 . Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones , and by removing waste .	0	biology
 Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease - fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection .	0	biology
 1747 . The atria are the chambers that receive blood , and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood .	1	biology
 The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava , which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms , as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs .	1	biology
 In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .	1	biology
 1750 . The left atrium then receives the oxygen - rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins .	0	biology
 This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve ( the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart ) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta , the major artery of the body , taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body .	1	biology
 Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta , the aortic semilunar valve ( or aortic valve ) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle .	0	biology
 1753 . The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .	1	biology
 1756 . The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .	0	biology
 Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques .	1	biology
 Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .	0	biology
 1759 . The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .	0	biology
 In each cardiac cycle , the heart contracts ( systole ) , pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body ; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( diastole ) , where the heart fills with blood , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The atria contract at the same time , forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles .	0	biology
 1762 . The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes .	0	biology
 This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram ( ECG)—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle .	1	biology
 1765 . Arterioles diverge into capillary beds .	0	biology
 Capillary beds contain a large number ( 10 to 100 ) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body .	0	biology
 Capillaries are narrow - diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients , waste , and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level .	1	biology
 1768 . In capillaries , this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells , as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis .	0	biology
 The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction , narrowing of the blood vessels , and vasodilation , widening of the blood vessels ; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure .	1	biology
 1771 . Throughout the cardiac cycle , the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate .	1	biology
 This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance .	0	biology
 1774 . Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .	1	biology
 Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 1777 . The body ’s fluids include blood plasma , the cytosol within cells , and interstitial fluid , the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body .	1	biology
 The membranes of the body ( such as the pleural , serous , and cell membranes ) are semi - permeable membranes .	0	biology
 Semi - permeable membranes are permeable ( or permissive ) to certain types of solutes and water .	1	biology
 1780 . The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .	1	biology
 The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .	1	biology
 If the solvent is water , one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water .	0	biology
 1783 . The kidneys , illustrated in [ link ] , are a pair of bean - shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity .	1	biology
 The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands .	0	biology
 1786 . The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .	1	biology
 The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	1	biology
 The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	1	biology
 1789 . The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .	1	biology
 The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .	1	biology
 The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	0	biology
 1792 . There are , on average , eight renal pyramids in each kidney .	0	biology
 The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .	1	biology
 The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 1795 . On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	1	biology
 The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 1798 . The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 1801 . Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex , giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally .	0	biology
 There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .	0	biology
 A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries .	0	biology
 1804 . The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function .	1	biology
 The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex .	0	biology
 The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	0	biology
 1807 . The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered .	0	biology
 The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole .	1	biology
 The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole .	1	biology
 1810 . In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .	1	biology
 In juxtamedullary nephrons , the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta .	0	biology
 1813 . Water is also reabsorbed during this step .	0	biology
 Then , additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion , which is , in essence , the opposite process to tubular reabsorption .	0	biology
 The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae .	0	biology
 6413 . Many newspapers now maintain both a print and an Internet presence in order to compete for readers .	0	government
 The rise of free news blogs , such as the Huffington Post , have made it difficult for newspapers to force readers to purchase online subscriptions to access material they place behind a digital paywall .	0	government

 6434 . In 1971 , the Supreme Court heard the Pentagon Papers case , in which the U.S. government sued the New York Times and the Washington Post to stop the release of information from a classified study of the Vietnam War .	1	government
 The Supreme Court ruled that while the government can impose prior restraint on the media , meaning the government can prevent the publication of information , that right is very limited .	0	government
 The court gave the newspapers the right to publish much of the study , but revelation of troop movements and the names of undercover operatives are some of the few approved reasons for which the government can stop publication or reporting .	0	government
 6437 . The Communications Act of 1934 replaced the Radio Act and created a more powerful entity to monitor the airwaves — a seven - member Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to oversee both radio and telephone communication .	1	government

 6467 . Why do we have two parties ?	0	government
 The two - party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections , with one seat tied to a geographic district , tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties .	0	government
 Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office .	0	government
 6470 . Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .	0	government
 In 1860 , four candidates competed for the presidency : Lincoln , a Republican ; two Democrats , one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party , a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery .	0	government
 6473 . Abandoning plurality voting , even if the winner - take - all election were kept , would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose .	0	government
 The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme , in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters .	1	government
 If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top contenders .	0	government
 6476 . Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the Electoral College , demobilized ethnicity , and campaign and election laws .	0	government
 First , the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College .	0	government
 6479 . One of the best - known party realignments occurred when Democrats moved to include African Americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the Great Depression .	0	government

 The party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates .	1	government
 It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “ brand . ” It also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office .	0	government
 6488 . First , many Americans , especially young people , are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level .	0	government

 6491 . One of the first challenges facing the party - in - government , or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals .	1	government
 The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties ; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses .	1	government
 6494 . Key benefits like committee appointments , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party .	0	government

 The Occupy Movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry .	0	government
 6503 . Several conflicting theories have been offered .	0	government
 The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position . Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 .	0	government
 According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns .	0	government
 Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics .	0	government
 6506 . Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	1	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government
 6509 . According to political scientist Nolan McCarty , there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone .	0	government
 First , he argues , the Senate has become polarized just as the House of Representatives has , but people vote for Senators on a statewide basis .	0	government
 6512 . In Federalist No .	0	government
 10 , written in the late eighteenth century , James Madison noted that the formation of self - interested groups , which he called factions , was inevitable in any society , as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government .	1	government
 Interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the United States .	0	government

 2016 . 6518 .	0	government
 However , members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views , but also in winning other elections .	0	government
 Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .	0	government
 The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .	0	government
 6521 . Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .	0	government
 However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .	0	government
 The Twelfth Amendment limited the House ’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes .	0	government
 6524 . New York : Oxford University Press , 330 - 34 .	0	government
 Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends .	0	government
 These men were the leaders of political machines , organizations that secured votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways .	1	government
 Perhaps more importantly , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed . Sean Wilentz .	0	government
 6527 . Roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the Progressive Party , as an alternative to the more business - minded Republicans .	0	government
 The Progressives sought to correct the many problems that had arisen as the United States transformed itself from a rural , agricultural nation into an increasingly urbanized , industrialized country dominated by big business interests .	1	government
 6530 . On April 15 ( or “ tax day ” ) , 2010 , members of the Tea Party movement rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in favor of smaller government and against the Affordable Care Act ( left ) .	0	government

 6533 . Formally , a lobbyist is someone who represents the interest organization before government , is usually compensated for doing so , and is required to register with the government in which he or she lobbies , whether state or federal .	1	government
 The lobbyist ’s primary goal is usually to influence policy .	0	government
 6536 . “ Interest Groups in the States . ” In Politics in the American States .	0	government
 Washington , DC : CQ Press , 105–131 .	0	government
 First , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues .	1	government
 Membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views .	0	government
 6539 . Interest groups also include associations , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade associations ) , and have similar concerns .	0	government
 The American Beverage Associationhttp://www.ameribev.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 includes Coca - Cola , Red Bull North America , ROCKSTAR , and Kraft Foods .	0	government
 6542 . While influencing policy is the primary goal , interest groups also monitor government activity , serve as a means of political participation for members , and provide information to the public and to lawmakers .	0	government
 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , by November 2015 , thirty - six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls.http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx ( November 78 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights .	0	government
 This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) .	0	government
 6545 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .	0	government
 Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .	1	government
 These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement .	0	government
 6548 . Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems .	0	government
 For instance , political scientist Robert Salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals . Robert Salisbury , “ An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups , ” Midwest Journal of Political Science 13 ( 1969 ) : 1–32 ; Peter B. Clark and James Q. Wilson , “ Incentive Systems : A Theory of Organizations , ” Administration Science Quarterly 6 ( 1961 ) : 129–166 .	0	government
 Some offer material incentives , which are tangible benefits of joining a group .	1	government
 AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .	0	government
 1951 . 6554 .	0	government
 Rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances .	0	government
 When , during his presidential candidacy , Donald Trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many rallied both for and against him . Jenna Johnson , “ Immigration continues to be Donald Trump ’s rallying issue , ” Washington Post , 22 October 2015 , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/immigration-continues-to-be-donald-trumps-rallying-issue/.Protestors take to the streets on different sides of the immigration issue .	0	government
 Some argue that the United States is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration .	0	government
 6557 . Joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community .	0	government
 Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level .	1	government
 Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .	0	government
 6560 . On the other hand , stem cell research is highly salient to members of the American Neurological Association , an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists .	0	government
 Accordingly , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community , but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs .	0	government
 Such was also the case when several unions split from the AFL - CIO ( American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , the nation ’s largest federation of unions , in 2005.Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Interest Groups in the States , ” 1991 , 1996 , 1999 , 2004 ; Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Nationalization of Interest Groups and Lobbying in the States . ” Improved technology and the development of social media have made it easier for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members .	0	government
 6563 . However , not all scholars accept the premise that mobilization is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision - makers .	0	government
 The elite critique suggests that certain interests , typically businesses and the wealthy , are advantaged and that policies more often reflect their wishes than anyone else ’s .	1	government

 In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court upheld Congress ’s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates .	1	government
 However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .	0	government
 In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .	1	government
 6572 . Some continued to argue that campaign expenditures are a form of speech , a position with which two recent Supreme Court decisions are consistent .	0	government
 The Citizens United v. Federal Election CommissionCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 08 - 205 , 558 U.S. 310 ( 2010 ) .	0	government
 and the McCutcheon v. Federal Election CommissionMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , 12 - 536 , 572 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2014 ) .	0	government
 cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections .	0	government
 Citizens United overturned the soft money ban of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections .	1	government
 6575 . While the Supreme Court has paved the way for increased spending in politics , lobbying is still regulated in many ways . Adam J. Newmark , “ Measuring State Legislative Lobbying Regulation , 1990–2003 . ” State Politics and Policy Quarterly 5 ( 2005 ) : 182–191 ; Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ” The 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act defined who can and can not lobby , and requires lobbyists and interest groups to register with the federal government . Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .	0	government
 The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 further increased restrictions on lobbying .	0	government
 For example , the act prohibited contact between members of Congress and lobbyists who were the spouses of other Congress members .	0	government
 6578 . States deep in debt were printing increasingly worthless paper currency , many were mired in interstate trade battles with each other , and in western Massachusetts , a small group of Revolutionary War veterans angry over the prospect of losing their farms broke into armed open revolt against the state , in what came to be known as Shays’ Rebellion .	1	government
 The conclusion many reached was that the Articles of Confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together .	0	government
 In the spring of 1787 , a convention was called , and delegates from all the states ( except Rhode Island , which boycotted the convention ) were sent to Philadelphia to hammer out a solution to this central problem .	0	government
 6581 . The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .	0	government
 The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .	1	government
 The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .	0	government
 6584 . Congressional apportionment today is achieved through the equal proportions method , which uses a mathematical formula to allocate seats based on U.S. Census Bureau population data , gathered every ten years as required by the Constitution .	1	government
 At the close of the first U.S. Congress in 1791 , there were sixty - five representatives , each representing approximately thirty thousand citizens .	0	government
 6587 . While the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals , nearly quintupling the number of African American representatives in Congress in just over two decades , they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice , gerrymandering .	0	government
 Gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate .	1	government
 6590 . An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .	1	government
 In this section , we will learn about each type of power and the foundations of legitimacy they claim .	0	government
 6593 . But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .	0	government
 Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .	0	government
 When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .	0	government
 6596 . But presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the expense of the Congress .	0	government
 By the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and Congress least powerful .	0	government
 For example , President Abraham Lincoln , who oversaw the prosecution of the Civil War , stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states.“Abraham Lincoln : Impact and Legacy , ” http://millercenter.org­/president/biography/lincoln-impact-and-legacy ( May 24 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 6599 . Following the twin scandals of Vietnam and Watergate in the early 1970s , Congress attempted to assert itself as a coequal branch , even in creating foreign policy , but could not hold back the trend .	0	government
 The War Powers Resolution ( covered in the foreign policy chapter ) was intended to strengthen congressional war powers but ended up clarifying presidential authority in the first sixty days of a military conflict .	0	government
 The war on terrorism after 9/11 has also strengthened the president ’s hand .	0	government
 6602 . Another important reform occurred in 2002 , when Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russell Feingold ( D - WI ) drafted , and Congress passed , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain - Feingold Act .	0	government
 The purpose of this law was to limit the use of “ soft money , ” which is raised for purposes like party - building efforts , get - out - the - vote efforts , and issue - advocacy ads .	1	government
 6605 . In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .	0	government
 A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .	1	government
 Such PACs tended to be run by businesses and other groups , like the Teamsters Union and the National Rifle Association , to support their special interests .	0	government
 6608 . Despite the power of the conferences , however , the most important leadership position in the House is actually elected by the entire body of representatives .	0	government
 This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .	0	government
 The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty - four Speakers have been .	0	government
 6611 . However , the majority rules the day in the House , like a cartel .	0	government
 On the majority side , because it holds the speakership , the majority leader also has considerable power .	0	government
 Historically , moreover , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current Speaker steps down .	0	government
 6614 . There are well over two hundred committees , subcommittees , select committees , and joint committees in the Congress .	0	government
 The core committees are called standing committees .	1	government
 There are twenty standing committees in the House and sixteen in the Senate ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6617 . In 2016 , Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa ( a ) , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , despite the urging of his committee colleagues .	0	government
 In the meantime , Garland met with numerous senators , such as Republican Susan Collins of Maine ( b ) .	0	government
 6620 . Once hearings have been completed , the bill enters the markup stage .	0	government
 This is essentially an amending and voting process .	1	government
 6623 . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .	0	government
 This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .	0	government
 Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .	0	government
 6626 . In a defining moment for the filibuster , Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for twenty - four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in 1957 .	0	government
 A vocal proponent of segregation and white supremacy , Thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform .	0	government
 6629 . Some interests groups form political action committees ( PACs ) , groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues .	1	government
 As [ link ] makes apparent , many large corporations like Honeywell International , AT&T , and Lockheed Martin form PACs to distribute money to candidates.https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Other PACs are either politically or ideologically oriented .	0	government
 6632 . For example , a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti - tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation .	0	government
 Prior to the election in 2012 , political activist Grover Norquist , the founder of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , asked all Republican members of Congress to sign a “ Taxpayer Protection Pledge ” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts .	0	government
 Ninety - five percent of the Republicans in Congress signed the pledge . Sean Lengell , “ Boehner : Grover Norquist Just a ‘ Random’ Guy , ” Washington Times , 3 November 2011 , http://www.washingtontimes.com / blog / inside - politics/2011/nov/3/boehner - grover - norquist - just - random - guy/ .	0	government
 Some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives .	0	government
 6635 . They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress .	0	government
 This is the delegate model of representation .	0	government
 6638 . Instead , proper representation for some is rooted in the racial , ethnic , socioeconomic , gender , and sexual identity of the representatives themselves .	1	government
 This form of representation is called descriptive representation .	0	government
 6641 . The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .	1	government
 For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .	0	government
 Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth , when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska .	0	government
 6644 . And as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with addressing those constituents’ interests .	0	government
 Historically , this job has included what some have affectionately called “ bringing home the bacon ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call pork - barrel politics .	0	government
 As a term and a practice , pork - barrel politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward .	1	government
 6647 . Indeed , when the ratings are graphed , the two noticeable peaks are at 57 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2001 ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 In 1998 , according to Gallup polling , the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures , including President Bill Clinton ’s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy .	0	government
" In 2001 , approval spiked after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Bush administration launched the "" War on Terror , "" sending troops first to Afghanistan and later to Iraq ."	0	government
 6650 . The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .	0	government
 The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .	0	government
 He proposed that Congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely undefined .	0	government
 6653 . By early September , the Electoral College had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection .	0	government
 This process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections .	0	government
 6656 . This should have meant that Texas ’s 32 electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other .	0	government
 Cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in Wyoming , where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier . Alan Clendenning , “ Court : Cheney Is Wyoming Resident , ” ABC News , 7 December 2000 , http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122289&page=1 ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 It ’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was , but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution , that was a real possibility .	0	government
 6659 . An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive — impeachment .	0	government
 Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing ; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors .	1	government
 6662 . The most recent impeachment was of President Bill Clinton , brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .	0	government
 House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton ’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment .	0	government
 6665 . Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers .	0	government
 Some waged undeclared wars , as John Adams did against the French in the Quasi - War ( 1798–1800 ) .	0	government
 Others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains , as Thomas Jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of Louisiana from France .	0	government
 6668 . James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	1	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States .	0	government
 6671 . He then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending U.S. troops to the Rio Grande , the border Texan expansionists claimed for Texas .	0	government
 Mexico sent troops in response , and the Mexican - American War began soon afterward . Fred Greenstein .	0	government

 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government
 He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .	0	government
 His successor , Andrew Johnson , became so embroiled with Radical Republicans about ways to implement Reconstruction policies and programs after the Civil War that the House of Representatives impeached him , although the legislators in the Senate were unable to successfully remove him from office .

 As the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .	0	government
 Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege , the right to withhold information from Congress , the judiciary , or the public .	1	government
 This right , not enumerated in the Constitution , was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch . Mark J. Rozel .	0	government
 6680 . Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized , amended , and approved by Congress .	0	government
 However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .	0	government
 His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .	0	government
 6683 . Following the first election of Washington , the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process , creating separate nomination and general election stages .	0	government
 Early on , the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus .	0	government
 The caucus or large - scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties .	1	government
 6686 . The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars’ control of the process of candidate selection .	0	government
 Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote .	0	government
 6689 . When Washington declined to run again after two terms , matters worsened .	0	government
 In 1796 , political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively .	0	government
 Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams ’s administration , much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello .	0	government
 6692 . Following the 2000 presidential election , when then - governor George W. Bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger , astonished voters called for Electoral College reform .	0	government
 Years later , however , nothing of any significance had been done .	0	government
 1989 . 6698 .	0	government
 The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .	0	government
 Instead , however , Senator Ted Cruz used the confirmation hearing to question the Vietnam War hero ’s patriotism .	0	government
 Hagel was eventually confirmed by a 58–41 vote .	0	government
 6701 . When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .	0	government
 Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .	0	government
 6704 . But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that ’s inclined to obstruct .	0	government
 Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments , respectively .	0	government
 President Obama has made far fewer recess appointments ; as of May 1 , 2015 , he had made only thirty - two . Bruce Drake , “ Obama lags his predecessors in recess appointments , ” 13 January 2014 , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/obama-lags-his-predecessors-in-recess-appointments/ ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , the pro forma session .	0	government
 6707 . Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration , often with a sharp edge .	0	government
 Richard Nixon ’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example .	0	government
 But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .	0	government
 6710 . In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .	0	government
 Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .	0	government
 President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure .	0	government
 7023 . The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years .	0	government
 The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II .	0	government
 The president negotiates a treaty , the Senate consents to the treaty by a two - thirds vote , and finally the president ratifies it .	0	government
 7026 . On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .	0	government
 In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law . United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .	0	government
 Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .	0	government
 Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement .	0	government
 7029 . Madeleine Albright ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was nominated by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the Senate 99–0 .	0	government
 Colin Powell ( b ) , nominated by George W. Bush , was also unanimously confirmed .	0	government
 7032 . These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president , including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis , executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises .	1	government
 These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “ energy and dispatch ” that Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency .	0	government
 Emergency spending does involve Congress through its power of the purse , but Congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies .	0	government
 7038 . Probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the Eisenhower presidency .	0	government
 When President Dwight D. Eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the Senate as treaties , Congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment ( the Bricker Amendment ) that would have altered the treaty process as we know it .	0	government
 Eisenhower understood the message and began to send more agreements through the process as treaties . Krutz and Peake .	0	government
 7044 . First , congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties speak on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues , including foreign policy .	0	government
 Some House and Senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees , such as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and the two defense committees ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 These members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy .	0	government
 7047 . The national security advisor heads the president ’s National Security Council , a group of senior - level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy advisor . Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .	1	government
 Even more important on intelligence than the CIA director is the director of national intelligence , a position created in the government reorganizations after 9/11 , who oversees the entire intelligence community in the U.S. government .	0	government
 7056 . The end of the Cold War opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller European countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared .	0	government
 Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement , including a vocal senator , Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , who was against the United States continuing to be the military “ policeman ” of the world .	0	government
 Helms was famous for opposing nearly all treaties brought to the Senate during his tenure .	0	government
 7059 . There is an element of idealism in liberal internationalism , because the United States assumes other countries will also put their best foot forward .	0	government
 A classic example of a liberal internationalist is President Woodrow Wilson , who sought a League of Nations to voluntarily save the world after World War I .	0	government
 7062 . Neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes , the United States should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world .	0	government
 The aggressive use ( or threat ) of hard power is the core value of neoconservatism .	1	government
 Acting unilaterally is acceptable in this view , as is adopting a preemptive strategy in which the United States intervenes militarily before the enemy can make its move .	0	government
 7071 . In 1946 , Mexican American parents in California , with the assistance of the NAACP , sued several California school districts that forced Mexican and Mexican American children to attend segregated schools .	0	government

 7080 . In 1913 , California passed a law preventing all Asians , not just the Chinese , from owning land .	0	government
 With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 , all Asians , with the exception of Filipinos , were prevented from immigrating to the United States or becoming naturalized citizens .	1	government
 Laws in several states barred marriage between Chinese and white Americans , and some cities with large Asian populations required Asian children to attend segregated schools . See Gabriel Chin and Hrishi Kathrikeyan .	0	government
 7083 . Ironically , violence directed indiscriminately against Chinese , Japanese , Koreans , and Vietnamese caused members of these groups to unite around a shared pan - Asian identity , much as Native Americans had in the Pan - Indian movement .	0	government
 In 1968 , students of Asian ancestry at the University of California at Berkeley formed the Asian American Political Alliance .	0	government
 Asian American students also joined Chicano , Native American , and African American students to demand that colleges offer ethnic studies courses . See William Wei .	0	government
 7089 . In 1973 , the American Psychological Association ended its classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder .	0	government
 In 1994 , the U.S. military adopted the policy of “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ” This act , Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 , officially prohibited discrimination against suspected gays , lesbians , and bisexuals by the U.S. military .	1	government
 It also prohibited superior officers from asking about or investigating the sexual orientation of those below them in rank . Public Law 103–160 : National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 .	0	government
 However , those gays , lesbians , and bisexuals who spoke openly about their sexual orientation were still subject to dismissal because it remained illegal for anyone except heterosexuals to serve in the armed forces .	0	government
 7092 . The legalization of same - sex marriage throughout the United States led some people to feel their religious beliefs were under attack , and many religiously conservative business owners have refused to acknowledge LBGT rights or the legitimacy of same - sex marriages .	0	government
 Following swiftly upon the heels of the Obergefell ruling , the Indiana legislature passed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) .	0	government
 Congress had already passed such a law in 1993 ; it was intended to extend protection to minority religions , such as by allowing rituals of the Native American Church .	1	government

 3918 . You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36 , 6 x 7 = 42 , and 6 x 8 = 48 .	0	psychology
 Memorizing these facts is rehearsal . Another strategy is chunking : you organize information into manageable bits or chunks ( Bodie , Powers , & Fitch - Hauser , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers .	0	psychology
 3921 . Use elaborative rehearsal : In a famous article , Craik and Lockhart ( 1972 ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory .	1	psychology
 Their theory is called levels of processing .	0	psychology
 If we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful .	0	psychology
 3924 . Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .	1	psychology
 Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .	1	psychology
 We refer to these domains throughout the chapter .	0	psychology
 3927 . Not all normative events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures .	0	psychology
 Biological milestones , such as puberty , tend to be universal , but social milestones , such as the age when children begin formal schooling , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 For example , in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old , but in developing countries , like Nigeria , children often enter school at an advanced age , if at all ( Huebler , 2005 ; United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization [ UNESCO ] , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3930 . How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?Are we who we are because of nature ( biology and genetics ) , or are we who we are because of nurture ( our environment and culture ) ? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate .	1	psychology
 3933 . Humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another .	0	psychology
 A poignant example is that of Trayvon Martin , a 17-year - old African American who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer , George Zimmerman , in a predominantly White neighborhood in 2012 .	0	psychology
 Zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin .	0	psychology
 3936 . Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .	0	psychology
 Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .	0	psychology
 3939 . Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world .	0	psychology
 Schemata are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information .	1	psychology
 By the time children have reached adulthood , they have created schemata for almost everything .	0	psychology
 3942 . The first stage is the sensorimotor stage , which lasts from birth to about 2 years old .	1	psychology
 During this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior .	0	psychology
 3945 . Kenny ’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces , so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did .	0	psychology
 Children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added .	1	psychology
 3948 . Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition .	1	psychology
 Take , for example , water that you poured into the short , fat glass : You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a couple of drops ) .	0	psychology
 3951 . After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas , Kohlberg reviewed people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 According to Kohlberg , an individual progresses from the capacity for pre - conventional morality ( before age 9 ) to the capacity for conventional morality ( early adolescence ) , and toward attaining post - conventional morality ( once formal operational thought is attained ) , which only a few fully achieve .	0	psychology
 3954 . Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .	1	psychology
 Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .	1	psychology
 3957 . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .	1	psychology
 An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .	1	psychology
 Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective .	0	psychology
 3960 . Therefore , a person ’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001).People from collectivistic cultures , such as some Asian cultures , are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual .	1	psychology
 Activities such as ( a ) preparing a meal , ( b ) hanging out , and ( c ) playing a game engage people in a group .	0	psychology
 3963 . We can understand self - serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution , a belief about the cause of a result .	1	psychology
 One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions : locus of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus unstable ) , and controllability ( controllable versus uncontrollable ) .	0	psychology
 3966 . A mother and father ’s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of conception .	0	psychology
 Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .	0	psychology
 3969 . After the zygote divides for about 7–10 days and has 150 cells , it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus .	1	psychology
 Upon implantation , this multi - cellular organism is called an embryo .	0	psychology
 Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .	0	psychology
 3972 . A teratogen is any environmental agent — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus .	1	psychology
 There are different types of teratogens .	0	psychology
 3975 . Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .	1	psychology
 Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .	1	psychology
 3978 . In social and emotional development , forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy .	0	psychology
 Attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others .	1	psychology
 Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone .	0	psychology
 3981 . With avoidant attachment , the child is unresponsive to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves .	1	psychology
 The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger .	0	psychology
 3984 . Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles : authoritative , authoritarian , permissive , and uninvolved .	0	psychology
 With the authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits , expresses warmth and affection , and listens to the child ’s point of view .	1	psychology
 Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them .	0	psychology
 3987 . With the uninvolved style of parenting , the parents are indifferent , uninvolved , and sometimes referred to as neglectful .	1	psychology
 They do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands .	0	psychology
 3990 . While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable , the onset and pace of puberty vary widely .	0	psychology
 Several physical changes occur during puberty , such as adrenarche and gonadarche , the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively .	0	psychology
 Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .	0	psychology
 3993 . Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .	1	psychology
 Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .	1	psychology
 3996 . Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support .	0	psychology
 As we get older , socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( Carstensen , 1992 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3999 . This shared knowledge comes from social norms .	0	psychology
 A social norm is a group ’s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 How are we expected to act ?	0	psychology
 4002 . ZIMBARDO ’S STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENTThe famous Stanford prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues at Stanford University , demonstrated the power of social roles , social norms , and scripts .	0	psychology
 In the summer of 1971 , an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life .	0	psychology
 4005 . Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .	0	psychology
 Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .	1	psychology
 We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies .	0	psychology
 4008 . The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like the group more , due to the justification of effort .	0	psychology
 We do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave .	0	psychology
 4011 . The topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology ( Fiske et al . , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 During the Second World War , Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army .	0	psychology
 After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .	0	psychology
 4014 . The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument ’s worthiness .	0	psychology
 For example , a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car ’s safety features and fuel economy .	0	psychology
 4017 . Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people .	0	psychology
 In one study , a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4020 . The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment . What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure ?	1	psychology
 Research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another dissenter , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity .	0	psychology
 4023 . In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .	1	psychology
 However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .	1	psychology
 What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?	0	psychology
 4026 . Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience .	0	psychology
 When certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks ( Milgram , 1965 ) .	0	psychology
 4029 . Sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance .	0	psychology
 Social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone .	1	psychology
 This typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled .	0	psychology
 4032 . The field of I - O psychology can be divided into three broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors .	0	psychology
 Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements .	1	psychology
 In addition , once employees are hired , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train , evaluate , and respond to those evaluations .	0	psychology
 4035 . Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising , management , and personnel selection .	0	psychology
 In 1903 , Scott published two books : The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising .	0	psychology
 4038 . Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing .	0	psychology
 Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers .	0	psychology
 In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled , The Principles of Scientific Management ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4041 . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different .	0	psychology
 Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group .	0	psychology
 4044 . Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos , Native Americans , European Americans ) .	1	psychology
 What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups ?	0	psychology
 4047 . Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .	1	psychology
 Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4050 . When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .	0	psychology
 A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .	1	psychology
 4053 . These groups serve as our in - groups .	0	psychology
 An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .	1	psychology
 A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .	1	psychology
 4056 . This often happens by blaming an out - group for the problem .	0	psychology
 Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out - group when the in - group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .	1	psychology
 4059 . Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .	1	psychology
 In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .	1	psychology
 4062 . Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying ( APA , 2010 ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied ( Olweus , 1993 ) :	0	psychology
 4065 . Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .	0	psychology
 The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .	1	psychology
 Instead , they just watch what is happening .	0	psychology
 4068 . Research suggests there are many other reasons .	0	psychology
 Altruism is people ’s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .	1	psychology
 In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4071 . Once we form relationships with people , we desire reciprocity .	0	psychology
 Reciprocity is the give and take in relationships .	1	psychology
 We contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well .	0	psychology
 4074 . Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages .	0	psychology
 4077 . One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory .	0	psychology
 According to social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( Rusbult & Van Lange , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 4080 . You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview .	0	psychology
 As you can imagine , most research is concerned with the employer ’s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too .	0	psychology
 4083 . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin : An employer can not discriminate based on skin color , hair texture , or other immutable characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in hiring , benefits , promotions , or termination of employees .	1	psychology
 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights Act ; it prohibits job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and termination ) discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required .	1	psychology
 4086 . Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology .	0	psychology
 In organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization .	1	psychology
 In this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different styles of management , different styles of leadership , organizational culture , and teamwork .	0	psychology
 4089 . Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business ’s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees .	1	psychology
 Industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those staying ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation packages ) , and how retained employees are supported .	0	psychology
 4092 . A significant portion of I - O research focuses on management and human relations .	0	psychology
 Douglas McGregor ( 1960 ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior .	1	psychology
 His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .	0	psychology
 4095 . Bass ( 1985 ) popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles .	0	psychology
 In transactional leadership , the focus is on supervision and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments ( i.e. , transactions ) .	1	psychology
 Transactional leaders maintain the status quo : They are managers .	1	psychology
 4098 . Each company and organization has an organizational culture .	0	psychology
 Organizational culture encompasses the values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its employees .	1	psychology
 It is how an organization is run , how it operates , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence .	0	psychology
 4101 . The U.S .	0	psychology
 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( n.d . ) provides the following description of sexual harassment :	0	psychology
 4104 . Whereas the two other areas of I - O psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work station , information displays , and the local environment , such as lighting .	1	psychology
 In the United States , human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering ; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth ( psychologist and engineer ) and her husband Frank Gilbreth ( engineer ) .	0	psychology
 4107 . These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .	0	psychology
 For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .	1	psychology
 Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .	0	psychology
 4110 . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .	0	psychology
 A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail .	1	psychology
 A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .	0	psychology
 4113 . A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .	0	psychology
 But when stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating , or what Selye termed distress ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .	1	psychology
 People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .	0	psychology
 4116 . Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .	0	psychology
 Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4119 . The general adaptation syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of three stages : ( 1 ) alarm reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of exhaustion ( Selye , 1936 ; 1976 ) .	0	psychology
 Alarm reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon .	1	psychology
 During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .	0	psychology
 4122 . What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?	0	psychology
 The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis .	0	psychology
 When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .	0	psychology
 4125 . The sociocultural perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background .	1	psychology
 For example , José is an 18-year - old Hispanic male from a traditional family .	0	psychology
 4128 . In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .	0	psychology
 They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .	0	psychology
 4131 . Potential stressors do not always involve major life events .	0	psychology
 Daily hassles — the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , rush hour traffic , lost keys , obnoxious coworkers , inclement weather , arguments with friends or family)—can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( Kanner , Coyne , Schaefer , & Lazarus , 1981 ) .	0	psychology
 4134 . This helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high .	0	psychology
 About 40%–60 % of individuals relapse , which means they return to abusing drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement ( National Institute on Drug Abuse [ NIDA ] , 2008 ) .	1	psychology
 4137 . In this section , we will discuss stress and illness .	0	psychology
 As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky ( 1998 ) describes ,	0	psychology
 4140 . In addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job .	0	psychology
 This situation is referred to as immunosuppression , the decreased effectiveness of the immune system .	1	psychology
 When people experience immunosuppression , they become susceptible to any number of infections , illness , and diseases .	0	psychology
 4143 . Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division , which includes growth and proliferation of new cells , thereby leading to more rapid aging ( Sapolsky , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 In the study , researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children ( Epel et al . , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children .	0	psychology
 4146 . These individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush .	1	psychology
 According to Friedman and Rosenman , these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern ; those who are more relaxed and laid - back were characterized as Type B ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In a sample of Type As and Type Bs , Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs ( Friedman & Rosenman , 1959 ) .	0	psychology
 4149 . Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .	1	psychology
 A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic - depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .	0	psychology
 4152 . The therapist informs the client about confidentiality , fees , and what to expect in treatment .	0	psychology
 Confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so .	1	psychology
 During the intake , the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals .	0	psychology
 4155 . Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The couple may be dating , partnered , engaged , or married .	0	psychology
 4158 . In strategic family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time .	1	psychology
 Typically , the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member ’s problem ( Madanes , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 4161 . Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century , but it has since waned significantly in popularity .	0	psychology
 4164 . Freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — maybe positive feelings , maybe negative feelings .	0	psychology
 Freud called this transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the psychoanalyst .	1	psychology
 For example , Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst .	0	psychology
 4167 . In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .	1	psychology
 In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .	1	psychology
 4170 . Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .	0	psychology
 Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior .	1	psychology
 Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors , such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking .	0	psychology
 4173 . Sometimes , it ’s too impractical , expensive , or embarrassing to re - create anxiety- producing situations , so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears .	0	psychology
 Virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a trauma and stressor - related disorder ( Gerardi , Cukor , Difede , Rizzo , & Rothbaum , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 4176 . Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s .	0	psychology
 His initial focus was on depression and how a client ’s self - defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( Beck , Rush , Shaw , & Emery , 1979 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4179 . Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential .	1	psychology
 So it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self - aware and accepting of themselves .	0	psychology
 In contrast to psychoanalysis , humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts .	0	psychology
 4182 . In active listening , the therapist acknowledges , restates , and clarifies what the client expresses .	0	psychology
 Therapists also practice what Rogers called unconditional positive regard , which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are .	1	psychology
 Rogers ( 1951 ) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness , empathy , and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves , which results in personal growth .	0	psychology
 4185 . As we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is chronic — takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications .	0	psychology
 When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .	0	psychology
 4188 . These efforts may include avoiding , minimizing , or distancing oneself from the problem , or positive comparisons with others ( “ I ’m not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ Now that I ’ve been fired , I can sleep in for a few days ” ) .	0	psychology
 In some cases , emotion - focused coping strategies involve reappraisal , whereby the stressor is construed differently ( and somewhat self - deceptively ) without changing its objective level of threat ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks , “ This will give me a great chance to network with others , ” is using reappraisal .	0	psychology
 4191 . Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear .	0	psychology
 Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) .	0	psychology
 4194 . Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks , there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( Salmon , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 It is well - established that exercise , both of long ( aerobic ) and short ( anaerobic ) duration , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4197 . The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( Benson & Proctor , 1994 ) .	1	psychology
 Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s .	0	psychology
 Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals .	1	psychology
 4200 . Measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do .	0	psychology
 Studies show that average national happiness scores ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to six key variables : per capita gross domestic product ( GDP , which reflects a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life expectancy , freedom from perceived corruption in government and business , and generosity ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4203 . Qualities that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - lasting , or trait - like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 4206 . By the 18th century , people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders .	1	psychology
 Often these people were kept in windowless dungeons , beaten , chained to their beds , and had little to no contact with caregivers .	0	psychology
 4209 . This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States .	0	psychology
 It started the process of deinstitutionalization , the closing of large asylums , by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally .	1	psychology
 In 1955 , there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals ( Torrey , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 4212 . However , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are diagnosed early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school .	0	psychology
 These conditions are listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , academic , and intellectual functioning ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 In this section , we will discuss two such disorders : attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism .	0	psychology
 4215 . The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder ; individuals diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary , but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication , such as talking only about their special interests ( Wing , Gould , & Gillberg , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 However , because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger ’s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder , the DSM-5 does not include it , which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ Asperger ’s Syndrome Dropped , ” 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work independently as adults .	0	psychology
 3312 . This is precisely the situation that Charles Darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 In simple terms , the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce , while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off .	1	psychology
 3315 . During the egg 's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes .	0	psychology
 Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .	1	psychology
 DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs .	1	psychology
 3318 . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) .	1	psychology
 A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .	1	psychology
 Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 ( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .	1	psychology
 3327 . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene .	0	psychology
 Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .	1	psychology
 Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .	0	psychology
 3330 . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction .	0	psychology
 Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall .	1	psychology
 For example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation .	0	psychology
 3333 . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious .	0	psychology
 For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - twin siblings ) .	1	psychology
 But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’s life .	0	psychology
 3336 . In a study of people who were given up for adoption , adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study :	0	psychology
 3339 . Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .	1	psychology
 Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons .	0	psychology
 3342 . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .	1	psychology
 The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .	0	psychology
 3345 . These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .	0	psychology
 The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 3348 . Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .	0	psychology
 Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters .	1	psychology
 3351 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential .	1	psychology
 Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .	0	psychology
 3354 . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals .	1	psychology
 The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions .	0	psychology
 3357 . The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) .	0	psychology
 Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake .	0	psychology
 Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3360 . In this perspective , psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders .	0	psychology
 Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance .	1	psychology
 Acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory ; it can increase arousal and enhance cognition .	0	psychology
 3363 . The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions : the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , shown in [ link ] .	0	psychology
 The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord ; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body .	1	psychology
 3366 . It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress - related activities ; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine , day - to - day operations .	1	psychology
 The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .	0	psychology
 3369 . For example , think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people , or right before taking a big test .	0	psychology
 You are in no real physical danger in those situations , and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response .	0	psychology
 This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world ; in fact , we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee .	0	psychology
 3372 . These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .	0	psychology
 The most prominent sulcus , known as the longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres : the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere .	1	psychology
 3375 . Forebrain StructuresThe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain ( [ link ] ) , which is the largest part of the brain .	0	psychology
 The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex ( called subcortical structures ) : thalamus , hypothalamus , pituitary gland , and the limbic system ( collection of structures ) .	1	psychology
 3378 . Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage .	0	psychology
 On September 13 , 1848 , Gage ( age 25 ) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont .	0	psychology
 3381 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .	1	psychology
 It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .	1	psychology
 The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically , which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3384 . The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology
 Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .	1	psychology
 Whereas individuals with damage to Broca ’s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to Wernicke ’s area can produce sensible language , but they are unable to understand it ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3387 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .	0	psychology
 The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .	1	psychology
 All of our senses , with the exception of smell , are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3390 . The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .	1	psychology
 The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .	1	psychology
 3393 . Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 3396 . The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord .	1	psychology
 It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3399 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) receives messages from muscles , tendons , joints , and structures in our ear to control balance , coordination , movement , and motor skills .	1	psychology
 The cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories .	0	psychology
 3402 . A computerized tomography ( CT ) scan involves taking a number of x - rays of a particular section of a person ’s body or brain ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The x - rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates , allowing a computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned .	0	psychology
 3405 . Tissues of different densities give off different signals , which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor .	0	psychology
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) operates on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels .	1	psychology
 The fMRI provides more detailed images of the brain ’s structure , as well as better accuracy in time , than is possible in PET scans ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3408 . Major GlandsThe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it .	1	psychology
 The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .	0	psychology
 3411 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .	1	psychology
 The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .	1	psychology
 These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .	0	psychology
 3414 . For one , each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment .	0	psychology
 An informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment , including potential risks and implications of the research .	1	psychology
 It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time .	0	psychology
 3417 . A participant in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study receives an injection .	0	psychology

 3420 . Correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables ( such as ice cream consumption and crime ) , but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect .	1	psychology
 When two variables are correlated , it simply means that as one variable changes , so does the other .	1	psychology
 3423 . Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .	0	psychology
 A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions .	1	psychology
 If two variables are negatively correlated , a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa .	0	psychology
 3426 . Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer .	0	psychology
 It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer , but if we were limited to correlational research , we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption .	0	psychology
 3429 . As you ’ve learned , the only way to establish that there is a cause - and - effect relationship between two variables is to conduct a scientific experiment .	0	psychology
 Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life .	0	psychology
 3432 . We also need to precisely define , or operationalize , what is considered violent and nonviolent .	0	psychology
 An operational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables , and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment .	1	psychology
 In operationalizing violent behavior , we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior , or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges .	0	psychology
 3435 . In a double - blind study , both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments .	1	psychology
 Why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group ?	0	psychology
 3438 . In our example of how violent television programs affect children ’s display of violent behavior , the independent variable is the type of program — violent or nonviolent — viewed by participants in the study ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had .	1	psychology
 In our example , the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants .	0	psychology
 3441 . Now that we have a sample , the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment .	0	psychology
 With random assignment , all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group .	1	psychology
 There is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group .	0	psychology
 3444 . The American Psychological Association ( APA ) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for submission to scientific journals .	0	psychology
 Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology Today , which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology , scientific journals generally publish peer - reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves .	1	psychology
 3447 . This is where validity comes into play .	0	psychology
 Validity refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it ’s supposed to measure .	1	psychology
 While any valid measure is by necessity reliable , the reverse is not necessarily true .	0	psychology
 3450 . We want our researcher to be inconspicuous — perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information .	0	psychology
 This type of observational study is called naturalistic observation : observing behavior in its natural setting .	1	psychology
 To better understand peer exclusion , Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground .	0	psychology
 3453 . Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias .	0	psychology
 Generally , people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations .	1	psychology
 3456 . Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods .	0	psychology
 A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in .	1	psychology
 Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population .	0	psychology
 3459 . Another approach is cross - sectional research .	0	psychology
 In cross - sectional research , a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time .	1	psychology
 Using the dietary habits example above , the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age .	0	psychology
 3462 . One of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars .	0	psychology
 As the new governor , you need to decide whether to continue funding the D.A.R.E .	0	psychology
 ( Drug Abuse Resistance Education ) program in public schools ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 This program typically involves police officers coming into the classroom to educate students about the dangers of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs .	1	psychology
 3465 . The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive .	0	psychology
 In deductive reasoning , ideas are tested against the empirical world ; in inductive reasoning , empirical observations lead to new ideas ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 These processes are inseparable , like inhaling and exhaling , but different research approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects .	0	psychology
 3468 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .	0	psychology
 Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3471 . The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind .	1	psychology
 Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge .	0	psychology
 3474 . Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .	0	psychology
 A dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’s doctoral training .	1	psychology
 In the United States , a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3477 . Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in the preceding section .	0	psychology
 Reflective of the discipline ’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the United States .	1	psychology
 3480 . Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As such , sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary .	0	psychology
 3483 . Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood , providing enormous insight into the differences in physical , cognitive , and social capacities that exist between very young children and adults .	0	psychology
 For instance , research by Jean Piaget ( [ link ] ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence .	0	psychology
 Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are hidden from us .	1	psychology
 3486 . Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .	1	psychology
 These five dimensions are known as the “ Big Five ” or the Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness , and extraversion ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan ( e.g. , Rantanen , Metsäpelto , Feldt , Pulkinnen , and Kokko , 2007 ; Soldz & Vaillant , 1999 ; McCrae & Costa , 2008 ) and is influenced by genetics ( e.g. , Jang , Livesly , and Vernon , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 3489 . Industrial - Organizational psychology ( I - O psychology ) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological theories , principles , and research findings in industrial and organizational settings .	1	psychology
 I - O psychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management , organizational structure , and workplace environment .	0	psychology
 3492 . Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance , including motivation and performance anxiety , and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing .	1	psychology
 Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general .	0	psychology
 3495 . As mentioned earlier , both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still found among some of today ’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective , Roger ’s ideas about client - centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate .	0	psychology
 Furthermore , both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of behavioral therapy , cognitive therapy , and cognitive - behavioral therapy ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3498 . Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience .	0	psychology
 Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed .	1	psychology
 Wundt ’s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) .	0	psychology
 3501 . Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected .	1	psychology
 As James saw it , psychology ’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism .	0	psychology
 Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment .	1	psychology
 3504 . These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles .	0	psychology
 The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception .	1	psychology
 For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony .	0	psychology
 3507 . Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control .	1	psychology
 Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism .	0	psychology
 A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism .	0	psychology
 3510 . Thus , humanism emerged .	0	psychology
 Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans .	1	psychology
 Two of the most well - known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers ( O’Hara , n.d . ) .	0	psychology
 3513 . Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under - studied .	0	psychology
 There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) .	0	psychology
 3516 . Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .	1	psychology
 Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .	1	psychology
 In between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming , intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use , meditative states , hypnotic states , and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation .	0	psychology
 3519 . If we have biological rhythms , then is there some sort of biological clock ?	0	psychology
 In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .	1	psychology
 3522 . For example , most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day .	0	psychology
 One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .	0	psychology
 The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 3525 . When we do this , we often experience jet lag .	0	psychology
 Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .	1	psychology
 These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 3528 . When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day - to - day life , they accumulate a sleep debt .	0	psychology
 A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis .	0	psychology
 The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency .	0	psychology
 3531 . One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology .	0	psychology
 Evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection .	1	psychology
 Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring .	0	psychology
 3534 . The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep .	0	psychology
 Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep , the period during which we drift off to sleep .	1	psychology
 During this time , there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat .	0	psychology
 3537 . As we move into stage 2 sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation .	1	psychology
 Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3540 . Stage 3 and stage 4 of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow - wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency ( up to 4 Hz ) , high amplitude delta waves ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 During this time , an individual ’s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically .	0	psychology
 3543 . Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .	1	psychology
 Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .	1	psychology
 For instance , if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake , Freud might have argued that this represents the woman ’s fear of sexual intimacy , with the snake serving as a symbol of a man ’s penis .	0	psychology
 3546 . Some forms of psychotherapy , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy , can help sufferers of insomnia .	0	psychology
 Cognitive - behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors .	1	psychology
 The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia ( e.g. , spending more waking time in bed ) .	0	psychology
 3549 . REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase does not occur .	1	psychology
 Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep , especially during disturbing dreams .	0	psychology
 3552 . Sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper ’s breathing stops .	1	psychology
 These episodes can last 10–20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal .	0	psychology
 3555 . In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose .	0	psychology
 3558 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .	1	psychology
 These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .	1	psychology
 This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep ( Burgess & Scammell , 2012 ; Hishikawa & Shimizu , 1995 ; Luppi et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3561 . In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .	1	psychology
 In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .	1	psychology
 3564 . Ethanol , which we commonly refer to as alcohol , is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity .	1	psychology
 Other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines .	0	psychology
 3567 . The cocaine , amphetamine , cathinones , and MDMA users seek a euphoric high , feelings of intense elation and pleasure , especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking .	0	psychology
 Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences .	0	psychology
 3570 . An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and codeine .	1	psychology
 Opioids have analgesic properties ; that is , they decrease pain .	0	psychology
 3573 . Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .	1	psychology
 Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .	1	psychology
 Other drugs , including the opioid buprenorphine , have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal .	0	psychology
 3576 . Hypnosis is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli .	1	psychology
 In the therapeutic setting , a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient .	0	psychology
 3579 . These cells relay messages , in the form of action potentials ( as you learned when studying biopsychology ) , to the central nervous system .	0	psychology
 The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction .	1	psychology
 3582 . Sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them .	1	psychology
 This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold .	0	psychology
 Unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity .	0	psychology
 3585 . On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .	1	psychology
 This is called top - down processing .	0	psychology
 3588 . If so , then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise .	0	psychology
 The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory .	1	psychology
 This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep .	0	psychology
 3591 . Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .	1	psychology
 Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .	1	psychology
 3594 . The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays , x - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light , infrared light , microwaves , and radio waves .	0	psychology
 3597 . This is known as the timbre of a sound .	0	psychology
 Timbre refers to a sound ’s purity , and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency , amplitude , and timing of sound waves .	1	psychology
 3600 . It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .	0	psychology
 The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes , and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal .	1	psychology
 When light levels are low , the pupil will become dilated , or expanded , to allow more light to enter the eye .	0	psychology
 3603 . The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .	0	psychology
 In a normal - sighted individual , the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea , which is part of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye .	1	psychology
 The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3606 . While cones are concentrated in the fovea , where images tend to be focused , rods , another type of photoreceptor , are located throughout the remainder of the retina .	0	psychology
 Rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions , and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones , they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field .	1	psychology
 3609 . The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the optic chiasm is an X - shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain .	0	psychology
 3615 . We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth .	0	psychology
 Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .	1	psychology
 One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .	1	psychology
 3621 . The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .	0	psychology
 The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3624 . We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory .	0	psychology
 The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron .	1	psychology
 This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave .	0	psychology
 3627 . Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound .	1	psychology
 3630 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .	1	psychology
 Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .	1	psychology
 3633 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .	1	psychology
 One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 3636 . This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array .	1	psychology
 The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain .	0	psychology
 3639 . You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste : sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .	0	psychology
 Research demonstrates , however , that we have at least six taste groupings .	0	psychology
 Umami is our fifth taste .	0	psychology
 3642 . Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose .	1	psychology
 Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3645 . These receptors include Meissner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian corpuscles , Merkel ’s disks , and Ruffini corpuscles .	0	psychology
 Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .	1	psychology
 Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .	1	psychology
 3648 . Generally speaking , pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature .	0	psychology
 Pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain .	1	psychology
 In some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system .	0	psychology
 3651 . The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( utricle , saccule , and the three semicircular canals ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear .	0	psychology
 3654 . One Gestalt principle is the figure - ground relationship .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground .	1	psychology
 3657 . Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity ( or good continuation ) and closure .	0	psychology
 The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3660 . You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 Our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses : educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information .	1	psychology
 These hypotheses are informed by a number of factors , including our personalities , experiences , and expectations .	0	psychology
 3663 . Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with .	0	psychology
 Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment .	1	psychology
 They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .	0	psychology
 3666 . Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence .	0	psychology
 Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment .	1	psychology
 You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious .	0	psychology
 3669 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	1	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3672 . Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response .	1	psychology
 Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs .	0	psychology
 3675 . Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet .	0	psychology
 Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning .	1	psychology
 This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus : the squeaky cabinet ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3678 . Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone .	0	psychology
 Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response .	0	psychology
 3681 . On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination .	1	psychology
 The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response .	0	psychology
 3687 . His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .	1	psychology
 Essentially , if an organism does something that brings about a desired result , the organism is more likely to do it again .	0	psychology
 3690 . Remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .	1	psychology
 In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .	1	psychology
 3693 . ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments , Skinner often used an approach called shaping .	0	psychology
 Instead of rewarding only the target behavior , in shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior .	1	psychology
 Why is shaping needed ?	0	psychology
 3699 . With a variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are unpredictable .	1	psychology
 Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast - food restaurant .	0	psychology
 3702 . Although strict behaviorists such as Skinner and Watson refused to believe that cognition ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another behaviorist , Edward C. Tolman , had a different opinion .	0	psychology
 Tolman ’s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930 ; Tolman , Ritchie , & Kalish , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 3705 . Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning , which are forms of associative learning .	0	psychology
 In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 3708 . Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account .	0	psychology
 According to Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement .	0	psychology
 He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation .	0	psychology
 3711 . What are the implications of this study ?	0	psychology
 Bandura concluded that we watch and learn , and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects .	0	psychology
 Prosocial ( positive ) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior .	0	psychology
 3714 . The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts .	0	psychology
 Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .	1	psychology
 Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .	0	psychology
 3717 . An artificial concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics .	1	psychology
 Various properties of geometric shapes , like squares and triangles , serve as useful examples of artificial concepts .	0	psychology
 3723 . Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	1	psychology
 Grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon ( Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 For instance , English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “ -ed ” at the end to indicate past tense .	0	psychology
 3726 . Semantics and syntax are part of a language ’s grammar .	0	psychology
 Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3729 . B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds .	0	psychology
 3732 . Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 For example , a well - known strategy is trial and error .	0	psychology
 The old adage , “ If at first you do n’t succeed , try , try again ” describes trial and error .	0	psychology
 3738 . The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias .	0	psychology
 An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 3741 . Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .	1	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .	1	psychology
 3744 . Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .	1	psychology
 In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others .	1	psychology
 3747 . According to the drive theory of motivation , deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs .	1	psychology
 These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to homeostasis .	0	psychology
 3750 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .	1	psychology
 Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .	0	psychology
 3753 . In the 1940s , Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components : crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence ( Cattell , 1963 ) .	0	psychology
 Crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it .	1	psychology
 When you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using crystallized intelligence .	0	psychology
 3756 . Practical intelligence , as proposed by Sternberg , is sometimes compared to “ street smarts . ” Being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences .	1	psychology
 This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ ; individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence ( Sternberg , 1988 ) .	0	psychology
 3759 . Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner , a Harvard psychologist and former student of Erik Erikson .	0	psychology
 Gardner ’s theory , which has been refined for more than 30 years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence .	0	psychology
 3762 . Creativity is the ability to generate , create , or discover new ideas , solutions , and possibilities .	1	psychology
 Very creative people often have intense knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at novel solutions , seek out the advice and help of other experts , and take risks .	0	psychology
 3765 . For most people , once they have eaten , they feel satiation , or fullness and satisfaction , and their eating behavior stops .	0	psychology
 Like the initiation of eating , satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms .	0	psychology
 3768 . Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play .	0	psychology
 A person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time , and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates .	1	psychology
 People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism .	0	psychology
 3771 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .	1	psychology
 People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	1	psychology
 3774 . Prader - Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism .	1	psychology
 Typically , affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating .	0	psychology
 3777 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	0	psychology
 3780 . Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual ’s sexual orientation ( Jenkins , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and erotic attractions to same - sexed individuals ( homosexual ) , opposite - sexed individuals ( heterosexual ) , or both ( bisexual ) .	1	psychology
 3783 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	1	psychology
 3786 . In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation .	1	psychology
 While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 3789 . When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender dysphoria .	0	psychology
 Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are .	1	psychology
 This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria .	0	psychology
 3792 . As a result , the test was normed and standardized , which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) .	0	psychology
 Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 3795 . Without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population .	0	psychology
 A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population .	1	psychology
 If , for example , you measured the height of the women in your classroom only , you might not actually have a representative sample .	0	psychology
 3807 . The Schachter - Singer two - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience .	0	psychology
 According to this theory , emotions are composed of two factors : physiological and cognitive .	1	psychology
 3810 . THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONSEarlier , you learned about the limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The limbic system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , and the hippocampus .	0	psychology
 3813 . It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 The central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems’ activity ( Pessoa , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3816 . This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin ’s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .	0	psychology
 In fact , there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions .	0	psychology
 These include : happiness , surprise , sadness , fright , disgust , contempt , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( Ekman & Keltner , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 3819 . Personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think , feel , and behave in specific ways .	1	psychology
 Our personality is what makes us unique individuals .	0	psychology
 3822 . According to Freud , unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood sexuality , are the forces that influence our personality .	0	psychology
 Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality .	1	psychology
 These theorists , referred to as neo - Freudians , generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality .	0	psychology
 3825 . The unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges , and is present from birth .	1	psychology
 It directs impulses for hunger , thirst , and sex .	0	psychology
 3828 . According to Freud , a person who has a strong ego , which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego , has a healthy personality .	0	psychology
 Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or unhealthy behaviors .	1	psychology
 For example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive .	0	psychology
 3834 . In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .	1	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 3837 . After passing through the oral stage , children enter what Freud termed the anal stage ( 1–3 years ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training .	1	psychology
 3840 . The final stage is the genital stage ( from puberty on ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface .	1	psychology
 3843 . He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology
 An inferiority complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society .	1	psychology
 3846 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) . These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 3849 . Memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer .	0	psychology
 Memory is the set of processes used to encode , store , and retrieve information over different periods of time ( [ link]).Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Storage is the retention of the encoded information .	1	psychology
 3852 . It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information .	1	psychology
 This is known as effortful processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3855 . Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect .	0	psychology
 The self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance ( Rogers , Kuiper & Kirker , 1977 ) .	1	psychology
 Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter ?	0	psychology
 3858 . In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 Their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called Atkinson - Shiffrin ( A - S ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information .	1	psychology
 3861 . Short - term memory ( STM ) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory .	1	psychology
 Short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long - term memory .	0	psychology
 3864 . Understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types .	0	psychology
 Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall .	1	psychology
 For example , if you are studying for your chemistry exam , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory .	0	psychology
 3867 . Declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced .	1	psychology
 Explicit ( declarative ) memory has two parts : semantic memory and episodic memory .	0	psychology
 3870 . Can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — meals , conversations , clothing choices , weather conditions , and so on ?	0	psychology
 Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions ; however , American actress Marilu Henner , best known for the television show Taxi , can remember .	0	psychology
 She has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3873 . There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and relearning .	0	psychology
 Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval : it means you can access information without cues .	1	psychology
 For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 3876 . Karl Lashley began exploring this problem , about 100 years ago , by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys .	0	psychology
 He was searching for evidence of the engram : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( Josselyn , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 First , Lashley ( 1950 ) trained rats to find their way through a maze .	0	psychology
 3879 . Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats , and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks , such as object recognition and maze running .	0	psychology
 3882 . It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories , and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories ; this is called arousal theory ( Christianson , 1992 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which strengthen memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event .	0	psychology
 3885 . Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning .	0	psychology
 He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .	0	psychology
 3888 . Bandura ( 1977 , 1995 ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - efficacy .	0	psychology
 Self - efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities , developed through our social experiences .	1	psychology
 Self - efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals .	0	psychology
 3891 . Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford , where he was a colleague of Albert Bandura .	0	psychology
 Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior , and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology .	0	psychology
 3894 . Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma .	1	psychology
 People with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past .	0	psychology
 3897 . In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes , the Innocence Project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions ( Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Yeshiva University , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3900 . Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome .	1	psychology
 This syndrome has received a lot of publicity , particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses — often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) .	0	psychology
 3903 . I know I read the book in high school , and I remember that one of the main characters is named Scout , and her father is an attorney , but I honestly do n’t remember anything else . ” Nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is surprised she ca n’t recall the plot .	0	psychology
 What is going on here is storage decay : unused information tends to fade with the passage of time . In 1885 , German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization .	1	psychology
 First , he memorized lists of nonsense syllables .	0	psychology
 3906 . Memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final distortion error .	0	psychology
 Schacter ( 2001 ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events .	0	psychology
 3909 . These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .	0	psychology
 Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .	1	psychology
 For example , this week you are studying about Freud ’s Psychoanalytic Theory .	0	psychology
 3912 . Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers .	0	psychology
 One of Rogers ’s main ideas about personality regards self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves .	1	psychology
 How would you respond to the question , “ Who am I ? ” Your answer can show how you see yourself .	0	psychology
 4312 . Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .	1	economic
 These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .	0	economic
 4315 . Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .	0	economic
 In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .	1	economic
 4321 . How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?	0	economic
 Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank .	1	economic
 For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use .	0	economic
 A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other .	1	economic
 The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials .	0	economic
 4327 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .	1	economic
 4330 . Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure .	0	economic
 A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses .	1	economic
 The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .	0	economic
 4336 . Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .	1	economic
 Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .	1	economic
 The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .	1	economic
 4339 . Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired .	1	economic
 The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative .	0	economic
 4342 . People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide .	0	economic
 Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real .	0	economic
 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either .	0	economic
 This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) .	0	economic
 There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice .	0	economic
 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline .	1	economic
 When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .	0	economic
 4351 . Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires .	1	economic
 How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics .	0	economic
 4354 . Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists .	0	economic
 Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be .	0	economic
 For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city .	0	economic
 4357 . But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level .	0	economic
 The second theme is tradeoffs .	0	economic
 As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good .	0	economic
 4360 . Finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices .	0	economic
 An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today .	0	economic
 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .	1	economic
 The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .	1	economic
 4366 . An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .	1	economic
 Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	1	economic
 Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .	1	economic
 4369 . Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .	0	economic
 Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve .	0	economic
 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity .	1	economic
 While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves .	0	economic
 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices .	0	economic
 The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence .	1	economic
 Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good .	0	economic
 4378 . The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas .	0	economic
 The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good .	1	economic
 4381 . Let ’s define what is meant by the firm .	0	economic
 A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs .	1	economic
 If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .	0	economic
 4384 . We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit .	0	economic
 Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made .	1	economic
 Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .	0	economic
 4387 . It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .	0	economic
 Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs .	1	economic
 The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit .	0	economic
 4390 . Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term .	1	economic
 Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same .	0	economic
 4393 . Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output .	1	economic
 Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut .	0	economic
 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well .	1	economic
 This situation is called diseconomies of scale .	0	economic
 A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials .	0	economic
 4405 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .	1	economic
 The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 4411 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .	1	economic
 Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .	1	economic
 A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 4414 . Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph .	0	economic
 A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices .	1	economic
 Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .	0	economic
 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .	1	economic
 The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .	1	economic
 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price .	1	economic
 In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel .	0	economic
 4423 . The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .	1	economic
 Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal .	0	economic
 A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant .	0	economic
 4426 . The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising .	0	economic
 It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 .	0	economic
 4429 . These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .	0	economic
 Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .	0	economic
 The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens .	0	economic
 4432 . For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .	0	economic
 A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right . When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .	0	economic
 For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .	0	economic
 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) .	0	economic
 So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher .	0	economic
 Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 .	0	economic
 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be .	0	economic
 According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 .	0	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe .	0	economic
 In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 .	0	economic
 4441 . At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results .	0	economic
 In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have .	0	economic
 Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises .	0	economic
 4444 . In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .	0	economic
 Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage .	0	economic
 Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living .	0	economic
 4447 . The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets .	0	economic
 According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded .	1	economic
 As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow .	0	economic
 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .	0	economic
 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices .	0	economic
 In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate .	0	economic
 The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption .	1	economic
 This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utilitychange in quantityMU = change in total utilitychange in quantityNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility .	0	economic
 4459 . This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility .	0	economic
 Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie .	0	economic
 4462 . How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?	0	economic
 Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line .	0	economic
 But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?	0	economic
 4465 . This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously .	0	economic
 The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .	1	economic
 The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .	1	economic
 4468 . Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example .	0	economic
 The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint .	0	economic
 4471 . [ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint .	0	economic
 Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement .	0	economic
 4474 . And what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood .	0	economic
 So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics .	1	economic
 It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation .	0	economic
 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold .	1	economic
 This is referred to as the market structure of the industry .	0	economic
 In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition .	0	economic
 4480 . A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce .	0	economic
 To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :	0	economic
 4483 . In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced .	0	economic
 If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise .	0	economic
 4486 . No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price .	0	economic
 However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market .	0	economic
 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before .	1	economic
 Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor .	0	economic
 4492 . To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example .	0	economic
 Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC .	0	economic
 4495 . There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit .	0	economic
 One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .	1	economic
 The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .	1	economic
 4498 . Copyright Office .	0	economic
 A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years .	1	economic
 The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires .	0	economic
 4501 . But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply .	0	economic
 There is also a body of law known as trade secrets .	0	economic
 Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets .	0	economic
 4504 . Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market .	0	economic
 One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition .	1	economic
 Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove .	0	economic
 4507 . For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price .	0	economic
 But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue .	0	economic
 When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price .	0	economic
 4510 . A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition .	0	economic
 If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power .	1	economic
 They simply have to take the market price as given .	0	economic
 4513 . Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) .	0	economic
 Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive . The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly .	0	economic
 Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms .	1	economic
 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product .	0	economic
 Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers .	0	economic
 For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands .	0	economic
 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering .	0	economic
 First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces .	0	economic
 Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products .	0	economic
 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run .	0	economic
 Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit .	0	economic
 A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use .	1	economic
 4525 . Rather , they are oligopolies .	0	economic
 Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry .	1	economic
 Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel .	0	economic
 4528 . By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves .	0	economic
 When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .	1	economic
 A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .	1	economic
 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists .	0	economic
 Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”	0	economic
 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly .	1	economic
 If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits .	0	economic
 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases .	1	economic
 This situation is shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4540 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .	0	economic
 When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .	1	economic
 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm .	1	economic
 Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law .	0	economic
 In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .	0	economic
 4546 . Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry .	0	economic
 An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .	1	economic
 For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .	1	economic
 4549 . Defining a market is often controversial .	0	economic
 For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems .	0	economic
 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .	1	economic
 Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .	0	economic
 4555 . Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product .	1	economic
 Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need .	0	economic
 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s .	0	economic
 Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care .	0	economic
 4561 . The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest .	0	economic
 Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point .	0	economic
 This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A .	0	economic
 4564 . Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well .	0	economic
 The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates .	1	economic
 The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular — airlines . What are the results of airline deregulation ?	0	economic
 4567 . The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as Wachovia , and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) , which had to be nationalized — that is , taken over by the federal government .	1	economic
 One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd - Frank Act , which attempted major reforms of the financial system .	0	economic
 The legislation ’s purpose , as noted on dodd-frank.com is :	0	economic
 4570 . The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .	1	economic
 Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .	0	economic
 If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .	0	economic
 4573 . Pollution is a negative externality .	0	economic
 Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .	0	economic
 The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society .	1	economic
 4576 . However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .	0	economic
 Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .	0	economic
 When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) .	1	economic
 4579 . In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .	0	economic
 Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .	0	economic
 These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades .	0	economic
 4582 . When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g .	0	economic
 cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards .	0	economic
 4585 . However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs .	0	economic
 A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one .	0	economic
 The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion .	0	economic
 4588 . However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used .	0	economic
 The marginal cost curve rises .	0	economic
 Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits .	0	economic
 4591 . However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth .	0	economic
 After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today .	0	economic
 It is hard to tell people who are living in a low - income country , where adequate diet , health care , and education are lacking , that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment .	0	economic
 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .	1	economic
 However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .	0	economic
 4597 . In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea .	0	economic
 Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug .	0	economic
 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .	0	economic
 The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .	1	economic
 As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .	1	economic
 4603 . Data in [ link ] , from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers , Third Quarter 2014 , demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education .	0	economic
 While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts , the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker , so these returns are private rates of return to education .	0	economic
 The first row is a header row and it labels the last three columns , ' Less than a High School Degree , ' ' High School Degree , No College , ' and ' Bachelor 's Degree . '	0	economic
 4606 . One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process .	0	economic
 Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .	1	economic
 For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .	0	economic
 4609 . For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ” The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical - related research spending $ 117 billion in 2011 .	1	economic

 Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand .	1	biology
 Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .	1	biology
 1215 . Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers ; together , the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile .	1	biology
 Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .	0	biology
 1218 . The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .	1	biology
 Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .	1	biology
 Other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere , such as sand and glacial drift .	0	biology
 1221 . Topsoil is rich in organic material ; microbial processes occur there , and it is the “ workhorse ” of plant production .	1	biology
 The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering , and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil .	1	biology
 This horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter .	0	biology
 1224 . Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .	1	biology

 1236 . The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther .	0	biology
 In a plant ’s male reproductive organs , development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The microsporangia , which are usually bi - lobed , are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains .	1	biology

 In the female cone , megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium .	0	biology
 1248 . Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 Self - pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time , and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower ’s stigma .	0	biology
 1251 . Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 After fertilization is complete , no other sperm can enter .	0	biology
 1254 . The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots .	0	biology
 In monocots , such as corn and wheat , the single cotyledon is called a scutellum ; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue ( xylem and phloem ) .	1	biology
 Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .	0	biology
 1257 . Tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) , tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) , and pepper ( Capsicum annuum ) are examples of endospermic dicots .	0	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization , but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage .	0	biology
 The two halves of a peanut seed ( Arachis hypogaea ) and the split peas ( Pisum sativum ) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves .	0	biology
 1260 . The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 In dicots , the hypocotyls extend above ground , giving rise to the stem of the plant .	0	biology
 1266 . Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings .	0	biology
 Some seeds require vernalization ( cold treatment ) before they can germinate .	1	biology
 This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring .	0	biology
 1269 . If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .	1	biology
 1272 . Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .	1	biology
 Together , all three are known as the pericarp .	0	biology
 1275 . Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses , citrus species , and other plants .	0	biology
 In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .	0	biology
 The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .	1	biology
 1278 . Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil .	1	biology
 Young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred .	0	biology
 1281 . Soon after flowering , these plants die .	0	biology
 Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime .	1	biology
 Fruit trees , such as apple and orange trees , are polycarpic ; they flower every year .	0	biology
 1284 . Limits on Animal Size and ShapeAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape : this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends .	1	biology
 This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds .	0	biology
 1287 . The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat .	0	biology
 1293 . A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology

 The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1305 . Connective TissuesConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non - living substance , called the ground substance .	1	biology
 The ground substance is made of an organic substance ( usually a protein ) and an inorganic substance ( usually a mineral or water ) .	1	biology
 1308 . Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material .	1	biology
 The fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel .	0	biology
 1311 . The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	0	biology
 1314 . The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	0	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 Over time , these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient .	0	biology
 1317 . Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop .	0	biology
 It may either increase or decrease the stimulus , but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it .	0	biology
 1320 . Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system .	1	biology
 This is called acclimatization .	0	biology
 This occurs , for instance , when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to .	0	biology

 The gastro - esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus .	0	biology
 1338 . Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes .	0	biology
 The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme .	1	biology
 Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine .	0	biology
 1341 . The human small intestine is over 6 m long and is divided into three parts : the duodenum , the jejunum , and the ileum .	1	biology
 The “ C - shaped , ” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum .	1	biology
 1344 . Here , hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining .	0	biology
 The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum . The ileum , also illustrated in [ link ] is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream .	1	biology
 The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle .	0	biology
 1347 . The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination .	0	biology
 The anus is an opening at the far - end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material .	1	biology
 Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination : the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary .	0	biology
 1350 . The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts .	1	biology
 When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum , the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum .	0	biology
 1353 . Both fat - soluble and water - soluble vitamins must be obtained from food .	0	biology
 Minerals , listed in [ link ] , are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food .	1	biology
 Among their many functions , minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co - factors .	0	biology
 1356 . Pancreatic juices also contain amylase , which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose , a disaccharide .	1	biology
 The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases , sucrases , and lactases , which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall .	0	biology
 Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose .	0	biology
 1359 . The long - chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides , which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins .	1	biology
 These large spheres are called chylomicrons .	0	biology
 Chylomicrons contain triglycerides , cholesterol , and other lipids and have proteins on their surface .	0	biology
 1362 . The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions .	0	biology
 This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying .	0	biology
 1365 . Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 However , when the stomach is emptied , the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid .	0	biology
 This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism .	0	biology
 1368 . Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest .	0	biology
 A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed .	1	biology
 1371 . Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body .	0	biology
 The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .	1	biology
 An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .	1	biology
 1374 . Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath .	1	biology
 These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon .	0	biology
 1377 . Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	0	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .	1	biology
 1380 . This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .	1	biology
 1383 . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter .	0	biology
 Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential .	1	biology
 When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .	0	biology
 1386 . As K+ ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative .	0	biology
 The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell 's normal resting potential .	1	biology
 At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential .	0	biology
 1389 . Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft , the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 1392 . Signal SummationSometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential .	1	biology
 This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .	0	biology
 1395 . The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .	1	biology
 The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .	0	biology
 1398 . The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 1401 . It includes the cerebral cortex , limbic system , basal ganglia , thalamus , hypothalamus , and cerebellum .	0	biology
 There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures : a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in [ link]b , a coronal section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in [ link]a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . Cerebral CortexThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex , which is folded into hills called gyri ( singular : gyrus ) and valleys called sulci ( singular : sulcus ) .	1	biology
 The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .	0	biology
 1404 . The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain .	0	biology
 Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .	0	biology
 1407 . The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .	1	biology
 It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .	1	biology
 1410 . The thalamus ( Greek for “ inner chamber ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] , acts as a gateway to and from the cortex .	1	biology
 It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex .	0	biology
 1413 . It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala ( Greek for “ almond ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .	0	biology
 1416 . The brainstem , illustrated in [ link ] , connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord .	1	biology
 It consists of the midbrain , medulla oblongata , and the pons .	0	biology
 1419 . The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation .	1	biology
 One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake ( “ snake ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) .	0	biology
 1422 . While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and digest . ” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic , the parasympathetic nervous system is in control ( “ picnic ” and “ parasympathetic ” both start with “ p ” ) .	1	biology
 Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1425 . Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death .	1	biology
 These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die .	0	biology
 1428 . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder .	1	biology
 Its severity differs from person to person .	0	biology
 1431 . Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders .	1	biology
 To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder , a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed , changes in appetite and sleep schedules , difficulty concentrating , feelings of worthlessness , and suicidal thoughts .	0	biology
 1434 . Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	1	biology
 This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .	0	biology
 In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .	0	biology
 1437 . The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’s receptive field .	1	biology
 Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses .	0	biology
 1440 . Perception is an individual ’s interpretation of a sensation .	1	biology
 Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors , perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor , but at higher levels in the nervous system , in the brain .	0	biology
 1443 . Meissner ’s corpuscles , ( shown in [ link ] ) also known as tactile corpuscles , are found in the upper dermis , but they project into the epidermis .	1	biology
 They , too , are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids .	0	biology
 1446 . Neurons are not physically connected , but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or “ gaps ” between communicating neurons .	0	biology
 Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .	1	biology
 Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .	1	biology
 1449 . Audition , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions .	1	biology
 It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an approaching predator , and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating .	0	biology
 1452 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	0	biology
 1455 . The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear .	0	biology
 The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .	1	biology
 The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .	1	biology
 1458 . The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1461 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	1	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	0	biology
 The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 .	0	biology
 1464 . Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity , or brightness .	0	biology
 The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela , which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle .	1	biology
 1467 . The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 In conditions of high ambient light , the iris contracts , reducing the size of the pupil at its center .	0	biology
 1470 . For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina .	1	biology
 In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear .	0	biology
 1473 . Both rods and cones contain photopigments .	0	biology
 In vertebrates , the main photopigment , rhodopsin , has two main parts [ link ] ) : an opsin , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a cluster of α - helices that span the membrane ) , and retinal — a molecule that absorbs light .	1	biology
 When light hits a photoreceptor , it causes a shape change in the retinal , altering its structure from a bent ( cis ) form of the molecule to its linear ( trans ) isomer .	0	biology
 1476 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	0	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .	1	biology
 1479 . The first four tastes need little explanation .	0	biology
 The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later .	0	biology
 The taste of umami , also known as savoriness , is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L - glutamate .	1	biology
 1482 . Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 An olfactory receptor , which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron , responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain .	1	biology
 Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors , distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors .	0	biology
 1485 . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud .	1	biology
 A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 There are several structurally distinct papillae .	0	biology
 1488 . Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones .	1	biology
 1491 . The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain ( chain of amino acids ) .	0	biology
 The peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains , such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 1494 . In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1497 . In this way , nothing passes through the cell membrane ; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell .	0	biology
 The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger , which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1500 . In this way , a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product .	0	biology
 To stop hormone activity , cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase , or PDE .	0	biology
 PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity , preventing overproduction of cellular products . The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm .	1	biology
 1503 . In some cases , the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones , which is referred to as neural stimuli .	1	biology
 Recall that in a short - term stress response , the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond .	0	biology
 1506 . The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release - inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus , and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1509 . The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 It is a part of the brain , extending down from the hypothalamus , and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells , which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary .	1	biology
 0 . What is biology ?	0	biology
 In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments .	1	biology
 This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast .	0	biology
 3 . The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments .	0	biology
 A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested .	1	biology
 Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is .	0	biology
 6 . For some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics .	0	biology
 Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry .	1	biology
 Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary .	0	biology
 9 . Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science .	0	biology
 Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested . The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches .	1	biology
 18 . The introduction starts with brief , but broad , background information about what is known in the field .	1	biology
 A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work ; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented .	0	biology
 21 . Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both .	0	biology
 If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections , the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation .	1	biology
 The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .	0	biology
 27 . Atoms form molecules .	0	biology
 A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .	1	biology
 Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .	1	biology
 30 . Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts , which carry out indispensable functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars .	0	biology
 All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms .	1	biology
 ( This requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells .	0	biology
 33 . In larger organisms , cells combine to make tissues , which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions .	1	biology
 Organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function .	1	biology
 Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .	0	biology
 36 . All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population .	1	biology
 For example , a forest may include many pine trees .	0	biology
 39 . An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic , non - living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water .	1	biology
 At the highest level of organization ( [ link ] ) , the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems , and it represents the zones of life on earth .	1	biology
 It includes land , water , and even the atmosphere to a certain extent . Art ConnectionThe biological levels of organization of living things are shown .	0	biology
 42 . Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field .	0	biology
 For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .	0	biology
 Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .	1	biology
 45 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .	0	biology
 48 . Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass .	1	biology
 Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions .	1	biology
 There are 118 elements , but only 92 occur naturally .	0	biology
 51 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge .	0	biology
 A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged .	0	biology
 Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .	0	biology
 54 . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .	0	biology
 Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number .	0	biology
 63 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms .	0	biology
 Their non - reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases ( or noble gases ) .	0	biology
 Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left - hand column .	0	biology
 66 . Two electrons fill the 1s orbital , and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital .	0	biology
 Its electron configuration is 1s22s1 .	0	biology
 Neon ( Ne ) , on the other hand , has a total of ten electrons : two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell ( two each in the 2s and three p orbitals ) ; thus , it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms .	0	biology
 69 . Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart .	0	biology
 The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants ( usually found on the left side of a chemical equation ) , and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products ( usually found on the right side of a chemical equation ) .	1	biology
 An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction ; this direction is not always a “ one - way street . ” For the creation of the water molecule shown above , the chemical equation would be :	0	biology
 72 . Some chemical reactions , such as the one shown above , can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up .	0	biology
 The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .	0	biology
 Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .	0	biology
 78 . This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer .	1	biology
 As [ link ] illustrates , sodium ( Na ) only has one electron in its outer electron shell .	0	biology
 84 . Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally .	1	biology
 For example , molecular oxygen ( O2 ) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms .	0	biology
 87 . Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions .	0	biology
 A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -philic = “ loving ” ) .	1	biology
 In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .	0	biology
 90 . Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius .	1	biology
 For water , this amount is one calorie .	0	biology
 It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool .	0	biology
 93 . Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it .	0	biology
 Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds .	1	biology
 The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .	0	biology
 96 . Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress .	1	biology
 This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity .	0	biology
 99 . litmus or pH paper , filter paper that has been treated with a natural water - soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator , to test how much acid ( acidity ) or base ( alkalinity ) exists in a solution .	1	biology
 You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated .	0	biology
 102 . The pH scale is , as previously mentioned , an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Anything below 7.0 ( ranging from 0.0 to 6.9 ) is acidic , and anything above 7.0 ( from 7.1 to 14.0 ) is alkaline .	0	biology
 105 . Hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen , such as methane ( CH4 ) described above .	1	biology
 We often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels — like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter .	0	biology
 108 . The three - dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry .	0	biology
 Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .	1	biology
 Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	1	biology
 111 . Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three - dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images .	1	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , an amino acid alanine example , the two structures are non - superimposable .	0	biology
 114 . As you ’ve learned , biological macromolecules are large molecules , necessary for life , that are built from smaller organic molecules .	1	biology
 There are four major classes of biological macromolecules ( carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids ) ; each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions .	0	biology
 120 . Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula ( CH2O)n , where n is the number of carbons in the molecule .	0	biology
 In other words , the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules .	0	biology
 126 . Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer .	1	biology
 The cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose ; this provides structural support to the cell .	0	biology
 129 . The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar .	0	biology
 Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure .	0	biology
 Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .	0	biology
 132 . Cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond .	0	biology
 If hydrogens are present in the same plane , it is referred to as a cis fat ; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes , it is referred to as a trans fat .	0	biology
 The cis double bond causes a bend or a “ kink ” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly , keeping them liquid at room temperature ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 135 . Phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane , the outermost layer of animal cells .	1	biology
 Like fats , they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone .	0	biology
 141 . Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins .	1	biology
 Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure , which consists of a central carbon atom , also known as the alpha ( α ) carbon , bonded to an amino group ( NH2 ) , a carboxyl group ( COOH ) , and to a hydrogen atom .	0	biology
 144 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .	0	biology
 The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 147 . In nature , some proteins are formed from several polypeptides , also known as subunits , and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure .	0	biology
 Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure .	0	biology
 150 . The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .	0	biology
 DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms , ranging from single - celled bacteria to multicellular mammals .	1	biology
 153 . DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides .	0	biology
 The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide , DNA or RNA .	0	biology
 Each nucleotide is made up of three components : a nitrogenous base , a pentose ( five - carbon ) sugar , and a phosphate group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 156 . The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ ( 1′ is read as “ one prime ” ) .	0	biology
 The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide , which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage .	0	biology
 The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules : its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups .	0	biology
 159 . As you have learned , information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein .	0	biology
 DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription , and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation .	1	biology
 This is known as the Central Dogma of Life , which holds true for all organisms ; however , exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections .	0	biology
 162 . In contrast to light microscopes , electron microscopes ( [ link]b ) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light .	1	biology
 Not only does this allow for higher magnification and , thus , more detail ( [ link ] ) , it also provides higher resolving power .	0	biology
 165 . We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes .	0	biology
 Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of the cell : the nucleoid ( [ link]).This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell .	1	biology
 All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid , ribosomes , a cell membrane , and a cell wall .	0	biology
 168 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .	1	biology
 It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 171 . The nuclear envelope is a double - membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers .	0	biology
 174 . When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle , proteins are attached to chromosomes , and they resemble an unwound , jumbled bunch of threads .	0	biology
 These unwound protein - chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( [ link ] ) ; chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed .	1	biology
 177 . Mitochondria ( singular = mitochondrion ) are often called the “ powerhouses ” or “ energy factories ” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the cell ’s main energy - carrying molecule .	0	biology
 ATP represents the short - term stored energy of the cell .	1	biology
 180 . The centrosome is a microtubule - organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells .	1	biology
 It contains a pair of centrioles , two structures that lie perpendicular to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 183 . Like the mitochondria , chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes , but chloroplasts have an entirely different function .	0	biology
 Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis .	1	biology
 Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide , water , and light energy to make glucose and oxygen .	1	biology
 186 . Within the cytoplasm , there would still be ions and organic molecules , plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell , secure some organelles in specific positions , allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell , and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move .	1	biology
 Collectively , this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton : microfilaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 189 . The walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of α - tubulin and β - tubulin , two globular proteins ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 With a diameter of about 25 nm , microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton .	0	biology
 They help the cell resist compression , provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell , and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell .	0	biology
 192 . Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate - containing protein molecules called proteoglycans .	1	biology
 Collectively , these materials are called the extracellular matrix ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue , but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other .	0	biology
 195 . Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes , which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes .	1	biology
 198 . The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid .	0	biology
 Carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins , forming glycoproteins , or attached to lipids , forming glycolipids .	0	biology
 201 . The head can form hydrogen bonds , but the tail can not .	0	biology
 A molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged , or non - polar , area is referred to as amphiphilic or “ dual - loving . ”	1	biology
 204 . Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell , and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving .	0	biology
 In other words , plasma membranes are selectively permeable — they allow some substances to pass through , but not others .	1	biology
 If they were to lose this selectivity , the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself , and it would be destroyed .	0	biology
 207 . Diffusion is a passive process of transport .	1	biology
 A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space .	0	biology
 210 . The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins , and they function as either channels for the material or carriers .	1	biology
 In both cases , they are transmembrane proteins .	0	biology
 213 . Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein .	0	biology
 This aptly named protein binds a substance and , in doing so , triggers a change of its own shape , moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ( [ link ] ) ; depending on the gradient , the material may move in the opposite direction .	0	biology
 216 . Tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis .	1	biology
 A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .	0	biology
 219 . As for a hypertonic solution , the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does .	1	biology
 Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell .	0	biology
 222 . Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .	1	biology
 If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance .	0	biology
 225 . Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules .	0	biology
 Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .	1	biology
 Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .	0	biology
 228 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	1	biology
 231 . This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process .	0	biology
 The sodium - potassium pump is , therefore , an electrogenic pump ( a pump that creates a charge imbalance ) , creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential .	1	biology
 234 . A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis .	0	biology
 This literally means “ cell drinking ” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid .	0	biology
 237 . In receptor - mediated endocytosis , as in phagocytosis , clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor - mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective , the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood .	0	biology
 240 . Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used , cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy - requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place .	0	biology
 All of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells , including those that use energy and those that release energy , are the cell ’s metabolism .	1	biology
 243 . Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter .	1	biology
 The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system , and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings .	0	biology
 246 . However , a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work .	0	biology
 Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy .	1	biology
 A speeding bullet , a walking person , the rapid movement of molecules in the air ( which produces heat ) , and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy .	0	biology
 249 . How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction ?	0	biology
 A measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers .	0	biology
 Free energy is called Gibbs free energy ( abbreviated with the letter G ) after Josiah Willard Gibbs , the scientist who developed the measurement .	0	biology
 252 . Thus , the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy - storing molecules .	0	biology
 These chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions , and they are non - spontaneous .	1	biology
 An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy .	0	biology
 255 . The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings .	0	biology
 Heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) speeds up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they collide ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their transition state .	1	biology
 For this reason , heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently .	0	biology
 258 . The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme ’s substrates .	1	biology
 There may be one or more substrates , depending on the particular chemical reaction .	0	biology
 261 . This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step .	0	biology
 However , current research supports a more refined view called induced fit ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The induced - fit model expands upon the lock - and - key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate .	1	biology
 264 . Many enzymes do n’t work optimally , or even at all , unless bound to other specific non - protein helper molecules , either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds .	0	biology
 Two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes .	0	biology
 Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes .	0	biology
 267 . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable .	0	biology
 The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP , a process called dephosphorylation , releases energy .	1	biology
 270 . Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism , however , is derived from a much more complex process , chemiosmosis , which takes place in mitochondria ( [ link ] ) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell .	0	biology
 Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .	1	biology
 The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .	0	biology
 273 . Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism .	0	biology
 The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic .	1	biology
 Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells .	0	biology
 276 . If the cell can not catabolize the pyruvate molecules further , it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose .	0	biology
 Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respiration — the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen — and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP .	1	biology
 If glycolysis is interrupted , these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium - potassium pumps , and eventually , they die .	0	biology
 279 . As the protein passes along the Golgi ’s cisternae , it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates .	0	biology
 After its synthesis is complete , it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the Golgi ’s trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane .	0	biology

 282 . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( SER ) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates , lipids , and steroid hormones ; detoxification of medications and poisons ; and storage of calcium ions .	0	biology
 285 . Complex II directly receives FADH2 , which does not pass through complex I .	0	biology
 The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone ( Q ) .	1	biology
 The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane .	0	biology
 288 . In contrast , some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor .	0	biology
 Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen .	0	biology
 291 . Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .	1	biology
 A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars , not by using sunlight ’s energy , but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds ; hence , they are referred to as chemoautotrophs .	1	biology
 294 . The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss .	0	biology
 Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes . In all autotrophic eukaryotes , photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast .	0	biology
 For plants , chloroplast - containing cells exist in the mesophyll .	0	biology
 297 . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .	1	biology
 The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .	0	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis).Art Connection	1	biology
 5300 . Flash mobs are examples of collective behavior , noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage .	1	sociology
 Other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of teens adopting a favorite singer ’s hairstyle .	0	sociology
 5303 . Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .	1	sociology
 Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .	1	sociology
 5306 . The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .	1	sociology
 A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .	1	sociology
 A public , on the other hand , is an unorganized , relatively diffused group of people who share ideas , such as the Libertarian political party .	1	sociology
 5309 . Neil Smelser ’s ( 1962 ) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior , called value - added theory , is a perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur .	1	sociology
 Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur .	0	sociology
 5312 . Social organizations worldwide take stands on such general areas of concern as poverty , sex trafficking , and the use of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) in food .	0	sociology
 Nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) are sometimes formed to support such movements , such as the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement ( FOAM ) .	0	sociology
 Global efforts to reduce poverty are represented by the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief ( OXFAM ) , among others .	0	sociology
 5315 . is a revolutionary movement .	0	sociology
 Religious / Redemptive movements are “ meaning seeking , ” and their goal is to provoke inner change or spiritual growth in individuals .	1	sociology
 Organizations pushing these movements include Heaven ’s Gate or the Branch Davidians .	0	sociology
 5318 . Resource MobilizationMcCarthy and Zald ( 1977 ) conceptualize resource mobilization theory as a way to explain movement success in terms of the ability to acquire resources and mobilize individuals .	1	sociology
 Resources are primarily time and money , and the more of both , the greater the power of organized movements .	0	sociology
 5321 . Successful social movements use three kinds of frames ( Snow and Benford 1988 ) to further their goals .	0	sociology
 The first type , diagnostic framing , states the problem in a clear , easily understood way .	1	sociology
 When applying diagnostic frames , there are no shades of gray : instead , there is the belief that what “ they ” do is wrong and this is how “ we ” will fix it .	0	sociology
 5324 . In the gay marriage movement , a call to action might encourage you to vote “ no ” on Proposition 8 in California ( a move to limit marriage to male - female couples ) , or conversely , to contact your local congressperson to express your viewpoint that marriage should be restricted to male - female couples . With so many similar diagnostic frames , some groups find it best to join together to maximize their impact .	0	sociology
 When social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and merge into a single group , a frame alignment process ( Snow et al .	0	sociology
 1986 ) occurs — an ongoing and intentional means of recruiting participants to the movement .	1	sociology
 5327 . How has this technology affected social change in our society and others ?	0	sociology
 One very positive way is crowdsourcing . Thanks to the web , digital crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed services , ideas , or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people , and especially from an online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers .	1	sociology
 Web - based companies such as Kickstarter have been created precisely for the purposes of raising large amounts of money in a short period of time , notably by sidestepping the traditional financing process .	0	sociology
 5330 . Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .	1	sociology
 A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .	0	sociology
 5336 . It is impossible to study one without the other .	0	sociology
 German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior figuration .	1	sociology
 An application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion .	0	sociology
 5339 . This even applied to the researchers themselves , who , they believed , should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research .	0	sociology
 To deal with this problem , Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of verstehen , a German word that means to understand in a deep way .	1	sociology
" In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to "" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """	0	sociology
 5342 . Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .	0	sociology
 Qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in - depth interviews , focus groups , and analysis of content sources ( like books , magazines , journals , and popular media ) .	1	sociology
 5345 . Macro - level theories relate to large - scale issues and large groups of people , while micro - level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups .	1	sociology
 Grand theories attempt to explain large - scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change .	1	sociology
 Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete .	0	sociology
 5348 . Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .	0	sociology
 The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the social institutions , or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs , such as government , education , family , healthcare , religion , and the economy .	1	sociology
 5351 . Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society , but in order to study society , sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts .	0	sociology
 Social facts are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	1	sociology
 Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society .	0	sociology
 5354 . Conflict TheoryConflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources .	1	sociology
 This perspective is a macro - level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx ( 1818–1883 ) , who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social , material , and political resources such as food and housing , employment , education , and leisure time .	0	sociology
 5357 . Constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be .	1	sociology
 We develop social constructs based on interactions with others , and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed - upon or generally accepted by most within the society .	0	sociology
 5360 . People commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an occurrence .	0	sociology
 Social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason .	0	sociology
 A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .	1	sociology
 5363 . Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .	0	sociology
 Researchers also strive for validity , which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure .	1	sociology
 Returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic , reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon .	0	sociology
 5366 . A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related ; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables .	1	sociology
 In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .	0	sociology
 5369 . While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach , others operate from an interpretive framework .	0	sociology
 While systematic , this approach does n’t follow the hypothesis - testing model that seeks to find generalizable results .	0	sociology
 5372 . As a research method , a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions , often in the form of a questionnaire .	1	sociology
 The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods .	0	sociology
 5375 . The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .	0	sociology
 In a random sample , every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study .	1	sociology
 According to the laws of probability , random samples represent the population as a whole .	0	sociology
 5378 . The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses , some of which may be surprising .	0	sociology
 The benefit of written opinions , though , is the wealth of material that they provide . An interview is a one - on - one conversation between the researcher and the subject , and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic .	1	sociology
 Interviews are similar to the short - answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions .	0	sociology
 5381 . Later , he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology .	0	sociology
 However , Rothman ’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “ dot com ” company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material . Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation , in which researchers join people and participate in a group ’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context .	1	sociology
 This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life .	0	sociology
 5384 . One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment , meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis — a scientific approach .	1	sociology
 5387 . A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records .	0	sociology
 To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources , sociologists employ content analysis , applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand .	1	sociology
 5390 . Or if you are having coffee with a good friend , perhaps that question warrants a more detailed response .	0	sociology
 These examples are all aspects of culture , which is shared beliefs , values , and practices , that participants must learn .	1	sociology
 Sociologically , we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is expected , and in which situations perhaps it is not .	0	sociology
 5393 . ethnocentrism , or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one ’s own cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Ethnocentrism , as sociologist William Graham Sumner ( 1906 ) described the term , involves a belief or attitude that one ’s own culture is better than all others .	0	sociology
 5396 . Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .	0	sociology
 Beliefs are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true .	1	sociology
 Individuals in a society have specific beliefs , but they also share collective values .	0	sociology
 5399 . A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “ thank you . ” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus .	0	sociology
 People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .	0	sociology
 Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .	1	sociology
 5402 . Formal norms are established , written rules .	1	sociology
 They are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people .	0	sociology
 5405 . Writing another person ’s words as if they are one ’s own has a name — plagiarism .	1	sociology
 The consequences for violating this norm are severe and usually result in expulsion . Unlike mores , folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings .	1	sociology
 Rather , folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day - to - day practices and expressions of a culture .	0	sociology
 5408 . In the United States , for example , the number thirteen is associated with bad luck .	0	sociology
 In Japan , however , the number four is considered unlucky , since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “ death . ” The Sapir - Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language , and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language .	0	sociology
 The hypothesis , which has also been called linguistic relativity , states that language shapes thought ( Swoyer 2003 ) .	1	sociology
 5411 . Subculture and CountercultureA subculture is just what it sounds like — a smaller cultural group within a larger culture ; people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group .	1	sociology
 5420 . Hunter - gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various types of preindustrial societies .	0	sociology
 As the basic structure of human society until about 10,000–12,000 years ago , these groups were based around kinship or tribes .	0	sociology
 5429 . His primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing , and people were becoming more divided .	0	sociology
 In his book The Division of Labor in Society ( 1893 ) , Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the transition from mechanical to organic . Preindustrial societies , Durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical solidarity , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture .	0	sociology
 Societies with mechanical solidarity act in a mechanical fashion ; things are done mostly because they have always been done that way .	0	sociology
 5432 . Additionally , Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change .	0	sociology
 Economically , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the bourgeoisie — and the laborers , called the proletariat .	1	sociology
 Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution .	0	sociology
 5435 . Another idea that Marx developed is the concept of false consciousness .	0	sociology
 False consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs , ideals , or ideology of a person are not in the person ’s own best interest .	1	sociology
 5438 . The symbolic interactionism theory , the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology , is based on Weber ’s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society .	0	sociology
 For Weber , the culmination of industrialization , rationalization , and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage , in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy .	1	sociology
 This leads to a sense of “ disenchantment of the world , ” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity .	1	sociology
 5441 . Another way of looking at this concept is through W.I .	0	sociology
 Thomas ’s notable Thomas theorem which states , “ If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( Thomas and Thomas 1928 ) .	0	sociology
 That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .	0	sociology
 5444 . Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .	1	sociology
 Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 5450 . All we can observe is behavior , or role performance .	0	sociology
 Role performance is how a person expresses his or her role .	1	sociology
 Sociologist Erving Goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage .	0	sociology
 5456 . And commuting times and distances have continued to increase as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers .	0	sociology
 Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .	1	sociology
 Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	1	sociology
 5459 . As the Social Policy & Debate feature illustrates , the suburbs also have their share of socio - economic problems .	0	sociology
 In the United States , white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from racially mixed urban areas and toward the suburbs .	1	sociology
 This occurred throughout the twentieth century , due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by Brown v. Board of Education to the Mariel boatlift of Cubans fleeing Cuba ’s Mariel port for Miami .	0	sociology
 5465 . While you might be more familiar with the phrase “ global warming , ” climate change is the term now used to refer to long - term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and , in particular , the release of greenhouse gases into the environment .	1	sociology
 The planet as a whole is warming , but the term climate change acknowledges that the short - term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures , despite the overarching trend toward warmth .	0	sociology
 5468 . Often , the stories are not newsmakers , but simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as Centralia , Pennsylvania and Hinkley , California .	0	sociology
 In many cases , people in these neighborhoods can be part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause .	0	sociology
 5471 . Where will people live ?	0	sociology
 To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .	1	sociology
 Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .	1	sociology
 5474 . Changing fertility , mortality , and migration rates make up the total population composition , a snapshot of the demographic profile of a population .	1	sociology
 This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .	0	sociology
 5477 . Ehrlich 's ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse , as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources such as water and air .	0	sociology
 He advocated for a goal of zero population growth ( ZPG ) , in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration .	1	sociology
 While support for this concept is mixed , it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation .	0	sociology
 5480 . Later , George Herbert Mead ( 1863–1931 ) studied the self , a person ’s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction .	1	sociology
 In order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others .	0	sociology
 5483 . Most importantly , we have to learn language — whether it ’s the dominant language or one common in a subculture , whether it ’s verbal or through signs — in order to communicate and to think .	0	sociology
 As we saw with Danielle , without socialization we literally have no self . Nature versus NurtureSome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture — the relationships and caring that surround us .	1	sociology
 Others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics .	0	sociology
 5486 . Just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers , play house , and dress up , adults also engage in anticipatory socialization , the preparation for future life roles .	1	sociology
 Examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon - to - be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new arrival .	0	sociology
 5489 . Peer GroupsA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests .	1	sociology
 Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years , such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns , the rules of a game , or how to shoot a basket .	0	sociology
 5492 . The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby .	1	sociology
 In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group .	0	sociology
 5495 . Types of GroupsSociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864–1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) .	0	sociology
 According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives .	0	sociology
 5498 . The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way .	0	sociology
 Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840–1910 ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .	0	sociology
 In short , an in - group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .	1	sociology
 5501 . After all , how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders ?	0	sociology
 Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .	1	sociology
 An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .	1	sociology
 5504 . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high - profile woman who is an instrumental leader .	0	sociology
 Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .	0	sociology
 Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .	1	sociology
 5507 . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress .	0	sociology
 As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks .	1	sociology
 These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals .	0	sociology
 5510 . From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .	0	sociology
 Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .	0	sociology
 A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization .	1	sociology
 5513 . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .	0	sociology
 Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) .	0	sociology
 A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .	1	sociology
 5516 . A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform .	1	sociology
 For example , psychology professors teach psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms .	0	sociology
 5519 . This results in an impersonal organization .	0	sociology
 Customers frequently complain that stores like Walmart care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice .	1	sociology
 In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript .	0	sociology
 5522 . And what is the relationship between deviance and crime ?	0	sociology
 According to sociologist William Graham Sumner , deviance is a violation of established contextual , cultural , or social norms , whether folkways , mores , or codified law ( 1906 ) .	1	sociology
 It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder .	0	sociology
 5525 . Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .	0	sociology
 When a worker violates a workplace guideline , the manager steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules , the manager may praise or promote the employee . The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions .	1	sociology
 Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .	0	sociology
 5528 . Although shoplifting , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose .	0	sociology
 That does n’t mean picking your nose in public wo n’t be punished ; instead , you will encounter informal sanctions .	0	sociology
 Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .	0	sociology
 5531 . Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s , social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control .	1	sociology
 An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use , violence , teenage delinquency , and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community .	0	sociology
 5534 . Conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher , economist , and social scientist Karl Marx .	0	sociology
 Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups .	0	sociology
 5537 . Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation .	0	sociology
 Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others .	1	sociology
 Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept .	0	sociology
 5540 . Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) .	0	sociology
 His conclusions established differential association theory , which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance .	1	sociology
 According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes .	0	sociology
 5543 . In modern U.S. society , crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity .	0	sociology
 Violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force .	1	sociology
 Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .	0	sociology
 5546 . When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .	1	sociology
 An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .	1	sociology
 Embezzlement , insider trading , and identity theft are all types of corporate crime .	0	sociology
 5549 . Due to these issues , the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes a separate self - report study known as the National Crime Victimization Report ( NCVR ) .	0	sociology
 A self - report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods , such as questionnaires or telephone interviews .	1	sociology
 Self - report data are gathered each year , asking approximately 160,000 people in the United States about the frequency and types of crime they ’ve experienced in their daily lives ( BJS 2013 ) .	0	sociology
 5552 . CourtsOnce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police , the case goes to court .	0	sociology
 A court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law .	1	sociology
 The U.S. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts .	0	sociology
 5555 . The first is differential class - based access to technology in the form of the digital divide .	0	sociology
 This digital divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology .	1	sociology
 Simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools .	0	sociology
 5558 . According to the functionalist perspective , health is vital to the stability of the society , and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance .	0	sociology
 Talcott Parsons ( 1951 ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them .	0	sociology
 5561 . As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness .	1	sociology
 The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .	1	sociology
 A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .	1	sociology
 5564 . Unfortunately , the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2013 shows that 18 percent of people in the United States have no health insurance at all .	0	sociology
 Equally alarming , a study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that in 2010 , 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured ; that is , people who pay at least 10 percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least 5 percent of their income ( Schoen , Doty , Robertson , and Collins 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 The Commonwealth study further reports that while underinsurance has historically been an issue that low - income families faced , today it is affecting middle - income families more and more . Why are so many people uninsured or underinsured ?	0	sociology
 5567 . The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free healthcare to all its residents .	0	sociology
 And despite some U.S. citizens’ knee - jerk reaction to any healthcare changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration . It is important to distinguish between socialized medicine , in which the government owns the healthcare system , and universal healthcare , which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone .	1	sociology
 Germany , Singapore , and Canada all have universal healthcare .	0	sociology
 5570 . Marilyn Winkleby and her research associates ( 1992 ) state that “ one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of a person 's morbidity and mortality experience is that person 's socioeconomic status ( SES ) .	0	sociology
 This finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions , continues throughout the entire lifespan , and extends across numerous risk factors for disease . ” Morbidity is the incidence of disease . It is important to remember that economics are only part of the SES picture ; research suggests that education also plays an important role .	1	sociology
 Phelan and Link ( 2003 ) note that many behavior - influenced diseases like lung cancer ( from smoking ) , coronary artery disease ( from poor eating and exercise habits ) , and AIDS initially were widespread across SES groups .	0	sociology
 5573 . Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time .	1	sociology
 Anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorders , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and both social and specific phobias . The second most common mental disorders in the United States are mood disorders ; roughly 10 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected yearly , while 21 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .	0	sociology
 Major mood disorders are depression , bipolar disorder , and dysthymic disorder .	0	sociology
 5576 . The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 They use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations , while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation .	1	sociology
 Before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) in 1990 , people in the United States with disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted .	0	sociology
 5579 . Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases .	1	sociology
 Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations .	0	sociology
 5582 . The stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it worse than it needs to be .	0	sociology
 Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals .	1	sociology
 Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients’ heads , depending on the opinion of the medical professional .	0	sociology
 5585 . These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .	0	sociology
 The second type of patent is a design patent .	0	sociology
 Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .	1	sociology
 5588 . New media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange .	1	sociology
 These include social networking sites , blogs , podcasts , wikis , and virtual worlds .	0	sociology
 5591 . But the numbers are misleading .	0	sociology
 Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .	1	sociology
 This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .	1	sociology
 5594 . Such a fast - paced dynamic is not always to our benefit .	0	sociology
 Some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction , a result in which people are too overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue , so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action ( Lazerfeld and Merton 1948 ) .	1	sociology
 5597 . Increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism , the application to , and promotion of , feminism online .	1	sociology
 Research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by women living in Iraq during the second Gulf War ( Peirce 2011 ) to an investigation of the Suicide Girls web site ( Magnet 2007 ) .	0	sociology
 4617 . Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .	0	economic
 Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .	1	economic
 4620 . In the United States , the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person : Mollie Orshansky .	0	economic
 In 1963 , Orshansky , who was working for the Social Security Administration , published an article called “ Children of the Poor ” in a highly useful and dry - as - dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin .	0	economic
 4623 . As a result , the person experiences no net gain for working .	0	economic
 Economists call this problem the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4626 . The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor .	1	economic
 Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .	0	economic
 4629 . From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .	1	economic
 This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .	0	economic
 4632 . Often called “ food stamps , ” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is a federally funded program , started in 1964 , in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food .	1	economic
 The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income , number of children , and other factors but , in general , households are expected to spend about 30 % of their own net income on food , and if 30 % of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet , then those households are eligible for SNAP.SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap .	0	economic
 4635 . Medicaid was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government .	1	economic
 The federal government helps fund Medicaid , but each state is responsible for administering the program , determining the level of benefits , and determining eligibility .	0	economic
 4638 . For example , you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution .	0	economic
 [ link ] presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a Lorenz curve .	0	economic
 The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis .	1	economic
 4644 . Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that , even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools , each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests , desires , talents , and efforts .	0	economic
 Some of those initiatives include those shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 4647 . A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .	1	economic
 Thus , negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining . The subject of labor unions can be controversial .	1	economic
 Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers’ primary line of defense against efforts by profit - seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits .	0	economic
 4650 . Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record - keeping and computer - operated cabs for loading and unloading ships — changes which the union opposed , along with overtime pay .	0	economic
 President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft - Hartley Act — where a court can impose an 80-day “ cooling - off period ” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage .	1	economic
 Federal mediators were called in , and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015 .	0	economic
 4653 . The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions .	0	economic
 The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor - Management Relations Act of 1935 , which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so .	1	economic
 The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all - out production efforts needed during World War II .	0	economic
 4656 . Investigating the Black / White Earnings GapBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century .	0	economic
 Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker , regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker .	0	economic
 Moreover , blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities , which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs .	0	economic
 4659 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .	1	economic
 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .	1	economic
 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .	1	economic
 4662 . Today , affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit .	0	economic
 This type of redress is enforced by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) .	0	economic
 4665 . In August 2009 , many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall - style meetings to discuss President Obama ’s proposed changes to the U.S. healthcare system .	1	economic
 This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) or as the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but was more popularly known as Obamacare .	0	economic
 The bill ’s opponents’ claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $ 750 billion to the deficit , to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so - called “ death panels ” that decide which critically - ill patients receive care and which do not .	0	economic
 4668 . Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .	1	economic
 Let ’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods , labor , and financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold .	0	economic
 4671 . A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .	1	economic
 By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .	1	economic
 When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating , markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price .	0	economic
 4674 . “ If only you knew more economics , you would not be so irrational , ” is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying .	0	economic
 A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion , because so much of this so - called “ quirky ” behavior is extremely common among us .	0	economic
 For example , a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $ 10 bill today , and also got an extra $ 10 in your paycheck , you should feel perfectly neutral .	0	economic
 4677 . Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .	1	economic
 The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .	1	economic
 Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars , appliances and even houses .	0	economic
 4680 . In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .	0	economic
 Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .	1	economic
 4683 . Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .	1	economic
 Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .	1	economic
 4686 . Unemployment insurance : Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance , which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time , usually six months , after they lose their jobs .	1	economic
 4689 . Workman ’s compensation insurance : Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds , typically run at the state level , that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job .	1	economic
 4692 . Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance .	1	economic
 For example , if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor , you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor ’s visit .	0	economic
 4695 . Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .	1	economic
 Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .	1	economic
 For example , insurance might pay for 80 % of the costs of repairing a home after a fire , but the homeowner would pay the other 20 % .	0	economic
 4698 . Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high - risk or low - risk than the insurance company does .	1	economic
 This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high - risk tend to want to buy more insurance , without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk .	0	economic
 4701 . In March of 2010 , President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) .	0	economic
 This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013 .	0	economic
 4704 . Individuals can not , however , take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year , write a letter to General Motors or some other firm , and negotiate to invest their money with that firm .	0	economic
 Financial capital markets bridge this gap : that is , they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital .	1	economic
 Such financial markets include stocks , bonds , bank loans , and other financial investments .	0	economic
 4707 . They also provide advice on potential products , customers , and key employees .	0	economic
 Typically , a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms , and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs . The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year : as one example , venture capital firms invested more than $ 48.3 billion in 2014 , according to the National Venture Capital Association .	1	economic
 All early - stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big ; indeed , many of them will go out of business within a few months or years .	0	economic
 4710 . A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .	1	economic
 For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury .	1	economic
 4713 . Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .	0	economic
 Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .	1	economic
 4716 . First , a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public ( the public includes individuals , mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension funds ) .	0	economic
 A firm ’s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering ( IPO ) .	1	economic
 The IPO is important for two reasons .	0	economic
 4719 . A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .	1	economic
 A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .	1	economic
 4722 . Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance , the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives , fails , as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman Brothers shows . How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure ?	1	economic
 4725 . It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .	0	economic
 Risk measures the uncertainty of that project ’s profitability .	1	economic
 There are several types of risk , including default risk and interest rate risk .	0	economic
 4728 . Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs .	0	economic
 A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .	1	economic
 A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .	1	economic
 4731 . In part , this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer .	0	economic
 In addition , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) protects the savings of the average person .	1	economic
 Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC , based on the size of its deposits .	0	economic
 4734 . This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .	0	economic
 The bond has a coupon rate or interest rate , which is usually semi - annual , but can be paid at different times throughout the year .	0	economic
 ( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . )	0	economic
 4737 . The bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time .	1	economic
 Bonds are bought not only when they are issued ; they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes .	0	economic
 4740 . An individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions .	0	economic
 Thus , a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification , which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies .	1	economic
 A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb : “ Do n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ” In any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse — but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value .	0	economic
 4743 . About two - thirds of U.S. households own their own home .	0	economic
 An owner ’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house .	0	economic
 For example , imagine that you buy a house for $ 200,000 , paying 10 % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ 180,000 .	0	economic
 4746 . Compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest .	1	economic
 4749 . In 2002 , Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) .	0	economic
 The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns .	0	economic
 4752 . As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .	0	economic
 In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .	0	economic
 4755 . The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high , while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower .	0	economic
 One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by AARP , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance .	0	economic
 4758 . For example , policies that impose price controls — like rent control — may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords .	0	economic
 However , when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area , a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available .	0	economic
 4761 . Democracy is sometimes summed up ( and oversimplified ) in two words : “ Majority rule . ” When voters face three or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers .	1	economic
 4764 . The situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B , Choice B is preferred by a majority over Choice C , and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A is called a voting cycle .	1	economic
 It is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur .	0	economic
 4767 . In April 2009 , the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking it to investigate tire imports from China .	0	economic
 Under U.S. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States , as determined by the ITC , then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption .	0	economic
 4770 . Who buys all of this production ?	0	economic
 This demand can be divided into four main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports .	1	economic
 ( See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment . )	0	economic
 4773 . The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports ( X ) minus the dollar value of imports ( M ) , ( X – M ) .	1	economic
 The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .	1	economic
 If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 4776 . Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades , even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 .	0	economic
 As noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total GDP .	0	economic
 4779 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .	0	economic
 Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .	1	economic
 4782 . Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .	1	economic
 The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .	1	economic
 4785 . Similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced .	0	economic
 The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .	1	economic
 The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .	1	economic
 4788 . [ link ] shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960 .	0	economic
 Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .	0	economic
 4791 . A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .	1	economic
 An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .	1	economic
 The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 4794 . Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .	0	economic
 The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle .	1	economic
 It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough - to - peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960 .	0	economic
 4797 . Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .	1	economic
 Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) equivalent exchange rates .	0	economic
 Market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets .	1	economic
 4800 . One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that , as of 1970 , only about 42 % of women participated in the paid labor force .	0	economic
 By the second decade of the 2000s , nearly 60 % of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .	0	economic
 As women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy , which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed .	0	economic
 4803 . Before the last two centuries , although rulers , nobles , and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries . Progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .	0	economic
 According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .	0	economic
 The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .	1	economic
 4806 . Economic growth depends on many factors .	0	economic
 Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently .	0	economic
 Laws must be clear , public , fair , enforced , and equally applicable to all members of society .	0	economic
 4809 . The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change .	0	economic
 Technological change is a combination of invention — advances in knowledge — and innovation , which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service .	1	economic
 For example , the transistor was invented in 1947 .	0	economic
 4812 . While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 ( around 3 % ) , it has slowed down since then .	0	economic
 Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages .	0	economic
 Over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce .	0	economic
 4815 . The category of technology is the “ joker in the deck . ” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation .	0	economic
 When most people think of new technology , the invention of new products like the laser , the smartphone , or some new wonder drug come to mind .	0	economic
 4818 . When society increases the level of capital per person , the result is called capital deepening .	1	economic
 The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker .	0	economic
 4821 . Some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence , in which their economies grow faster than those of high - income countries .	0	economic
 GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7 % per year in the 1990s and 2.3 % per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high - income countries of the world , which include the United States , Canada , the countries of the European Union , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .	0	economic
 4824 . How did these incomes increase ?	0	economic
 The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital .	1	economic
 Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence .	0	economic

 4833 . One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy .	0	economic
 If firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right .	0	economic
 4836 . In other words , these people are involuntarily unemployed .	0	economic
 What causes involuntary unemployment ?	0	economic
 4839 . One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract , which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble , and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong .	0	economic
 This wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times .	0	economic
 4842 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .	1	economic
 However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .	1	economic
 4845 . In a market economy , some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that happened to make bad decisions ; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is desired ; a large customer who went broke ; or tough domestic or foreign competitors .	0	economic
 Conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees .	0	economic
 4848 . However , adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly .	0	economic
 Wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year .	0	economic
 In many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level .	0	economic
 4851 . Sure , the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive .	0	economic
 Sure , per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2014 , but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years ?	0	economic
 Not likely . A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand .	0	economic
 4854 . To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods .	0	economic
 Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .	1	economic
 4857 . The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .	0	economic
 In recent years , the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility .	0	economic
 4860 . As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending .	1	economic
 Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables .	1	economic
 In this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living .	0	economic
 4863 . There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .	1	economic
 An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .	1	economic
 The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .	1	economic
 4866 . Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of 1920–1921 , the Great Depression , the recession of 1980–1982 , and the Great Recession in 2008–2009 .	0	economic
 There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary , but not at an annual rate .	0	economic

 Consider a very short story : “ The Land of Funny Money . ”	0	economic
 4872 . The problem of a good - looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly - looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes .	0	economic
 The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an adjustment for inflation .	0	economic
 4875 . The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles .	0	economic
 These plans are tax deferred , and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer , their 401(k ) comes with them .	0	economic
 To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners . However , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation .	0	economic
 4878 . Inflation can make long - term planning difficult .	0	economic
 In discussing unintended redistributions , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation .	0	economic
 Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty .	0	economic
 4881 . An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .	1	economic
 A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs .	0	economic
 Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation .	0	economic
 4884 . The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing .	0	economic
 Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972 , the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index .	0	economic
 Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .	1	economic
 4887 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .	1	economic
 If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .	1	economic
 4890 . A few decades ago , it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes , trains , and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade .	1	economic
 This measurement is called the merchandise trade balance .	0	economic
 In most high - income economies , including the United States , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services compose more than half .	0	economic
 4893 . Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) within the U.S. Department of Commerce , using a variety of different sources .	0	economic
 4896 . The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers , which are payments made by government , private charities , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received .	1	economic
 Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category , as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities .	0	economic

 4902 . The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .	0	economic
 In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .	0	economic
 4905 . When the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital .	0	economic
 The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways .	0	economic
 4908 . A nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these two are actually quite separate .	0	economic
 It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports .	0	economic
 A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is exported .	1	economic
 4911 . The next three chapters take up this task .	0	economic
 This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium .	0	economic
 This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals .	1	economic
 4914 . The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy .	1	economic
 Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists . If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur .	1	economic
 To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .	0	economic
 3311 . To explore these questions , let ’s start by focusing on a specific disease , sickle - cell anemia , and how it might affect two infected sisters .	0	psychology
 Sickle - cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells , which are normally round , take on a crescent - like shape ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology

 3317 . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles .	0	psychology
 An allele is a specific version of a gene .	1	psychology
 So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes .	0	psychology
 3320 . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene .	0	psychology
 A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent .	0	psychology
 In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .	1	psychology
 3326 . Sickle - cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes .	0	psychology
 For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts .	1	psychology
 If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders .	0	psychology
 3329 . Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes .	0	psychology
 A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene .	1	psychology
 While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation .	0	psychology
 3332 . In another approach to gene - environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways .	1	psychology
 In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes .	0	psychology
 3335 . Genes affect more than our physical characteristics .	0	psychology
 Indeed , scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics , ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality ( for examples , see Mustanski et al . , 2005 ; Comings , Gonzales , Saucier , Johnson , & MacMurray , 2000 ) .	0	psychology
 3338 . Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically .	0	psychology
 Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .	1	psychology
 Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .	0	psychology
 3341 . Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A neuron ’s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane .	0	psychology
 This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it , while stopping larger or highly charged molecules .	1	psychology
 3344 . The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .	0	psychology
 These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .	0	psychology
 The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .	1	psychology
 3347 . In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs .	1	psychology
 Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .	0	psychology
 3350 . The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .	0	psychology
 This difference in charge across the membrane , called the membrane potential , provides energy for the signal .	1	psychology
 3353 . With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive .	0	psychology
 If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential .	1	psychology
 At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open .	0	psychology
 3356 . Because it is all or none , the action potential is recreated , or propagated , at its full strength at every point along the axon .	0	psychology
 Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker , it does not fade away as it travels down the axon .	0	psychology
 3362 . Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .	1	psychology
 An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .	1	psychology
 Agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person ’s condition .	0	psychology
 3365 . The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control .	1	psychology
 It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3368 . His pupils dilate , his heart rate and blood pressure increase , his bladder relaxes , his liver releases glucose , and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream .	1	psychology
 This constellation of physiological changes , known as the fight or flight response , allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety .	0	psychology
 3371 . When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment , all lower segments are cut off from the brain , causing paralysis .	0	psychology
 Therefore , the lower on the spine damage is , the fewer functions an injured individual loses . The Two HemispheresThe surface of the brain , known as the cerebral cortex , is very uneven , characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps , known as gyri ( singular : gyrus ) , and grooves , known as sulci ( singular : sulcus ) , shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .	0	psychology
 3374 . The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons .	1	psychology
 The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side . Normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day - to - day functions , but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well .	0	psychology
 3377 . The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .	0	psychology
 It contains the motor cortex , which is involved in planning and coordinating movement ; the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for higher - level cognitive functioning ; and Broca ’s area , which is essential for language production .	1	psychology
 3380 . The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .	1	psychology
 It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .	1	psychology
 3383 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .	1	psychology
 The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology
 Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .	0	psychology
 3386 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .	0	psychology
 The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .	1	psychology
 3389 . The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures , but three of the most important are the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the hypothalamus ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .	1	psychology
 The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .	1	psychology
 3392 . In 1953 , Henry Gustav Molaison ( H. M. ) was a 27-year - old man who experienced severe seizures .	0	psychology
 In an attempt to control his seizures , H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala .	0	psychology
 3395 . The substantia nigra ( Latin for “ black substance ” ) and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are also located in the midbrain ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine , and both are critical for movement .	0	psychology
 3398 . The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .	1	psychology
 The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .	1	psychology
 It also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep .	0	psychology
 3401 . Brain ImagingYou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain .	0	psychology
 Increasingly , however , we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury .	0	psychology
 In this section , we take a more in - depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain , including techniques that rely on radiation , magnetic fields , or electrical activity within the brain .	0	psychology
 3404 . In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field .	1	psychology
 The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’s cells to move .	0	psychology
 3407 . The endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Like neurotransmitters , hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal .	1	psychology
 3410 . The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .	1	psychology
 The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .	1	psychology
 3413 . Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive , strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm .	0	psychology
 Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board ( IRB ) .	0	psychology
 The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution ’s administration , scientists , and community members ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3416 . For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .	0	psychology
 In cases where deception is involved , participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study — complete , honest information about the purpose of the experiment , how the data collected will be used , the reasons why deception was necessary , and information about how to obtain additional information about the study .	0	psychology
 3419 . Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants , animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) .	0	psychology
 An IACUC consists of institutional administrators , scientists , veterinarians , and community members .	1	psychology
 3422 . The sign — positive or negative — of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction .	1	psychology
 Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .	0	psychology
 3425 . However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .	0	psychology
 While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .	0	psychology
 In the ice cream / crime rate example mentioned earlier , temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables .	0	psychology
 3428 . Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid .	0	psychology
 Or , we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch , ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false ; this is known as confirmation bias .	1	psychology
 Other times , we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind , even if that information is severely limited .	0	psychology
 3431 . The two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference— experimental manipulation .	0	psychology
 The experimental group gets the experimental manipulation — that is , the treatment or variable being tested ( in this case , violent TV images)—and the control group does not .	1	psychology
 Since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups , we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance .	0	psychology
 3434 . By being blind to which child is in which group , we protect against those biases .	0	psychology
 This situation is a single - blind study , meaning that one of the groups ( participants ) are unaware as to which group they are in ( experiment or control group ) while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group .	0	psychology
 3437 . To achieve this , we must pay attention to two important variables , or things that can be changed , in any experimental study : the independent variable and the dependent variable .	0	psychology
 An independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter .	1	psychology
 In a well - designed experimental study , the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups .	0	psychology
 3440 . If possible , we should use a random sample ( there are other types of samples , but for the purposes of this chapter , we will focus on random samples ) .	0	psychology
 A random sample is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected .	1	psychology
 Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population .	0	psychology
 3443 . Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups , a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups .	0	psychology
 A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance ( and thus not meaningful ) .	0	psychology
 3446 . Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection .	0	psychology
 Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result .	1	psychology
 In the context of psychological research , this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent , reproducible ways .	0	psychology
 3449 . If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior , focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole .	0	psychology
 Generalizing refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society .	1	psychology
 Again , case studies provide enormous amounts of information , but since the cases are so specific , the potential to apply what ’s learned to the average person may be very limited .	0	psychology
 3452 . The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity , or accuracy , of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting .	0	psychology
 Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity , or realism , than we might achieve with other research approaches .	1	psychology
 3455 . Often , psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data .	0	psychology
 Surveys are lists of questions to be answered by research participants , and can be delivered as paper - and - pencil questionnaires , administered electronically , or conducted verbally ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Generally , the survey itself can be completed in a short time , and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people .	0	psychology
 3458 . When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time , we are conducting longitudinal research .	1	psychology
 Longitudinal research is a research design in which data - gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time .	1	psychology
 For example , we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20 , retest them a decade later at age 30 , and then again at age 40 .	0	psychology
 3461 . In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others , such as intuition and personal experience , the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim .	0	psychology
 Scientific knowledge is empirical : It is grounded in objective , tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again , regardless of who is observing . While behavior is observable , the mind is not .	1	psychology
 If someone is crying , we can see behavior .	0	psychology
 3464 . Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .	1	psychology
 In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .	0	psychology
 Basically , ideas ( in the form of theories and hypotheses ) are tested against the real world ( in the form of empirical observations ) , and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world , and so on .	1	psychology
 3467 . A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct , and it is often worded as an if - then statement ( e.g. , if I study all night , I will get a passing grade on the test ) .	1	psychology
 The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world .	0	psychology
 3470 . Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ) ; in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .	1	psychology
 The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 3473 . In most areas of psychology , this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology .	0	psychology
 Literally , PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree , but here , philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se .	1	psychology
 Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .	0	psychology
 3476 . Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree , which is known as a PsyD .	0	psychology
 A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology .	0	psychology
 PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research - oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context ( Norcorss & Castle , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 3479 . Evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades .	0	psychology
 To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause .	0	psychology
 3482 . Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan .	1	psychology
 Developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation .	0	psychology
 3485 . More recently , the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach .	0	psychology
 Rather than explaining how personality arises , research is focused on identifying personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation .	0	psychology
 Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .	1	psychology
 3488 . Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted .	0	psychology
 Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience .	0	psychology
 After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial .	0	psychology
 3491 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors . This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy , education , intervention , and research .	0	psychology
 3494 . As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .	0	psychology
 Counseling psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional , social , vocational , and health - related outcomes in individuals who are considered psychologically healthy .	1	psychology
 3497 . Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832–1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist .	0	psychology
 His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 .	0	psychology
 3500 . William James ( 1842–1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 James was introduced to Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’s characteristics .	0	psychology
 3503 . According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue .	0	psychology
 Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .	1	psychology
 3506 . John B. Watson ( 1878–1958 ) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed .	0	psychology
 3509 . The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button .	1	psychology
 When the animal pushes the button or lever , the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a noise ) or a token conditioner ( such as a light ) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment .	0	psychology
 3512 . Carl Rogers ( 1902–1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client - centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 3515 . We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep .	0	psychology
 Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .	1	psychology
 Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .	1	psychology
 3518 . This pattern of temperature fluctuation , which repeats every day , is one example of a circadian rhythm .	0	psychology
 A circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours .	1	psychology
 Our sleep - wake cycle , which is linked to our environment ’s natural light - dark cycle , is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm , but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate , blood pressure , blood sugar , and body temperature .	0	psychology
 3521 . The brain ’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) .	0	psychology
 The axons of light - sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present , allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world ( Klein , Moore , & Reppert , 1991 ; Welsh , Takahashi , & Kay , 2010 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3524 . These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person ’s chronotype , and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation ( Taillard , Philip , Coste , Sagaspe , & Bioulac , 2003 ) .	1	psychology
 Sleep regulation refers to the brain ’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world .	1	psychology
 3527 . Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles .	0	psychology
 Rotating shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis .	1	psychology
 For example , a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday , 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday , and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday .	0	psychology
 3530 . Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation .	0	psychology
 Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep - deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep .	1	psychology
 Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well ( [ link]).This is a segment of a polysonograph ( PSG ) , a recording of several physical variables during sleep .	1	psychology
 3533 . Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .	0	psychology
 In contrast , non - REM ( NREM ) sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves .	0	psychology
 The first four stages of sleep are NREM sleep , while the fifth and final stage of sleep is REM sleep .	0	psychology
 3536 . As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep , there is an increase in theta wave activity .	0	psychology
 Theta waves are even lower frequency ( 4–7 Hz ) , higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves .	1	psychology
 It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep ; in fact , people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep .	0	psychology
 3539 . In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .	0	psychology
 A K - complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli .	1	psychology
 Thus , K - complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments ( Halász , 1993 ; Steriade & Amzica , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 3542 . Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams .	0	psychology
 Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .	1	psychology
 Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .	1	psychology
 3545 . Among a variety of neurobiological evidence , John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general .	0	psychology
 Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state .	1	psychology
 In a lucid dream , a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming , and as such , they can control the dream ’s content ( LaBerge , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 3548 . In sleepwalking , or somnambulism , the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile .	1	psychology
 During periods of sleepwalking , sleepers often have their eyes open , but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them .	0	psychology
 3551 . Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment ( Mahowald & Schenck , 2000 ) .	1	psychology
 Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake , they generally have no memories of the events that occurred , and attempts to console them are ineffective .	0	psychology
 3554 . Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .	1	psychology
 In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .	1	psychology
 3557 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .	0	psychology
 These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .	1	psychology
 3560 . A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences .	0	psychology
 In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .	1	psychology
 In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 3563 . Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued .	1	psychology
 These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug .	0	psychology
 3566 . In recent years , methamphetamine ( meth ) use has become increasingly widespread .	0	psychology
 Methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available ( e.g. , medications containing pseudoephedrine , a compound found in many over - the - counter cold and flu remedies ) .	1	psychology
 Despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult , methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option ( Shukla , Crump , & Chrisco , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3569 . Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco ; therefore , there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques .	0	psychology
 To date , people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products .	0	psychology
 In general , smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term , but it is unclear whether these effects persist ( Cropley , Theadom , Pravettoni , & Webb , 2008 ; Levitt , Shaw , Wong , & Kaczorowski , 2007 ; Smedslund , Fisher , Boles , & Lichtenstein , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 3572 . Still , people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult .	0	psychology
 Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .	1	psychology
 Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .	0	psychology
 3575 . A hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual experiences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In some cases , users experience vivid visual hallucinations .	0	psychology
 3578 . Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli .	1	psychology
 When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor , sensation has occurred .	0	psychology
 For example , light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye .	0	psychology
 Under quiet conditions , the hair cells ( the receptor cells of the inner ear ) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away ( Galanter , 1962).It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness — these are called subliminal messages .	1	psychology
