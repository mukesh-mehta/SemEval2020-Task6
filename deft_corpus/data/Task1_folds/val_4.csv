 3581 . It has been estimated that on a clear night , the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away ( Okawa & Sampath , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain : This is an absolute threshold .	0	psychology
 3584 . Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .	0	psychology
 Bottom - up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input .	1	psychology
 On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .	0	psychology
 3587 . Because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball , they completely tuned out other visual information .	0	psychology

 2623 . The Taliban refused to turn bin Laden over , and the United States began a bombing campaign in October , allying with the Afghan Northern Alliance , a coalition of tribal leaders opposed to the Taliban .	1	history
 U.S. air support was soon augmented by ground troops ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2626 . First , it sought to hold schools accountable for raising standards and enabling students to meet them .	0	history
 The No Child Left Behind Act , signed into law in January 2002 , erected a system of testing to measure and ultimately improve student performance in reading and math at all schools that received federal funds ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Schools whose students performed poorly on the tests would be labeled “ in need of improvement . ” If poor performance continued , schools could face changes in curricula and teachers , or even the prospect of closure .	0	history
 2629 . By 2008 , credit card debt had risen to over $ 1 trillion .	0	history
 More importantly , banks were making high - risk , high - interest mortgage loans called subprime mortgages to consumers who often misunderstood their complex terms and lacked the ability to make the required payments .	1	history
 2632 . International trade slowed , hurting many American businesses .	0	history
 As the Great Recession of 2008 deepened , the situation of ordinary citizens became worse .	0	history
 During the last four months of 2008 , one million American workers lost their jobs , and during 2009 , another three million found themselves out of work .	0	history
 2635 . The act , which created the program known as Obamacare , represented the first significant overhaul of the American healthcare system since the passage of Medicaid in 1965 .	0	history
 Its goals were to provide all Americans with access to affordable health insurance , to require that everyone in the United States acquire some form of health insurance , and to lower the costs of healthcare .	1	history
 4222 . Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .	1	psychology
 Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream , or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal .	0	psychology
 4228 . These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .	1	psychology
 People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .	1	psychology
 For example , the person who claims to be Jesus Christ , or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years , or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions .	0	psychology
 4231 . Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .	1	psychology
 In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .	1	psychology
 4234 . Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings : drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms ( Howes & Kapur , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia ( Snyder , 1976 ) .	1	psychology
 More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways .	0	psychology
 4237 . Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions .	0	psychology
 A new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis , such as unusual thought content , paranoia , odd communication , delusions , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are coined prodromal symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder .	0	psychology
 A number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of psychosis ) , recent deterioration in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of suspicion or paranoia , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( Fusar - Poli et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4240 . The term personality refers loosely to one ’s stable , consistent , and distinctive way of thinking about , feeling , acting , and relating to the world .	1	psychology
 People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture , is pervasive and inflexible , begins in adolescence or early adulthood , and causes distress or impairment ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact .	0	psychology
 4243 . People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .	0	psychology
 Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and obsessive - compulsive personality disorder ( which is not the same thing as obsessive - compulsive disorder ) .	1	psychology
 People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful .	0	psychology
 4246 . Mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also mania and elation ( Rothschild , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states , and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives .	0	psychology
 4252 . These subtypes — what the DSM-5 refer to as specifiers — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present .	0	psychology
 One subtype , seasonal pattern , applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or winter ) .	1	psychology
 In everyday language , people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues .	0	psychology
 4255 . A person with bipolar disorder ( commonly known as manic depression ) often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to unipolar , which indicates a persistently sad mood ) .	1	psychology
 4258 . If so , what might such predispositions be ?	0	psychology
 A study by Caspi and others ( 2003 ) suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin ( the 5-HTTLPR gene ) might be one culprit .	0	psychology
 These investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions .	0	psychology
 4261 . This theory , which focuses on rumination in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1987 ) .	0	psychology
 Rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms , rather that distracting one ’s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1991 ) .	1	psychology
 When people ruminate , they have thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotivated ?	0	psychology
 4264 . Obsessive - compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive , unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors .	0	psychology
 Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , craving double cheeseburgers when dieting ) , and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion ( e.g. , pacing when nervous ) .	0	psychology
 4267 . Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing , cleaning , checking ( e.g. , that a door is locked ) , and ordering ( e.g. , lining up all the pencils in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as counting , praying , or reciting something to oneself ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Compulsions characteristic of OCD are not performed out of pleasure , nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event .	0	psychology
 4270 . A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex ( Kopell & Greenberg , 2008 ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( Rushworth , Noonan , Boorman , Walton , & Behrens , 2011 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In people with OCD , the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which , for example , they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall ( Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischkel , & Kathmann , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 4273 . SPECIFIC PHOBIAPhobia is a Greek word that means fear .	0	psychology
 A person diagnosed with a specific phobia ( formerly known as simple phobia ) experiences excessive , distressing , and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , enclosed spaces , elevators , or flying ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational , some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) .	0	psychology
 4276 . The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning , such as modeling .	0	psychology
 For example , a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears , even though spiders have never presented any danger to him .	0	psychology
 4279 . People with panic disorder experience recurrent ( more than one ) and unexpected panic attacks , along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks , worry over the consequences of the attacks , or self - defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .	0	psychology
 4282 . Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened ( Bouton , Mineka , & Barlow , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , consider a child who has asthma .	0	psychology
 4285 . For centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective : attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding .	1	psychology
 Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits ( [ link ] ) ( Maher & Maher , 1985 ) .	0	psychology
 4288 . The diathesis - stress model ( Zuckerman , 1999 ) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder .	0	psychology
 This diathesis - stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder ( i.e. , a diathesis ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood maltreatment , negative life events , trauma , and so on .	1	psychology
 4291 . Such feelings would be normal .	0	psychology
 If you felt extremely depressed — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or sleeping , felt utterly worthless , and contemplated suicide — your feelings would be atypical , would deviate from the norm , and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Just because something is atypical , however , does not necessarily mean it is disordered .	0	psychology
 4294 . Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 According to the APA ( 2013 ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following :	0	psychology
 4297 . The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity ; the co - occurrence of two disorders .	1	psychology
 For example , the DSM-5 mentions that 41 % of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4300 . Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on temperament , the inborn , genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter .	0	psychology
 They believed personality is largely governed by biology .	0	psychology
 4303 . The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .	1	psychology
 Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4306 . Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing .	0	psychology
 This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud — projection — as a way to assess unconscious processes .	1	psychology
 1 . What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines ?	0	biology
 Science ( from the Latin scientia , meaning “ knowledge ” ) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws , especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method .	1	biology
 It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science .	0	biology
 4 . A hypothesis may become a verified theory .	0	biology
 A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena .	1	biology
 Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe .	1	biology
 10 . A valid hypothesis must be testable .	0	biology
 It should also be falsifiable , meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results .	0	biology
 Importantly , science does not claim to “ prove ” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information .	0	biology
 13 . Basic science or “ pure ” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short - term application of that knowledge .	0	biology
 It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value .	0	biology
 16 . Instead , most scientists present their results in peer - reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals .	0	biology
 Peer - reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist ’s colleagues , or peers .	1	biology
 These colleagues are qualified individuals , often experts in the same research area , who judge whether or not the scientist ’s work is suitable for publication .	0	biology
 19 . The introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal .	0	biology
 Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism .	1	biology
 22 . The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .	0	biology
 In the discussion section , the researcher will interpret the results , describe how variables may be related , and attempt to explain the observations .	0	biology
 It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research .	0	biology
 25 . These conditions may , however , change from one moment to the next .	0	biology
 Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly , despite environmental changes , through homeostasis ( literally , “ steady state”)—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions .	1	biology
 For example , an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation .	0	biology
 28 . A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .	1	biology
 Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .	1	biology
 An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( [ link ] ) , which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms .	1	biology
 31 . Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic .	0	biology
 Prokaryotes are single - celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane - bound nuclei ; in contrast , the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane - bound organelles and a membrane - bound nucleus .	1	biology
 34 . Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .	0	biology
 An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs .	1	biology
 Mammals have many organ systems .	0	biology
 37 . For example , the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations .	0	biology
 A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area .	0	biology
 For instance , all of the trees , flowers , insects , and other populations in a forest form the forest ’s community .	0	biology
 40 . The fact that biology , as a science , has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth .	0	biology
 The source of this diversity is evolution , the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species .	0	biology
 Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems .	0	biology
 43 . For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .	0	biology
 Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .	0	biology
 It is quite a broad branch itself , and depending on the subject of study , there are also microbial physiologists , ecologists , and geneticists , among others .	0	biology
 46 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .	0	biology
 Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists , ecologists , or physiologists , to name just a few areas .	0	biology
 49 . To understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element , the atom .	0	biology
 An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element .	0	biology
 For example , one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature .	0	biology
 52 . Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .	0	biology
 Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit .	0	biology
 Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass .	0	biology
 55 . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number .	0	biology
 Since an element ’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes .	0	biology
 Often , the resulting number contains a fraction .	0	biology
 58 . The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table .	0	biology
 Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( 1834–1907 ) in 1869 , the table groups elements that , although unique , share certain chemical properties with other elements .	0	biology
 61 . An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr ( 1885–1962 ) .	0	biology
 The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons , with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 These orbits form electron shells or energy levels , which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells .	0	biology
 64 . Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration , while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable .	0	biology
 As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions .	0	biology
 Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions .	0	biology
 67 . This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable .	0	biology
 However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration .	0	biology
 When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other , the resultant chemical structure is a molecule .	0	biology
 70 . In the equation below , the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules .	0	biology
 This is an example of a balanced chemical equation , wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation .	1	biology
 According to the law of conservation of matter , the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal , such that no atoms are , under normal circumstances , created or destroyed .	1	biology
 73 . The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .	0	biology
 Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .	0	biology
 In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .	0	biology
 76 . Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons , each ion has a net charge .	0	biology
 Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons .	1	biology
 Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .	1	biology
 79 . Ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges .	1	biology
 For instance , positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride , or table salt , creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge .	0	biology
 82 . There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar .	0	biology
 In a polar covalent bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other .	1	biology
 Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ+ ) or slightly negative ( δ– ) charge develops .	0	biology
 85 . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule .	1	biology
 This interaction is called a hydrogen bond .	0	biology
 This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules .	0	biology
 88 . In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .	1	biology
 These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -phobic = “ fearing ” ) .	0	biology
 91 . Water also has a high heat of vaporization , the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas .	1	biology
 A considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 cal ) is required to accomplish this change in water .	0	biology
 94 . The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .	1	biology
 This is referred to as a sphere of hydration , or a hydration shell , as illustrated in [ link ] and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water . When ionic compounds are added to water , the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation .	0	biology
 Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions .	1	biology
 97 . These cohesive forces are related to water ’s property of adhesion , or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules .	1	biology
 This attraction is sometimes stronger than water ’s cohesive forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes .	0	biology
 100 . Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH .	0	biology
 An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .	1	biology
 A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH– ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .	1	biology
 103 . Buffers are the key .	0	biology
 Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH– , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival .	1	biology
 Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’s well - being .	0	biology
 106 . So far , the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons , which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 Another type of hydrocarbon , aromatic hydrocarbons , consists of closed rings of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 109 . Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .	1	biology
 Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	1	biology
 For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans . Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds .	1	biology
 112 . Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules .	1	biology
 They are found along the “ carbon backbone ” of macromolecules .	0	biology
 115 . Most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called monomers .	1	biology
 The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers .	1	biology
 118 . Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed , or “ sped up , ” by specific enzymes ; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds , requiring energy , while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy .	1	biology
 These reactions are similar for most macromolecules , but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class .	0	biology
 121 . Monosaccharides ( mono- = “ one ” ; sacchar- = “ sweet ” ) are simple sugars , the most common of which is glucose .	1	biology
 In monosaccharides , the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven .	0	biology
 124 . PolysaccharidesA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide ( poly- = “ many ” ) .	1	biology
 The chain may be branched or unbranched , and it may contain different types of monosaccharides .	0	biology
 127 . Arthropods ( insects , crustaceans , and others ) have an outer skeleton , called the exoskeleton , which protects their internal body parts ( as seen in the bee in [ link ] ) . This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin , which is a polysaccharide - containing nitrogen .	1	biology
 It is made of repeating units of N - acetyl - β - d - glucosamine , a modified sugar .	0	biology
 130 . Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .	0	biology
 For example , palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , is derived from the palm tree .	1	biology
 Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea , the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts .	1	biology
 133 . Consequently , they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet .	0	biology
 Omega-3 fatty acids ( like that shown in [ link ] ) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans ( the other being omega-6 fatty acid ) .	0	biology
 These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond .	0	biology
 136 . Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier , steroids have a fused ring structure .	0	biology
 Although they do not resemble the other lipids , they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water .	0	biology
 139 . Hormones are chemical - signaling molecules , usually small proteins or steroids , secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes , including growth , development , metabolism , and reproduction .	1	biology
 For example , insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level .	0	biology
 142 . The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein 's shape , size , and function .	0	biology
 Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond , known as a peptide bond , which is formed by a dehydration reaction .	1	biology
 The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine , releasing a molecule of water .	0	biology
 145 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .	0	biology
 The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds .	1	biology
 148 . It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process .	0	biology
 Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones ( or chaperonins ) that associate with the target protein during the folding process .	1	biology
 They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure , and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded .	0	biology
 151 . The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell .	1	biology
 This intermediary is the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .	0	biology
 Other types of RNA — like rRNA , tRNA , and microRNA — are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation .	0	biology
 154 . Adenine and guanine are classified as purines .	0	biology
 The primary structure of a purine is two carbon - nitrogen rings .	0	biology
 157 . In this way , the mRNA is read and the protein product is made .	0	biology
 Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds .	1	biology
 The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids .	0	biology
 160 . With few exceptions , individual cells can not be seen with the naked eye , so scientists use microscopes ( micro- = “ small ” ; -scope = “ to look at ” ) to study them .	0	biology
 A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object .	1	biology
 Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope , and these images can also be called micrographs . The optics of a microscope ’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees .	1	biology
 163 . By the late 1830s , botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory , which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells , the cell is the basic unit of life , and new cells arise from existing cells .	1	biology
 Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory .	0	biology
 166 . Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function , especially in cell biology , and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , rod - shaped chromosomes .	1	biology
 Because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” The word “ organelle ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions . At this point , it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells .	1	biology
 169 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .	1	biology
 It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water , it has a semi - solid consistency , which comes from the proteins within it .	0	biology
 172 . The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions , molecules , and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm .	1	biology
 The nucleoplasm is the semi - solid fluid inside the nucleus , where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus .	1	biology
 175 . Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA .	0	biology
 A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus ( plural = nucleoli ) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 178 . Peroxisomes are small , round organelles enclosed by single membranes .	1	biology
 They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids .	0	biology
 181 . Animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells : lysosomes .	0	biology
 The lysosomes are the cell ’s “ garbage disposal . ” In plant cells , the digestive processes take place in vacuoles .	1	biology
 Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins , polysaccharides , lipids , nucleic acids , and even worn - out organelles .	0	biology
 184 . The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll , which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis .	1	biology
 Like plant cells , photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts .	0	biology
 187 . MicrofilamentsOf the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton , microfilaments are the narrowest .	0	biology
 They function in cellular movement , have a diameter of about 7 nm , and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 190 . To refresh your memory , flagella ( singular = flagellum ) are long , hair - like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell ( for example , sperm , Euglena ) .	1	biology
 When present , the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella .	0	biology
 193 . Such transport uses the vascular tissues ( xylem and phloem ) primarily .	0	biology
 There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata ( singular = plasmodesma ) , numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells , connect their cytoplasm , and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell , and thus throughout the plant ( [ link]).A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells .	1	biology
 Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell .	0	biology
 196 . Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions , nutrients , and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Structurally , however , gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ .	0	biology
 199 . The main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic , phospholipid molecules .	0	biology
 The hydrophilic or “ water - loving ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of balls in an artist ’s rendition of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell .	1	biology
 Hydrophobic , or water - hating molecules , tend to be non - polar .	1	biology
 202 . Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes .	0	biology
 Integral proteins ( some specialized types are called integrins ) are , as their name suggests , integrated completely into the membrane structure , and their hydrophobic membrane - spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Single - pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids .	0	biology
 205 . The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive .	0	biology
 Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement .	1	biology
 In passive transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration .	0	biology
 208 . In filtration , material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane ; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure , causing the substances to filter more rapidly .	1	biology
 This occurs in the kidney , where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances , or solutes , out of the blood and into the renal tubules .	1	biology
 The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure .	0	biology
 211 . Channels are specific for the substance that is being transported .	0	biology
 Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids ; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell .	0	biology
 214 . Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane , which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes .	1	biology
 While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells , osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water .	0	biology
 217 . A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .	0	biology
 Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution .	1	biology
 A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles ; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles .	0	biology
 220 . In an isotonic solution , the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell .	1	biology
 If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid , there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell , although water will still move in and out .	0	biology
 223 . The electrical gradient of K+ , a positive ion , also tends to drive it into the cell , but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+ out of the cell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient .	1	biology
 226 . Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .	1	biology
 Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .	1	biology
 229 . A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	1	biology
 An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules , but in different directions .	1	biology
 232 . Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles , such as large molecules , parts of cells , and even whole cells , into a cell .	1	biology
 There are different variations of endocytosis , but all share a common characteristic : The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates , forming a pocket around the target particle .	0	biology
 235 . A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis .	0	biology
 This process uses a coating protein , called caveolin , on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , which performs a similar function to clathrin .	1	biology
 238 . The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis .	0	biology
 Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid .	1	biology
 Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane .	0	biology
 241 . Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones .	1	biology
 Synthesizing sugar from CO2 is one example .	0	biology
 244 . In most cases , this form is heat energy .	0	biology
 Thermodynamically , heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work .	1	biology
 For example , when an airplane flies through the air , some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air .	0	biology
 247 . If it is released , indeed it would do work .	0	biology
 Because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work , it is called potential energy .	0	biology
 Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way : As the wrecking ball hangs motionless , it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy .	0	biology
 250 . To calculate ∆G , subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy ( denoted as ∆S ) from the total energy change of the system .	0	biology
 This total energy change in the system is called enthalpy and is denoted as ∆H .	0	biology
 The formula for calculating ∆G is as follows , where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in Kelvin ( degrees Celsius + 273 ) :	0	biology
 253 . These reactions have a net release of energy , but still require some energy in the beginning .	1	biology
 This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy ( or free energy of activation ) and is abbreviated EA ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 256 . Within the cell , where does energy to power such reactions come from ?	0	biology
 The answer lies with an energy - supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate , or ATP .	0	biology
 ATP is a small , relatively simple molecule ( [ link ] ) , but within some of its bonds , it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work .	1	biology
 259 . Two reactants might also enter a reaction , both become modified , and leave the reaction as two products .	0	biology
 The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme ’s active site .	1	biology
 The active site is where the “ action ” happens , so to speak .	0	biology
 262 . In some cases of enzyme inhibition , for example , an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding .	0	biology
 When this happens , the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition , because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 On the other hand , in noncompetitive inhibition , an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site .	1	biology
 265 . In a most efficient and elegant way , cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity .	0	biology
 Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions .	0	biology
 268 . This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group , with its energy , to the substrate , a process called phosphorylation .	0	biology
 Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate ( ~P ) .	1	biology
 This is illustrated by the following generic reaction :	0	biology
 271 . Chemiosmosis , a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism , is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight .	1	biology
 The production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process .	1	biology
 274 . The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins , also known as glucose transporter proteins .	0	biology
 These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose . Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring - shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three - carbon sugar called pyruvate .	1	biology
 Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases .	0	biology
 277 . There , pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A ( CoA ) .	0	biology
 The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA .	0	biology
 CoA is made from vitamin B5 , pantothenic acid .	0	biology
 280 . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( [ link ] ) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids .	1	biology
 However , these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER : the rough ER and the smooth ER , respectively .	0	biology
 283 . Before reaching their final destination , the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted , packaged , and tagged so that they wind up in the right place .	0	biology
 Sorting , tagging , packaging , and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus ( also called the Golgi body ) , a series of flattened membranes ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 286 . Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism .	0	biology
 Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues .	0	biology
 289 . The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago . Plants , algae , and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Because they use light to manufacture their own food , they are called photoautotrophs ( literally , “ self - feeders using light ” ) .	1	biology
 Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs .	0	biology
 292 . In plants , photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves , which consist of several layers of cells .	0	biology
 The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll .	1	biology
 The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance .	0	biology
 295 . Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope ( composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane ) .	0	biology
 Within the chloroplast are stacked , disc - shaped structures called thylakoids .	0	biology
 Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain .	1	biology
 298 . The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen .	0	biology
 As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis).Art Connection	1	biology
 3616 . Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .	1	psychology
 One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .	1	psychology
 To experience this slightly different view , do this simple exercise : extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger .	0	psychology
 3625 . The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies .	1	psychology
 More specifically , the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies .	0	psychology
 3628 . If a sound comes from an off - center location , it creates two types of binaural cues : interaural level differences and interaural timing differences .	0	psychology
 Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .	1	psychology
 Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3631 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .	1	psychology
 Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .	1	psychology
 Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age , genetic predisposition , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme noise ( noise - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain illnesses ( such as measles or mumps ) , or damage due to toxins ( such as those found in certain solvents and metals ) .	0	psychology
 3634 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .	1	psychology
 One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3637 . In the United States and other places around the world , deaf people have their own language , schools , and customs .	1	psychology
 This is called deaf culture .	0	psychology
 In the United States , deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language ( ASL ) ; ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures .	1	psychology
 3640 . Umami is our fifth taste .	0	psychology
 Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy , and it is associated with a taste for monosodium glutamate ( Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch , 2009 ) .	1	psychology
 There is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food ( Mizushige , Inoue , & Fushiki , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 3643 . Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor , chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb : a bulb - like structure at the tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin .	1	psychology
 From the olfactory bulb , information is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex , which is located very near the gustatory cortex ( Lodovichi & Belluscio , 2012 ; Spors et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3646 . Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .	1	psychology
 Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .	0	psychology
 3649 . As a result , pain signals that are sent to the brain get exaggerated .	1	psychology
 This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain .	0	psychology
 Multiple treatment options for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation .	0	psychology
 3658 . The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3661 . In this chapter , you have learned that perception is a complex process .	0	psychology
 Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .	0	psychology
 3667 . Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell ?	0	psychology
 Even if you are new to the study of psychology , chances are that you have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs .	0	psychology
 3670 . In Pavlov ’s experiments , the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them .	0	psychology
 The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .	1	psychology
 The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .	1	psychology
 3679 . When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger ’s food again , Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food — she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound .	0	psychology
 The behavior of Pavlov ’s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery : the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period ( [ link]).This is the curve of acquisition , extinction , and spontaneous recovery .	1	psychology
 The rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus ( acquisition ) .	0	psychology
 3682 . But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound , and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound , she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds ( provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart).Sometimes , classical conditioning can lead to habituation .	0	psychology
 Habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change .	1	psychology
 As the stimulus occurs over and over , we learn not to focus our attention on it .	0	psychology
 3685 . Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited , and it does n’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike .	1	psychology
 He proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about .	0	psychology
 3688 . The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement .	0	psychology
 In positive reinforcement , a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior .	1	psychology
 3691 . In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .	0	psychology
 In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .	1	psychology
 An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class .	0	psychology
 3694 . How about Joaquin , the soccer player ?	0	psychology
 If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary reinforcer .	0	psychology
 Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities .	1	psychology
 3697 . Watch this video clip where veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shapes a dog ’s behavior using the steps outlined above . Once a behavior is trained , researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement .	0	psychology
 In partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement , the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior .	1	psychology
 There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3700 . With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded .	0	psychology
 Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store , and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses .	0	psychology
 3703 . He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 As the unreinforced rats explored the maze , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 3706 . In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a mirror neuron ( Hickock , 2010 ; Rizzolatti , Fadiga , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2002 ; Rizzolatti , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 3709 . If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior , you will be more motivated to copy her .	1	psychology
 This is known as vicarious reinforcement .	0	psychology
 On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .	0	psychology
 3712 . This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .	0	psychology
 Simply put , cognition is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .	1	psychology
 Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3715 . Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .	0	psychology
 A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .	1	psychology
 For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .	0	psychology
 3718 . A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts ( Bartlett , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 There are many different types of schemata , and they all have one thing in common : schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently .	0	psychology
 3721 . Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another .	1	psychology
 While language is a form of communication , not all communication is language .	0	psychology
 3724 . Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language .	0	psychology
 A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .	1	psychology
 Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .	1	psychology
 3727 . Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3730 . Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules .	0	psychology
 This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization .	0	psychology
 In this context , overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule .	1	psychology
 3733 . Another type of strategy is an algorithm .	0	psychology
 An algorithm is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed .	0	psychology
 3736 . The person is stuck — but she just needs to go to another doorway , instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway .	0	psychology
 A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now .	1	psychology
 3739 . An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 3742 . Finally , the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that readily available to you , even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision .	1	psychology
 Biases tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our preexisting knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and hypotheses ” ( Aronson , 1995 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 These biases are summarized in [ link ] .	0	psychology
 3748 . Interestingly , drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage .	1	psychology
 A habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage .	1	psychology
 Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future ( Graham & Weiner , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 3757 . Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations .	0	psychology
 Sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze , evaluate , judge , compare , and contrast .	1	psychology
 3760 . Gardner ’s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence .	0	psychology
 Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others , show empathy , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways ( Parker , Saklofske , & Stough , 2009 ) .	1	psychology
 People with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills .	0	psychology
 3766 . As blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating ( Drazen & Woods , 2003 ; Druce , Small , & Bloom , 2004 ; Greary , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 The food ’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain ( Woods , 2004 ) , and fat cells release leptin , a satiety hormone .	1	psychology
 3769 . This observation led some to propose a set - point theory of body weight regulation .	0	psychology
 The set - point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is resistant to change .	1	psychology
 This set - point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure ( Speakman et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3772 . People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	0	psychology
 Morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI over 40 .	1	psychology
 Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the CDC , and other groups , its value as an assessment tool has been questioned .	0	psychology
 3775 . People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed .	1	psychology
 Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors .	0	psychology
 3778 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	1	psychology
 Like bulimia nervosa , anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , amenorrhea ( cessation of the menstrual period ) , reduced function of the gonads , and in extreme cases , death .	0	psychology
 3781 . MASTERS AND JOHNSON ’S RESEARCHIn 1966 , William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior .	0	psychology
 Unlike Kinsey , who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data , Masters and Johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions , and they observed people masturbating , manually or with the aid of a device .	0	psychology
 3784 . The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	0	psychology
 Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 3787 . While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm .	1	psychology
 In men , the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day .	0	psychology
 3790 . This involves dressing in opposite - sex clothing and assuming an opposite - sex identity .	0	psychology
 These individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 While these may sound like drastic changes , gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature , and they seek to correct this mistake .	0	psychology
 3793 . Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 The resulting data provide norms , or referential scores , by which to interpret future scores .	0	psychology
 3796 . The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100 .	0	psychology
 Standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets .	1	psychology
 The bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3799 . Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup .	1	psychology
 According to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience , especially in childhood .	0	psychology
 3802 . As we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions .	0	psychology
 An emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings .	1	psychology
 The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably , but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things .	0	psychology
 3808 . The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone .	0	psychology
 A polygraph , or lie detector test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions .	1	psychology
 Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers .	0	psychology
 3811 . AmygdalaThe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( Blackford & Pine , 2012 ; Goosens & Maren , 2002 ; Maren , Phan , & Liberzon , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3817 . Or does being happy make you smile ?	0	psychology
 The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions , meaning that smiling can make you feel happier ( Buck , 1980 ; Soussignan , 2001 ; Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 Recent research explored how Botox , which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion .	1	psychology
 3820 . Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids ( “ humors ” ) of the body : choleric temperament ( yellow bile from the liver ) , melancholic temperament ( black bile from the kidneys ) , sanguine temperament ( red blood from the heart ) , and phlegmatic temperament ( white phlegm from the lungs ) ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Eysenck & Eysenck , 1985 ; Lecci & Magnavita , 2013 ; Noga , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 Centuries later , the influential Greek physician and philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates ’s theory , suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments .	1	psychology
 For example , the choleric person is passionate , ambitious , and bold ; the melancholic person is reserved , anxious , and unhappy ; the sanguine person is joyful , eager , and optimistic ; and the phlegmatic person is calm , reliable , and thoughtful ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 3829 . When certain events , feelings , or yearnings cause an individual anxiety , the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety .	0	psychology
 To do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety .	1	psychology
 The ego , usually conscious , resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety .	1	psychology
 3835 . In each psychosexual stage of development , the child ’s pleasure - seeking urges , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone .	0	psychology
 The stages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital ( [ link]).Freud ’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial .	0	psychology
 3838 . Freud ’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage ( 3–6 years ) , corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls .	1	psychology
 The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals .	0	psychology
 3841 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 3844 . As an art school dropout with an uncertain future , young Erik Erikson met Freud ’s daughter , Anna Freud , while he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna .	0	psychology
 It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis .	0	psychology
 3847 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) .	1	psychology
 These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as facing death , becoming independent , and striving for mastery .	0	psychology
 3850 . We get information into our brains through a process called encoding , which is the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Once we receive sensory information from the environment , our brains label or code it .	0	psychology
 3856 . Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage .	0	psychology
 Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .	1	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 3865 . ( Note : Sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably .	0	psychology
 ) Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness .	1	psychology
 They are memories formed from behaviors .	0	psychology
 3868 . Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language .	1	psychology
 An example would be the question “ what does argumentative mean ? ” Stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts .	0	psychology
 For example , answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory :	0	psychology
 3871 . Very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only 12 known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( Parker , Cahill & McGaugh 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 And although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence , two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays .	0	psychology
 3874 . For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again .	1	psychology
 It involves a process of comparison .	0	psychology
 3880 . Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories , you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories ( procedural memory , motor learning , and classical conditioning ) , thanks to your cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 For example , one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air .	0	psychology
 3889 . Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .	1	psychology
 Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .	1	psychology
 3892 . AMNESIAAmnesia is the loss of long - term memory that occurs as the result of disease , physical trauma , or psychological trauma .	1	psychology
 Psychologist Tulving ( 2002 ) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. for years .	0	psychology
 3895 . The formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction , and the process of bringing up old memories is called reconstruction .	1	psychology
 Yet as we retrieve our memories , we also tend to alter and modify them .	0	psychology
 3898 . Contrast the Cotton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smart case .	0	psychology
 When Elizabeth was 14 years old and fast asleep in her bed at home , she was abducted at knifepoint .	0	psychology
 3901 . “ I ’ve a grand memory for forgetting , ” quipped Robert Louis Stevenson .	0	psychology
 Forgetting refers to loss of information from long - term memory .	1	psychology
 We all forget things , like a loved one ’s birthday , someone ’s name , or where we put our car keys .	0	psychology
 3904 . You probably answered yes to at least one , if not all , of these examples — but do n’t worry , you are not alone .	0	psychology
 We are all prone to committing the memory error known as absentmindedness .	0	psychology
 These lapses in memory are caused by breaks in attention or our focus being somewhere else . Cynthia , a psychologist , recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness .	1	psychology
 3907 . How about a memory of a traumatic event , something you really do not want to think about ?	0	psychology
 When you keep remembering something , to the point where you ca n’t “ get it out of your head ” and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things , it is called persistence .	1	psychology
 It ’s Schacter ’s seventh and last memory error .	0	psychology
 3910 . As the “ third force ” in psychology , humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of psychoanalysis , with its emphasis on psychological disturbance , and to the behaviorists’ view of humans passively reacting to the environment , which has been criticized as making people out to be personality - less robots .	1	psychology
 It does not suggest that psychoanalytic , behaviorist , and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience , and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self - directed change and transforming personal experiences .	0	psychology
 3913 . Rogers further divided the self into two categories : the ideal self and the real self .	0	psychology
 The ideal self is the person that you would like to be ; the real self is the person you actually are .	1	psychology
 Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .	0	psychology

 6123 . Furthermore , the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car ( [ link ] ) , or to search people entering the United States from another country . See , for example , Arizona v. Gant , 556 U.S. 332 ( 2009 ) .	0	government
 When a warrant is needed , law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction , but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found .	1	government
 Probable cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed ; it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof at a criminal trial .	0	government
 6126 . Many of the provisions dealing with the rights of the accused are included in the Fifth Amendment ; accordingly , it is one of the longest in the Bill of Rights .	0	government
 The Fifth Amendment states in full :	0	government

 This provision is so well known that we have a phrase for it : “ taking the Fifth . ” People have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might constitute an admission of guilt or responsibility for a crime .	0	government
 6132 . The greatest recent controversy over economic liberty has been sparked by cities’ and states’ use of the power of eminent domain to take property for redevelopment .	0	government
 Traditionally , the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads , highways , canals and reservoirs , and pipelines , which require fairly straight routes to be efficient .	0	government
 6135 . Most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial .	0	government
 This choice is typically the result of a plea bargain , an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge(s ) in question , or perhaps to less serious charges , in exchange for more lenient punishment than he or she might receive if convicted after a full trial .	1	government
 There are a number of reasons why this might happen .	0	government

 6147 . Although several state constitutions do list the right to privacy as a protected right , the explicit recognition by the Supreme Court of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century .	0	government
 In 1965 , the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v. Connecticut , a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception . Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and communications .	1	government
 Both these senses of privacy are examined below .	0	government
 6150 . Beyond the issues of contraception and abortion , the right to privacy has been interpreted to encompass a more general right for adults to have noncommercial , consensual sexual relationships in private .	0	government
 However , this legal development is relatively new ; as recently as 1986 , the Supreme Court ruled that states could still criminalize sex acts between two people of the same sex . Bowers v. Hardwick , 478 U.S. 186 ( 1986 ) .	1	government
 That decision was overturned in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas , which invalidated state laws that criminalized sodomy . Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558 ( 2003 ) .	1	government
 6153 . The proclamation that “ all men are created equal ” appears in the Declaration of Independence , and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that the federal government treat people equally .	0	government
 According to Chief Justice Earl Warren in the Supreme Court case of Bolling v. Sharpe ( 1954 ) , “ discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.”Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 ( 1954 ) .	0	government

 The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) and again in Clark v. Jeter ( 1988).Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .	0	government
 It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .	1	government
 6162 . Clearly , then , new civil rights issues can emerge over time .	0	government
 How can we , as citizens , identify them as they emerge and distinguish genuine claims of discrimination from claims by those who have merely been unable to convince a majority to agree with their viewpoints ?	0	government

Shelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1 ( 1948 ) .	1	government
 Because state courts are government institutions and the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government from denying people equal protection of the law , the courts’ enforcement of such covenants would be a violation of the amendment .	0	government
 Thus , if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller , the court would not hear the case .	0	government

Because affirmative action attempts to redress discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity , it is generally subject to the strict scrutiny standard , which means the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate the necessity of racial discrimination to achieve a compelling governmental interest .	0	government

 In 2003 , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Bakke decision in Grutter v.

 3028 . Integral calculus is needed to sum the field for an arbitrary shape current .	1	physics
 This results in a more complete law , called Ampere ’s law , which relates magnetic field and current in a general way .	1	physics
 Ampere ’s law in turn is a part of Maxwell ’s equations , which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena .	1	physics
 3031 . A solenoid is a long coil of wire ( with many turns or loops , as opposed to a flat loop ) .	1	physics

 3034 . It non - invasively produces two - dimensional and three - dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with none of the hazards of x - rays .	0	physics
 MRI is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) in which an externally applied magnetic field interacts with the nuclei of certain atoms , particularly those of hydrogen ( protons ) .	1	physics
 These nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields , similar to those of electrons and the current loops discussed earlier in this chapter . When placed in an external magnetic field , such nuclei experience a torque that pushes or aligns the nuclei into one of two new energy states — depending on the orientation of its spin ( analogous to the N pole and S pole in a bar magnet ) .	0	physics

 If motional emf can cause a current loop in the conductor , we refer to that current as an eddy current .	1	physics
 Eddy currents can produce significant drag , called magnetic damping , on the motion involved .	0	physics

 3055 . The beauty of a coral reef , the warm radiance of sunshine , the sting of sunburn , the X - ray revealing a broken bone , even microwave popcorn — all are brought to us by electromagnetic waves .	0	physics
 The list of the various types of electromagnetic waves , ranging from radio transmission waves to nuclear gamma - ray ( γγ size 12{g } { } -ray ) emissions , is interesting in itself .	0	physics
 3058 . Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges .	1	physics
 The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge , and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant ε0ε0 size 12{ε rSub { size 8{0 } } } { } , also known as the permittivity of free space .	1	physics
 3061 . As the process continues , the charge separation reverses and the field reaches its maximum downward value , returns to zero , and rises to its maximum upward value at the end of one complete cycle .	0	physics
 The outgoing wave has an amplitude proportional to the maximum separation of charge .	0	physics
 Its wavelengthλλ size 12 { left ( λ right ) } { } is proportional to the period of the oscillation and , hence , is smaller for short periods or high frequencies .	0	physics
 3064 . The dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves .	0	physics
 This is a resonant phenomenon and when we tune radios or TV , we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna .	0	physics
 3067 . AM radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range from 540 to 1600 kHz .	1	physics
 The abbreviation AM stands for amplitude modulation , which is the method for placing information on these waves .	1	physics
 ( See [ link ] . )	0	physics
 3070 . Television is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves .	0	physics
 Since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information , each channel requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission .	0	physics

 Electronic transitions in atoms and molecules can also produce infrared radiation .	0	physics
 3088 . This is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular , and it is independent of the angle of incidence .	0	physics
 Such an object , shown in [ link ] , is called a corner reflector , since the light bounces from its inside corner .	1	physics
 Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles , cars , and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originated .	0	physics
 3091 . Due to the lens ’s shape , light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces .	0	physics
 The point at which the rays cross is defined to be the focal point F of the lens .	1	physics
 The distance from the center of the lens to its focal point is defined to be the focal lengthff size 12{f } { } of the lens .	1	physics
 3094 . While ray tracing for complicated lenses , such as those found in sophisticated cameras , may require computer techniques , there is a set of simple rules for tracing rays through thin lenses .	0	physics
 A thin lens is defined to be one whose thickness allows rays to refract , as illustrated in [ link ] , but does not allow properties such as dispersion and aberrations .	1	physics
 An ideal thin lens has two refracting surfaces but the lens is thin enough to assume that light rays bend only once .	0	physics
 3097 . The eye manages this by varying the power ( and focal length ) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances .	0	physics
 The process of adjusting the eye ’s focal length is called accommodation .	1	physics
 A person with normal ( ideal ) vision can see objects clearly at distances ranging from 25 cm to essentially infinity .	0	physics
 3100 . More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear image .	0	physics
 The distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye ( normally infinity ) .	1	physics
 Farsightedness , or hyperopia , is the inability to see close objects clearly while distant objects may be clear .	1	physics
 3103 . Another common vision defect is astigmatism , an unevenness or asymmetry in the focus of the eye .	1	physics
 For example , rays passing through a vertical region of the eye may focus closer than rays passing through a horizontal region , resulting in the image appearing elongated .	0	physics
 3106 . This is true to an extent , but we find that color perception is even subtler than our eye ’s response for various wavelengths of light .	0	physics
 The two major types of light - sensing cells ( photoreceptors ) in the retina are rods and cones .	1	physics
 Rods are more sensitive than cones by a factor of about 1000 and are solely responsible for peripheral vision as well as vision in very dark environments .	0	physics
 3109 . One theory that takes various factors into account was advanced by Edwin Land ( 1909 – 1991 ) , the creative founder of the Polaroid Corporation .	0	physics
 Land proposed , based partly on his many elegant experiments , that the three types of cones are organized into systems called retinexes .	1	physics
 Each retinex forms an image that is compared with the others , and the eye - brain system thus can compare a candle - illuminated white table cloth with its generally reddish surroundings and determine that it is actually white .	1	physics
 3115 . If we pass light through smaller openings , often called slits , we can use Huygens ’s principle to see that light bends as sound does ( see [ link ] ) .	0	physics
 The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction .	1	physics

 3121 . The brightest colors are those that interfere constructively .	0	physics
 This interference is between light reflected from different surfaces of a thin film ; thus , the effect is known as thin film interference .	0	physics
 As noticed before , interference effects are most prominent when light interacts with something having a size similar to its wavelength .	0	physics
 3124 . Waves having such a direction are said to be polarized .	0	physics
 For an EM wave , we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field .	1	physics
 Thus we can think of the electric field arrows as showing the direction of polarization , as in [ link].An EM wave , such as light , is a transverse wave .	0	physics
 3127 . The Sun and many other light sources produce waves that are randomly polarized ( see [ link ] ) .	1	physics
 Such light is said to be unpolarized because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization .	0	physics
 Polaroid materials , invented by the founder of Polaroid Corporation , Edwin Land , act as a polarizing slit for light , allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through .	1	physics
 3130 . Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two .	1	physics
 Such crystals are said to be birefringent ( see [ link ] ) .	0	physics
 Each of the separated rays has a specific polarization .	0	physics
 3133 . An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force .	1	physics
 3136 . It was not until 1905 , when Einstein published his first paper on special relativity , that the currently accepted conclusion was reached .	0	physics
 Based mostly on his analysis that the laws of electricity and magnetism would not allow another speed for light , and only slightly aware of the Michelson - Morley experiment , Einstein detailed his second postulate of special relativity . Second Postulate of Special Relativity	0	physics
 3139 . An observer of electromagnetic radiation sees relativistic Doppler effects if the source of the radiation is moving relative to the observer .	0	physics
 The wavelength of the radiation is longer ( called a red shift ) than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and shorter ( called a blue shift ) when the source moves toward the observer .	0	physics
 3145 . The type of gas and its temperature , for example , could be determined .	0	physics
 We now know that these EM emissions come from electrons transitioning between energy levels in individual atoms and molecules ; thus , they are called atomic spectra .	1	physics
 Atomic spectra remain an important analytical tool today .	0	physics
 3151 . They are akin to lines in atomic spectra , implying the energy levels of atoms are quantized .	0	physics
 Phenomena such as discrete atomic spectra and characteristic x rays are explored further in Atomic Physics . Ultraviolet radiation ( approximately 4 eV to 300 eV ) overlaps with the low end of the energy range of x rays , but UV is typically lower in energy .	0	physics
 UV comes from the de - excitation of atoms that may be part of a hot solid or gas .	1	physics
 3154 . Not all molecules have this property .	0	physics
 Air , for example , is nearly transparent to many IR frequencies . Microwaves are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic circuits , although they are also produced naturally .	1	physics
 Thus microwaves are similar to IR but do not extend to as high frequencies .	0	physics

 This is defined to be the de Broglie wavelength .	0	physics
 ( Note that we already have this for photons , from the equation p = h / λp = h / λ size 12{p = h / λ } { } . )	0	physics
 3160 . Particle - wave duality — the fact that all particles have wave properties — is one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics .	1	physics
 We first came across it in the treatment of photons , those particles of EM radiation that exhibit both particle and wave properties , but not at the same time .	1	physics
 3163 . The English scientist William Crookes , among others , continued to study what for some time were called Crookes tubes , wherein electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the rarefied gas inside the tube and are accelerated from the cathode ( negative ) to the anode ( positive ) by the high potential .	1	physics
 These “ cathode rays ” collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them , resulting in the emission of electromagnetic ( EM ) radiation that makes the electrons’ path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode . Gas discharge tubes today are most commonly called cathode - ray tubes , because the rays originate at the cathode .	1	physics
 Crookes showed that the electrons carry momentum ( they can make a small paddle wheel rotate ) .	0	physics

 and only one electron , that atom is called a hydrogen - like atom .	0	physics
 The spectra of hydrogen - like ions are similar to hydrogen , but shifted to higher energy by the greater attractive force between the electron and nucleus .	0	physics
 3172 . Each type of atom ( or element ) has its own characteristic electromagnetic spectrum .	0	physics
 X rays lie at the high - frequency end of an atom ’s spectrum and are characteristic of the atom as well .	0	physics
 In this section , we explore characteristic x rays and some of their important applications . We have previously discussed x rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum in Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum .	0	physics
 3175 . Once it is excited , the atom can de - excite in several ways , one of which is to re - emit a photon of the same energy as excited it , a single step back to the ground state .	1	physics
 This is called atomic de - excitation .	0	physics
 All other paths of de - excitation involve smaller steps , in which lower - energy ( longer wavelength ) photons are emitted .	0	physics
 3178 . Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms , they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and , thus , are said to be metastable , meaning relatively stable .	0	physics
 Phosphorescence is the de - excitation of a metastable state .	1	physics
 Glow - in - the - dark materials , such as luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children ’s toys and pajamas , are made of phosphorescent substances .	0	physics
 3181 . The name laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation , the process just described .	1	physics
 The process was proposed and developed following the advances in quantum physics .	0	physics
 3184 . In order to explore the substructure of atoms ( and knowing that magnetic fields affect moving charges ) , the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz ( 1853–1930 ) suggested that his student Pieter Zeeman ( 1865–1943 ) study how spectra might be affected by magnetic fields .	0	physics
 What they found became known as the Zeeman effect , which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field , as shown in [ link ] .	1	physics
 For their discoveries , Zeeman and Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics .	0	physics
 3187 . Physical characteristics that are quantized — such as energy , charge , and angular momentum — are of such importance that names and symbols are given to them .	0	physics
 The values of quantized entities are expressed in terms of quantum numbers , and the rules governing them are of the utmost importance in determining what nature is and does .	0	physics
 This section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and rules — all of which apply in chemistry , material science , and far beyond the realm of atomic physics , where they were first discovered .	0	physics
 3190 . The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity .	0	physics
 The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .	0	physics
 A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) .	1	physics
 3193 . Apart from αα size 12{α } { } , ββ size 12{β } { } , and γγ size 12{γ } { } , there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well , and these also produce ionization with similar effects .	0	physics
 We define ionizing radiation as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not , since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization . These dosimeters ( literally , dose meters ) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor .	1	physics
 The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered , a measurement of dose .	0	physics
 3196 . The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce , such as the phosphor used by Rutherford ’s group .	0	physics
 Materials called scintillators use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light .	0	physics
 Scintillators may be liquid or solid , and they can be very efficient .	0	physics
 3199 . We have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei .	1	physics
 However , there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei — the proton and the neutron , referred to collectively as nucleons , the constituents of nuclei .	1	physics
 3202 . Decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability .	0	physics
 There are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons , called magic numbers .	0	physics
 Magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed shells are more stable .	1	physics
 3205 . There are actually three types of beta decay .	0	physics
 The first discovered was “ ordinary ” beta decay and is called β−β− size 12{β rSup { size 8 { - { } } } } { } decay or electron emission .	0	physics
 3208 . Antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons , being nearly identical , having the same mass , spin , and so on , but having a positive charge and an electron family number of –1–1 .	1	physics
 When a positron encounters an electron , there is a mutual annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectron - electron pair is converted into pure photon energy .	0	physics
 ( The reaction , e++e−→γ+γe++e−→γ+γ size 12{e rSup { size 8{+ { } } } + e rSup { size 8{- { } } } rightarrow g+g } { } , conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved quantities . )	0	physics

 For an arbitrary time , not just a multiple of the half - life , the exponential relationship must be used . Radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity .	0	physics
 Its most famous application is carbon-14 dating .	0	physics
 3214 . We can therefore learn about nuclear forces by examining how tightly bound the nuclei are .	0	physics
 We define the binding energy ( BE ) of a nucleus to be the energy required to completely disassemble it into separate protons and neutrons .	1	physics
 We can determine the BE of a nucleus from its rest mass .	0	physics
 3217 . Second , nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in , so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes .	1	physics
 The compound is said to be tagged .	0	physics
 A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical .	1	physics
 608 . In shotgun sequencing method , several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces ( somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun ) .	1	biology
 All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain - sequencing method .	0	biology
 614 . DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences .	1	biology
 Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays , whereas whole - genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome .	0	biology
 617 . Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics .	0	biology
 Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .	1	biology
 The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .	1	biology
 620 . Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer ; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process .	1	biology
 An individual protein is called a biomarker , whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature .	0	biology
 For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as sweat , blood , or urine , such that large - scale screenings can be performed in a non - invasive fashion .	0	biology
 626 . Darwin called this mechanism natural selection .	0	biology
 Natural selection , also known as “ survival of the fittest , ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change .	1	biology
 629 . Sometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other .	0	biology
 When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point , it is called divergent evolution .	1	biology
 Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ( [ link]).Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor .	0	biology
 632 . Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all , and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor .	1	biology
 These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures .	0	biology
 Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds , leaves on some cacti , and hind leg bones in whales .	0	biology
 638 . For example , even though bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) and African fish eagles ( Haliaeetus vocifer ) are both birds and eagles , each belongs to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch , that offspring , called a hybrid ( a cross between two species ) , would probably be infertile — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity .	1	biology
 Different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions .	0	biology
" 641 . Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution ."	1	biology
" Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location ."	1	biology
 644 . Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed .	1	biology
 In some cases , a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The prefix “ auto- ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species .	1	biology
 647 . Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually .	1	biology
 Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .	1	biology
 A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .	0	biology
 650 . In some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species .	1	biology
 This situation is called habitat isolation .	0	biology
 Reproduction with the parent species ceases , and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent .	0	biology
 653 . Hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages .	1	biology
 This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable .	0	biology
 In another postzygotic situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called hybrid sterility .	1	biology
 662 . Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences , or genetic variance , among individuals in a population .	1	biology
 The greater the hereditability of a population ’s phenotypic variation , the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation .	0	biology
 665 . While it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool .	0	biology
 However , if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other , this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring , a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression .	1	biology
 668 . Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events , such as a natural disaster that kills — at random — a large portion of the population .	0	biology
 Known as the bottleneck effect , it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In one fell swoop , the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - disaster population .	0	biology
 671 . Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection .	0	biology
 One common form of mate choice , called assortative mating , is an individual ’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves .	1	biology
 674 . Natural selection only acts on the population ’s heritable traits : selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution .	1	biology
 Natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms .	0	biology
 677 . If natural selection favors an average phenotype , selecting against extreme variation , the population will undergo stabilizing selection ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In a population of mice that live in the woods , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators .	0	biology
 680 . Another type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , favors phenotypes that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) .	1	biology
 An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest .	0	biology
 683 . The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease .	1	biology
 Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority , which they will then pass on to their offspring .	0	biology
 686 . Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms .	0	biology
 A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms .	1	biology
 Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships .	0	biology
 689 . The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .	1	biology
 A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 692 . Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these disciplines together contribute to building , updating , and maintaining the “ tree of life . ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics .	0	biology
 Data may be collected from fossils , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by DNA analysis .	0	biology
 695 . Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .	1	biology
 After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 698 . This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions .	0	biology
 When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an analogy or homoplasy .	1	biology
 For example , insects use wings to fly like bats and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different .	0	biology
 704 . To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately , scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony , which means that events occurred in the simplest , most obvious way .	1	biology
 For example , if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking , based on the principle of maximum parsimony , one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones .	0	biology
 710 . The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .	1	biology
 All of these hypotheses are testable .	0	biology

 722 . Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .	0	biology
 Group II viruses have single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as their genome .	1	biology
 They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .	0	biology
 725 . Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .	1	biology
 Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .	1	biology
 Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .	1	biology
 728 . Additionally , full - length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative - stranded genome .	0	biology
 Group VI viruses have diploid ( two copies ) ssRNA genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse transcriptase , to dsDNA ; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .	1	biology
 731 . The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage .	1	biology
 These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .	0	biology
 Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .	1	biology
 737 . When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	1	biology
 If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4 , which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract .	0	biology
 740 . An example is the animal herpesviruses , including herpes simplex viruses , the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans .	0	biology
 In a process called latency , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions , only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates .	1	biology
 Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency , the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages .	0	biology
 743 . Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .	0	biology
 Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .	0	biology
 Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .	1	biology
 746 . Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s sap , by living organisms such as insects and nematodes , and through pollen .	1	biology
 When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 752 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .	0	biology
 Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .	1	biology
 Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host .	0	biology
 755 . The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them .	0	biology
 Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic - resistant bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries .	0	biology
 However , the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria .	0	biology
 As more and more antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria evolve , the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide .	0	biology
 758 . It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle .	0	biology
 PrP exists in two forms , PrPc , the normal form of the protein , and PrPsc , the infectious form .	0	biology
 Once introduced into the body , the PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc .	0	biology
 761 . Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth ; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago .	0	biology
 A microbial mat is a multi - layered sheet of prokaryotes ( [ link ] ) that includes mostly bacteria , but also archaea .	1	biology
 Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick , and they typically grow where different types of materials interface , mostly on moist surfaces .	0	biology
 767 . Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .	0	biology
 Cyanobacteria ( [ link ] ) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere .	1	biology
 770 . In other cases , culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions , even though the same organism could be cultured previously .	0	biology
 Those organisms that can not be cultured but are not dead are in a viable - but - non - culturable ( VBNC ) state .	1	biology
 The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival .	0	biology
 773 . The cell wall functions as a protective layer , and it is responsible for the organism ’s shape .	1	biology
 Some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall .	0	biology
 Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species , but not in others ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 776 . There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan .	0	biology
 S - layer ( surface layer ) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria .	1	biology
 779 . There are four different types of Archaean cell walls .	0	biology
 One type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan , which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain .	1	biology
 The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides , glycoproteins , or pure protein .	0	biology
 788 . Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .	1	biology
 Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .	1	biology
 Ammonia released to the atmosphere , however , represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released ; the rest is as N2 and N2O .	0	biology
 791 . Epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population .	1	biology
 An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .	1	biology
 A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 794 . One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death ( 1346 to 1361 ) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .	0	biology
 It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread along the Silk Road , a network of land and sea trade routes , to the Mediterranean region and Europe , carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships .	0	biology
 797 . The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning “ against ” and bios meaning “ life . ” An antibiotic is a chemical , produced either by microbes or synthetically , that is hostile to the growth of other organisms .	1	biology
 Today ’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis .	0	biology
 800 . Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common .	0	biology
 A foodborne disease ( colloquially called “ food poisoning ” ) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria , viruses , or other parasites that contaminate food .	1	biology
 Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .	0	biology
 803 . Biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes : soil bacteria , cyanobacteria , and Frankia spp .	1	biology
 ( filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder , bayberry , and sweet fern ) .	0	biology
 806 . Microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes ( or microbial metabolism ) to remove pollutants .	1	biology
 Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals ( pesticides , fertilizers ) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface .	0	biology
 809 . Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic .	0	biology
 Their cells contain , in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles , another kind of organelle called a plastid .	0	biology
 When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis , their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments , called accessory pigments , which are involved in harvesting energy from light .	1	biology
 812 . Subtypes of heterotrophs , called saprobes , absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes .	1	biology
 Some protists can function as mixotrophs , obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes , depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available .	1	biology
 815 . The human parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa , the kinetoplastids .	0	biology
 The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast , a DNA mass carried within the single , oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells .	1	biology
 This subgroup includes several parasites , collectively called trypanosomes , which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle .	1	biology
 818 . Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane , called the anal pore .	1	biology
 In addition to a vacuole - based digestive system , Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles , which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell .	1	biology
 821 . The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod , thereby moving the entire cell .	0	biology
 This type of motion , called cytoplasmic streaming , is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen .	1	biology
 824 . For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi .	0	biology
 The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae .	1	biology
 Through mycorrhizae , the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively , lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner ( usually an alga ) .	1	biology
 827 . Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions .	1	biology
 Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts .	1	biology
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) and Candida species ( the agents of thrush , a common fungal infection ) are examples of unicellular fungi ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 830 . Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa ( singular , septum ) ( [ link]a , c ) .	1	biology
 In most phyla of fungi , tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha .	0	biology
 833 . Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive .	1	biology
 Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .	1	biology
 Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .	0	biology
 836 . The rings swell when they touch the nematode , gripping it in a tight hold .	0	biology
 The fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria .	0	biology
 Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria , as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host , release digestive enzymes within the host 's body , and absorb the digested nutrients .	1	biology
 839 . When both mating types are present in the same mycelium , it is called homothallic , or self - fertile .	1	biology
 Heterothallic mycelia require two different , but compatible , mycelia to reproduce sexually .	1	biology
 842 . The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes .	0	biology
 The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota , or true fungi .	1	biology
 845 . The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota , which is characterized by the formation of an ascus ( plural , asci ) , a sac - like structure that contains haploid ascospores .	1	biology
 Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance .	0	biology
 848 . This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage .	0	biology
 Eventually , the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp , which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground — this is what we think of as a mushroom .	1	biology
 The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap . Art Connection	0	biology
 851 . The Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about 230 species that all live in close association with the roots of trees .	1	biology
 Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .	0	biology
 854 . Both parasites and pathogens harm the host ; however , the pathogen causes a disease , whereas the parasite usually does not .	0	biology
 Commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other .	1	biology
 857 . Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans ( and other animals ) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins ( mycotoxins ) .	1	biology
 Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms .	1	biology
 In addition , individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions .	0	biology
 860 . The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .	0	biology
 In a second type , the Glomeromycete fungi form vesicular – arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( sometimes called endomycorrhizae ) .	0	biology
 In these mycorrhiza , the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 863 . Most biologists also consider green algae to be plants , although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom .	0	biology
 The reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae , the Charophytes , share common characteristics with land plants ( such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants ) .	0	biology
 These characteristics are absent in other types of algae .	0	biology
 866 . Two different types of spores are produced in land plants , resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle .	0	biology
 Seedless non - vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous .	1	biology
 The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants .	0	biology
 869 . The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .	0	biology
 872 . In the gametangia , precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis .	0	biology
 The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .	0	biology
 Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .	1	biology
 875 . In a further division , land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue , as detailed in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Plants that lack vascular tissue , which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients , are referred to as non - vascular plants .	1	biology
 Liverworts , mosses , and hornworts are seedless , non - vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution .	0	biology
 878 . Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually , by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae .	0	biology
 In this latter type of reproduction , the gemmae — small , intact , complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus ( shown in [ link])—are splashed out of the cup by raindrops .	0	biology
 The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes .	0	biology
 881 . For example , stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte , and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte ’s stalk .	0	biology
 Additionally , mosses are anchored to the substrate — whether it is soil , rock , or roof tiles — by multicellular rhizoids .	0	biology
 These structures are precursors of roots .	0	biology
 884 . A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal .	1	biology
 The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular , close - fitting units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on moisture levels , and periodically release spores .	0	biology
 887 . The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .	1	biology
 Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls , and are thus described as lignified .	1	biology
 Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue .	1	biology
 893 . Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia .	1	biology
 Strobili are cone - like structures that contain sporangia .	1	biology
 They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones .	0	biology
 896 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Whisk Ferns)While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots , the whisk ferns , Class Psilotopsida , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction .	0	biology
 Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia .	0	biology
 902 . Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation .	0	biology
 The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium , and later , the embryo , is called the integument .	1	biology
 905 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .	0	biology
 One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .	0	biology
 5603 . This must be contrasted with the absolute poverty that is frequently found in underdeveloped countries and defined as the inability , or near - inability , to afford basic necessities such as food ( Byrns 2011).We can not even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment in the United States .	1	sociology
 First , unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment , a state in which a person accepts a lower paying , lower status job than their education and experience qualifies them to perform .	1	sociology
 Second , unemployment statistics only count those :	0	sociology
 5606 . We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions .	1	sociology
 For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India . Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) .	1	sociology
 5609 . What if the U.S. economy thrived solely on basic bartering instead of its bustling agricultural and technological goods ?	0	sociology
 Would you still see a busy building like the one shown in [ link]?In sociology , economy refers to the social institution through which a society ’s resources are exchanged and managed .	1	sociology
 The earliest economies were based on trade , which is often a simple exchange in which people traded one item for another .	1	sociology
 5612 . At first , most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social groups ( Mauss 1922 ) .	0	sociology
 Exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering .	1	sociology
 This system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same time .	0	sociology
 5615 . The Industrial Revolution also changed agricultural practices .	0	sociology
 Until that time , many people practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their taxes .	1	sociology
 New technology introduced gasoline - powered farm tools such as tractors , seed drills , threshers , and combine harvesters .	0	sociology
 5618 . Because of challenges in their economies , several of these communist countries have moved from central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions .	0	sociology
 Market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism , like allowing limited private ownership or consulting market demands .	1	sociology
 This could involve situations like profits generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds ( Gregory and Stuart 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5621 . Markets produce goods as they are supposed to , but eventually the market is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands .	0	sociology
 Typically the market goes through phases of surplus , or excess , inflation , where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday , and recession , which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline .	1	sociology
 The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .	0	sociology
 5624 . Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing .	0	sociology
 Social stratification refers to a society ’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth , income , race , education , and power .	1	sociology
 5633 . This was generally a closed system , with people born into positions of nobility .	0	sociology
 Wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture , a law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son .	1	sociology
 If the family had no son , the land went to the next closest male relation .	0	sociology
 5636 . Individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons .	0	sociology
 Upward mobility refers to an increase — or upward shift — in social class .	1	sociology
 In the United States , people applaud the rags - to - riches achievements of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Michael Jordan .	0	sociology
 5642 . Global stratification compares the wealth , economic stability , status , and power of countries across the world .	1	sociology
 Global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality . In the early years of civilization , hunter - gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth and rarely interacted with other societies .	0	sociology
 5645 . Just as the United States ' wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class slowly disappears , global inequality is concentrating resources in certain nations and is significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries .	1	sociology
 In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .	0	sociology
 5648 . Familiar and still used by many , it classifies countries into first world , second world , and third world nations based on their respective economic development and standards of living .	0	sociology
 When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .	1	sociology
 The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .	1	sociology
 5651 . The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .	1	sociology
 Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .	1	sociology
 Also during the Cold War , global inequality was described in terms of economic development .	0	sociology
 5654 . We can be sure the workers in a Cuban cigar factory , for example , which are owned or leased by global core nation companies , are not enjoying the same privileges and rights as U.S. workers .	0	sociology
 Semi - peripheral nations are in - between nations , not powerful enough to dictate policy but nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle - class marketplace for core nations , while also exploiting peripheral nations .	1	sociology
 Mexico is an example , providing abundant cheap agricultural labor to the U.S. , and supplying goods to the United States market at a rate dictated by the U.S. without the constitutional protections offered to United States workers .	0	sociology
 5657 . Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .	1	sociology
 Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .	1	sociology
 As expected , global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost , including the building of infrastructure , training of workers , shipping of goods , and , of course , paying employee wages .	0	sociology
 5660 . People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .	0	sociology
 But it is true that you might feel ” poor ” if you are living without a car to drive to and from work , without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill , and without any “ extras ” beyond just making ends meet . Contrary to relative poverty , people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities , which typically include adequate food , clean water , safe housing , and access to healthcare .	1	sociology
 Absolute poverty is defined by the World Bank ( 2014a ) as when someone lives on less than $ 1.25 a day .	1	sociology
 5666 . Dependency TheoryDependency theory was created in part as a response to the Western - centric mindset of modernization theory .	0	sociology
 It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations ( or high - income nations ) exploiting semi - peripheral and peripheral nations ( or middle - income and low - income nations ) , which creates a cycle of dependence ( Hendricks 2010 ) .	1	sociology
 5669 . Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture — the practices , values , and beliefs of a group . This culture might include shared language , religion , and traditions , among other commonalities .	1	sociology
 5672 . Let us explore the differences between these concepts .	0	sociology
 Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people .	1	sociology
 Stereotypes can be based on race , ethnicity , age , gender , sexual orientation — almost any characteristic .	0	sociology
 5675 . The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .	1	sociology
 Institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of society .	1	sociology
 For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .	0	sociology
 5678 . For example , when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime , it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority .	0	sociology
 Another example of racist practices is racial steering , in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race .	1	sociology
 Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices .	0	sociology
 5681 . Ferguson ’s racial imbalance may explain in part why , even though in 2010 only about 63 percent of its population was black , in 2013 blacks were detained in 86 percent of stops , 92 percent of searches , and 93 percent of arrests ( Missouri Attorney General ’s Office 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 In addition , de facto segregation in Ferguson ’s schools , a race - based wealth gap , urban sprawl , and a black unemployment rate three times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities ( Bouie 2014).Multiple IdentitiesGolfer Tiger Woods has Chinese , Thai , African American , Native American , and Dutch heritage .	0	sociology
 Individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common .	0	sociology
 5684 . Genocide , the deliberate annihilation of a targeted ( usually subordinate ) group , is the most toxic intergroup relationship .	1	sociology
 Historically , we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group , intentional or not .	0	sociology
 5687 . Pluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a “ salad bowl ” : a great mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole .	0	sociology
 True pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures , both dominant and subordinate , creating a multicultural environment of acceptance .	1	sociology
 5690 . Asian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice , despite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority .	0	sociology
 The model minority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational , professional , and socioeconomic levels without challenging the existing establishment .	1	sociology
 5696 . Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ , which stands for “ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender ” ( and “ Queer ” or “ Questioning ” when the Q is added).Sociologically , it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage .	1	sociology
 In 1996 , The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) was passed , explicitly limiting the definition of “ marriage ” to a union between one man and one woman .	1	sociology
 It also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same - sex marriages performed in other states .	0	sociology
 5699 . Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .	1	sociology
 Transgender is not the same as homosexual , and many homosexual males view both their sex and gender as male .	0	sociology
 5702 . Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism .	0	sociology
 Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another .	1	sociology
 It varies in its level of severity .	0	sociology
 5705 . The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .	1	sociology
 This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .	0	sociology
 5708 . Madame Jeanne Calment of France was the world 's oldest living person until she died at 122 years old ; there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as 115 years or older ( Diebel 2014).Supercentenarians are people living to 110 years or more .	1	sociology
 In August 2014 , there were seventy - five verified supercentenarians worldwide — seventy - three women and two men .	0	sociology
 5711 . Social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social ( and sociological ) aspects of aging .	1	sociology
 Researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific ages , such as mental and physical wellbeing , plus age - specific concerns such as the process of dying .	0	sociology
 5714 . Baby BoomersOf particular interest to gerontologists today is the population of baby boomers , the cohort born between 1946 and 1964 and now reaching their 60s .	1	sociology
 Coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s , the baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and therefore their own marketing power ( Macunovich 2000 ) .	0	sociology
 5717 . It is helpful to understand aging in the context of these phases .	0	sociology
 A life course is the period from birth to death , including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation .	1	sociology
 Each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations , which of course vary by individual and culture .	0	sociology
 5720 . For many teenagers and young adults , losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first loss of a loved one they experience .	0	sociology
 It may be their first encounter with grief , a psychological , emotional , and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event .	1	sociology
 5723 . The changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society ’s changing view of death .	0	sociology
 Hospice is a type of healthcare that treats terminally ill people when “ cure - oriented treatments ” are no longer an option ( Hospice Foundation of America 2012b ) .	1	sociology
 5726 . In early societies , the elderly were respected and revered .	0	sociology
 Many preindustrial societies observed gerontocracy , a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society ’s oldest members .	1	sociology
 In some countries today , the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected .	0	sociology
 5729 . The social withdrawal that Cummings and Henry recognized ( 1961 ) , and its notion that elderly people need to find replacement roles for those they ’ve lost , is addressed anew in activity theory .	0	sociology
 According to this theory , activity levels and social involvement are key to this process , and key to happiness ( Havinghurst 1961 ; Neugarten 1964 ; Havinghurst , Neugarten , and Tobin 1968 ) .	1	sociology
 5732 . Another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory ( Riley , Johnson , and Foner 1972 ) .	0	sociology
 Though it may seem obvious now , with our awareness of ageism , age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age , just as they are stratified by race , class , and gender .	0	sociology
 5735 . Another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with compensation theory .	0	sociology
 Baltes and Baltes ( 1990 ) based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection , optimization , and compensation .	1	sociology
 5738 . Sociologists , on the other hand , tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict configuration of status roles .	0	sociology
 Here , we ’ll define family as a socially recognized group ( usually joined by blood , marriage , cohabitation , or adoption ) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .	0	sociology
 5741 . Marriage PatternsWith single parenting and cohabitation ( when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage ) becoming more acceptable in recent years , people may be less motivated to get married .	1	sociology
 In a recent survey , 39 percent of respondents answered “ yes ” when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete ( Pew Research Center 2010 ) .	0	sociology
 5744 . Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .	0	sociology
 Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .	1	sociology
 The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .	1	sociology
 5747 . Both paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one ’s family .	1	sociology
 This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .	0	sociology
 Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .	1	sociology
 5750 . There are three types of unilateral descent : patrilineal , which follows the father ’s line only ; matrilineal , which follows the mother ’s side only ; and ambilineal , which follows either the father ’s only or the mother ’s side only , depending on the situation .	1	sociology
 In partrilineal societies , such as those in rural China and India , only males carry on the family surname .	0	sociology
 5753 . Today , however , these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms .	0	sociology
 While reviewing some of these once - popular theories , it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses . The set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle .	1	sociology
 One of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by Paul Glick in 1955 .	0	sociology
 5756 . Of these children , 54 percent live with grandparents , 21 percent live with other relatives , and 24 percent live with nonrelatives .	0	sociology
 This family structure is referred to as the extended family , and may include aunts , uncles , and cousins living in the same home .	0	sociology
 Foster parents account for about a quarter of nonrelatives .	0	sociology
 5759 . Some people associate religion with places of worship ( a synagogue or church ) , others with a practice ( confession or meditation ) , and still others with a concept that guides their daily lives ( like dharma or sin ) .	0	sociology
 All these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs , values , and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant . Does religion bring fear , wonder , relief , explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice ?	1	sociology
 How do our religious perspectives affect our behavior ?	0	sociology
 5762 . Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .	0	sociology
 Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group , such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins ( Barkan and Greenwood 2003).The History of Religion as a Sociological ConceptIn the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization , three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society : Émile Durkheim , Max Weber , and Karl Marx .	1	sociology
 They are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology .	0	sociology
 5765 . Some sects do not grow into denominations .	1	sociology
 Sociologists call these established sects .	0	sociology
 Established sects , such as the Amish or Jehovah ’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia – cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect - like and denomination - like characteristics .	0	sociology
 5768 . Note that some religions may be practiced — or understood — in various categories .	0	sociology
 For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .	0	sociology
 Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .	0	sociology
 5771 . Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .	1	sociology
 It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .	1	sociology
 While typically not an organized group , atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population .	0	sociology
 5774 . Education is a social institution through which a society ’s children are taught basic academic knowledge , learning skills , and cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Every nation in the world is equipped with some form of education system , though those systems vary greatly .	0	sociology
 5777 . Cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values , beliefs , and social norms of their culture .	1	sociology
 Both informal and formal education include cultural transmission .	0	sociology
 5780 . Another role of schools , according to functionalist theory , is that of sorting , or classifying students based on academic merit or potential .	0	sociology
 The most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements .	0	sociology
 5783 . This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .	0	sociology
 Conflict theorists point to tracking , a formalized sorting system that places students on “ tracks ” ( advanced versus low achievers ) that perpetuate inequalities .	1	sociology
 While educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers , conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self - fulfilling prophecies in which students live up ( or down ) to teacher and societal expectations ( Education Week 2004 ) .	0	sociology
 5786 . The findings in the Coleman Report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the United States .	0	sociology
 The federal Head Start program , which is still active and successful today , was developed to give low - income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in Coleman ’s findings .	0	sociology
 The program provides academic - centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status .	1	sociology
 5789 . Government leaders might have this kind of influence as well , but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government .	0	sociology
 As this example indicates , there is more than one type of authority in a community . Authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow .	1	sociology
 People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect .	0	sociology
 5792 . Followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader ’s personal qualities .	0	sociology
 The appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary , and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution .	0	sociology
 5795 . The power held by these positions varies from one country to another .	0	sociology
 Strictly speaking , a monarchy is a government in which a single person ( a monarch ) rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne .	1	sociology
 Usually , a monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of some sort of divine appointment or calling .	0	sociology
 5798 . The power in an oligarchy is held by a small , elite group .	1	sociology
 Unlike in a monarchy , members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry .	0	sociology
 5801 . A democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice , or vote , in determining state policy , regardless of their level of socioeconomic status .	1	sociology
 Another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike .	0	sociology
 1214 . Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .	1	biology
 Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand , silt , and humus ; these soils are called loams .	1	biology
 1217 . The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .	1	biology
 Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .	1	biology
 1220 . The soil profile has four distinct layers : 1 ) O horizon ; 2 ) A horizon ; 3 ) B horizon , or subsoil ; and 4 ) C horizon , or soil base ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter — humus — at its surface , with decomposed vegetation at its base .	1	biology
 Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention .	0	biology
 1226 . A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival .	0	biology
 Some parasitic plants have no leaves .	0	biology
 1229 . An epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants , but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Epiphytes have two types of roots : clinging aerial roots , which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees ; and aerial roots , which absorb moisture from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 1232 . The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .	0	biology
 Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .	0	biology
 After reaching maturity , the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis , which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte .	0	biology
 1235 . The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .	0	biology
 The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .	1	biology
 The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma , style , and ovary .	1	biology
 1238 . Female Gametophyte ( The Embryo Sac)While the details may vary between species , the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases .	0	biology
 First , in the process of megasporogenesis , a single cell in the diploid megasporangium — an area of tissue in the ovules — undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores , only one of which survives .	1	biology
 During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac .	1	biology
 1241 . This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .	0	biology
 Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells , which later degenerate .	0	biology
 The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete , or egg cell , and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1244 . Male GametophyteA male cone has a central axis on which bracts , a type of modified leaf , are attached .	0	biology
 The bracts are known as microsporophylls ( [ link ] ) and are the sites where microspores will develop .	1	biology
 The microspores develop inside the microsporangium .	0	biology
 1247 . Pollination takes two forms : self - pollination and cross - pollination .	0	biology
 Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 1250 . The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac , and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle .	0	biology
 Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1253 . The terminal cell also divides , giving rise to a globular - shaped proembryo ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 In dicots ( eudicots ) , the developing embryo has a heart shape , due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons ( [ link]b ) .	1	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , such as Capsella bursa , the endosperm develops initially , but is then digested , and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons .	1	biology
 1256 . The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo .	0	biology
 In endospermic dicots , the food reserves are stored in the endosperm .	0	biology
 During germination , the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves , much like in monocots ( monocots , by definition , also have endospermic seeds ) .	0	biology
 1259 . The embryonic axis consists of three parts : the plumule , the radicle , and the hypocotyl .	1	biology
 The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 1262 . The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .	1	biology
 The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .	1	biology
 This shape is called the plumule hook , and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark .	0	biology
 1265 . Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity , or extremely low metabolic activity : a process known as dormancy , which may last for months , years or even centuries .	1	biology
 Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions .	0	biology
 1268 . Fruits may be classified as simple , aggregate , multiple , or accessory , depending on their origin ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 1271 . An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .	0	biology
 Accessory fruits ( sometimes called false fruits ) are not derived from the ovary , but from another part of the flower , such as the receptacle ( strawberry ) or the hypanthium ( apples and pears ) .	1	biology
 1274 . Either the ovule or part of the ovary , which is diploid in nature , gives rise to a new seed .	1	biology
 This method of reproduction is known as apomixis .	0	biology
 1277 . Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings , where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root .	1	biology
 In some species , stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water .	0	biology
 1280 . In another classification based on flowering frequency , monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime ; examples include bamboo and yucca .	1	biology
 During the vegetative period of their life cycle ( which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species ) , these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once - in - a - lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization .	0	biology
 1283 . They are asymmetrical , radial , or bilateral in form as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry ; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge .	1	biology
 Radial symmetry , as illustrated in [ link ] , describes when an animal has an up - and - down orientation : any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves , but not a definite right or left side .	1	biology
 1286 . No energy system is one hundred percent efficient , and an animal ’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat .	0	biology
 If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature , it is classified as a warm - blooded animal and called an endotherm .	1	biology
 The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 1289 . Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor .	0	biology
 Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions .	1	biology
 Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .	0	biology
 1292 . A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes .	0	biology
 A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 1295 . A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .	1	biology
 This is sometimes called a cross section , and , if the transverse cut is at an angle , it is called an oblique plane .	1	biology
 1298 . Epithelial TissuesEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells .	1	biology
 The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells .	0	biology
 1301 . Cuboidal epithelial cells , shown in [ link ] , are cube - shaped with a single , central nucleus .	1	biology
 They are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material .	0	biology
 1304 . Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system , primarily in the bladder and ureter .	1	biology
 These cells are arranged in a stratified layer , but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed , empty bladder , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1307 . Loose connective tissue , also called areolar connective tissue , has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue .	1	biology
 As illustrated in [ link ] , loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts ; macrophages are present as well .	0	biology
 1310 . Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .	1	biology
 The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	1	biology
 1313 . A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .	1	biology
 The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	1	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 1316 . The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point .	1	biology
 While there are normal fluctuations from the set point , the body ’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point .	0	biology
 1319 . Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level .	0	biology
 This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop .	0	biology
 1322 . Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant - based .	1	biology
 Examples of herbivores , as shown in [ link ] include vertebrates like deer , koalas , and some bird species , as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars .	0	biology
 1328 . Because most birds fly , their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low .	0	biology
 The stomach of birds has two chambers : the proventriculus , where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach , and the gizzard , where the food is stored , soaked , and mechanically ground .	1	biology
 The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated .	0	biology
 1331 . Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .	1	biology
 Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .	1	biology
 Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides .	0	biology
 1334 . The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .	0	biology
 The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The peristalsis wave is unidirectional — it moves food from the mouth to the stomach , and reverse movement is not possible .	0	biology
 1337 . Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber .	0	biology
 Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen .	1	biology
 Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides ; it also helps activate more pepsinogen , starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin .	0	biology
 1340 . The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein , fats , and carbohydrates is completed .	1	biology
 The small intestine is a long tube - like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger - like projections called the villi .	1	biology
 The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli .	1	biology
 1346 . The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation .	0	biology
 1349 . The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices .	0	biology
 The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature ; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate , an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme .	1	biology
 1352 . The omega-3 alpha - linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids .	0	biology
 Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and , for this reason , are considered to be co - enzymes .	1	biology
 Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health , as outlined in [ link ] and [ link ] .	0	biology
 1355 . Digestion and AbsorptionDigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments .	1	biology
 It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium .	0	biology
 1358 . Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases ( those that break down peptides ) .	1	biology
 Specifically , carboxypeptidase , dipeptidase , and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids .	0	biology
 The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines .	0	biology
 1361 . The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach .	1	biology
 It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase .	0	biology
 1364 . One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment .	0	biology
 During the gastric phase , the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins .	0	biology
 Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 1367 . In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .	1	biology
 Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .	0	biology
 Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices , it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum .	1	biology
 1370 . Neurons also contain unique structures , illustrated in [ link ] for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible .	0	biology
 Dendrites are tree - like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses .	1	biology
 Although some neurons do not have any dendrites , some types of neurons have multiple dendrites .	0	biology
 1373 . Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons .	0	biology
 Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction .	1	biology
 This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes .	0	biology
 1376 . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses .	0	biology
 Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	1	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 1379 . One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .	0	biology
 This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 1382 . Voltage - gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell .	0	biology
 The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential .	1	biology
 1385 . To accomplish this , the Na+ channels close and can not be opened .	0	biology
 This begins the neuron 's refractory period , in which it can not produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open .	0	biology
 At the same time , voltage - gated K+ channels open , allowing K+ to leave the cell .	0	biology
 1388 . This depolarization causes voltage - gated Ca2 + channels to open .	0	biology
 Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane - bound vesicles , called synaptic vesicles , containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 Synaptic vesicles are shown in [ link ] , which is an image from a scanning electron microscope .	0	biology
 1391 . This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .	0	biology
 Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .	1	biology
 For example , when the neurotransmitter GABA ( gamma - aminobutyric acid ) is released from a presynaptic neuron , it binds to and opens Cl- channels .	0	biology
 1394 . Long - term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long - term weakening of a synaptic connection .	1	biology
 One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors .	0	biology
 1397 . The dura mater also contains vein - like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart .	0	biology
 The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 1400 . The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .	1	biology
 The brain floats in CSF , which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant .	0	biology
 1403 . The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain , over the eyes .	1	biology
 This lobe contains the olfactory bulb , which processes smells .	0	biology
 1406 . The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain .	1	biology
 It is primarily involved in vision — seeing , recognizing , and identifying the visual world .	0	biology
 1409 . Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) , shown in [ link]b , play important roles in movement control and posture .	1	biology
 Damage to the basal ganglia , as in Parkinson ’s disease , leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking .	0	biology
 1412 . The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion , as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation .	1	biology
 It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 1415 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) , shown in [ link ] , sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem .	1	biology
 The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks .	0	biology
 1418 . The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system , which controls bodily functions without conscious control , and the sensory - somatic nervous system , which transmits sensory information from the skin , muscles , and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles .	1	biology
 1421 . The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .	1	biology
 Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs .	1	biology
 As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive .	0	biology
 1424 . Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body .	1	biology
 Each of the 31 spinal nerves ( in humans ) contains both sensory and motor axons .	0	biology
 1427 . Like Alzheimer ’s disease , Parkinson ’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease .	1	biology
 It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817 .	0	biology
 1430 . Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States .	0	biology
 Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination , inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations .	0	biology
 1433 . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration .	1	biology
 Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation .	1	biology
 Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	0	biology
 1436 . The first step in sensation is reception , which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being bent or squished , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature .	1	biology
 The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 1439 . How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?	0	biology
 In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in [ link ] ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure .	1	biology
 Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential .	0	biology
 1442 . A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions .	0	biology
 Merkel ’s disks ( shown in [ link ] ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates .	1	biology
 Merkel ’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips .	0	biology
 1445 . Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors .	0	biology
 It is not surprising , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli . Pacinian corpuscles ( seen in [ link ] ) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner ’s corpuscles ; they are found in the bone periosteum , joint capsules , pancreas and other viscera , breast , and genitals .	1	biology
 They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient ( but not prolonged ) pressure and high - frequency vibration .	0	biology
 1448 . Pain is the name given to nociception , which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage .	1	biology
 Pain is caused by true sources of injury , such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical .	0	biology
 1451 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 1454 . The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	1	biology
 The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .	0	biology
 The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup .	0	biology
 1457 . The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid ( perilymph ) inside the cochlea .	0	biology
 The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1460 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	0	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	1	biology
 1463 . Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images .	1	biology
 Animals are bombarded with sensory information , and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic .	0	biology
 1466 . It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ( [ link]b ) .	0	biology
 The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 1469 . Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .	0	biology
 Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short .	1	biology
 For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 1472 . The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision .	1	biology
 The fovea has a high density of cones .	0	biology
 1475 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	1	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1478 . Taste , also called gustation , and smell , also called olfaction , are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors .	1	biology
 Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival .	0	biology
 1481 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .	1	biology
 Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 1484 . PheromonesA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species .	1	biology
 Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them , but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors .	0	biology
 1487 . Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin , unmyelinated axons .	1	biology
 The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli , and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor , so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant .	1	biology
 From glomeruli , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus .	0	biology
 1490 . The amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan , shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 If a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ -ine ” .	0	biology
 1493 . Additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity .	0	biology
 In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1496 . Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid - derived ( lipid - soluble ) and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells .	0	biology
 Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors .	1	biology
 Unlike steroid hormones , lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on DNA .	0	biology
 1499 . When a hormone binds to the receptor , the G - protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , in place of GDP .	0	biology
 After binding , GTP is hydrolysed by the G - protein into GDP and becomes inactive . The activated G - protein in turn activates a membrane - bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase .	0	biology
 Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP .	1	biology
 1502 . Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone .	1	biology
 A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands .	0	biology
 1505 . It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 1508 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .	1	biology
 This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .	1	biology
 A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another ; therefore , the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones : growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , melanin - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .	1	biology
 1511 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .	0	biology
 It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system .	0	biology

 Everyone in Europe ’s feudal society had a job to do and worked hard .	0	history
 2121 . Muslims , however , retained control of much of Spain , where Córdoba , known for leather and wool production , became a major center of learning and trade .	0	history
 By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .	1	history
 This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .	1	history
 2124 . Although there were large trading centers along these rivers , most West Africans lived in small villages and identified with their extended family or their clan .	0	history

 2139 . For this reason , Pilgrims are known as Separatists . Like Jamestown , Plymouth occupies an iconic place in American national memory .	0	history
 The tale of the 102 migrants who crossed the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower and their struggle for survival is a well - known narrative of the founding of the country .	0	history
 Their story includes the signing of the Mayflower Compact , a written agreement whereby the English voluntarily agreed to help each other .	1	history
 2145 . American silver , tobacco , and other items , which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes , became European commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold .	0	history
 Before the arrival of the Spanish , for example , the Inca people of the Andes consumed chicha , a corn beer , for ritual purposes only .	1	history
 When the Spanish discovered chicha , they bought and traded for it , turning it into a commodity instead of a ritual substance .	0	history
 2148 . In eastern North America , some native peoples interpreted death from disease as a hostile act .	0	history
 Some groups , including the Iroquois , engaged in raids or “ mourning wars , ” taking enemy prisoners in order to assuage their grief and replace the departed .	1	history
 In a special ritual , the prisoners were “ requickened”—assigned the identity of a dead person — and adopted by the bereaved family to take the place of their dead .	1	history
 2151 . Columbus ’s 1493 letter — or probanza de mérito ( proof of merit)—describing his “ discovery ” of a New World did much to inspire excitement in Europe .	1	history
 Probanzas de méritos were reports and letters written by Spaniards in the New World to the Spanish crown , designed to win royal patronage .	0	history
 2154 . Calvinism emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient God and stressed the idea of predestination , the belief that God selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation .	1	history
 Calvinists believed that reading scripture prepared sinners , if they were among the elect , to receive God ’s grace .	0	history
 2157 . Nonetheless , those indentured servants who completed their term of service often began new lives as tobacco planters .	0	history
 To entice even more migrants to the New World , the Virginia Company also implemented the headright system , in which those who paid their own passage to Virginia received fifty acres plus an additional fifty for each servant or family member they brought with them .	1	history
 The headright system and the promise of a new life for servants acted as powerful incentives for English migrants to hazard the journey to the New World .	0	history
 2160 . In 1565 , the victorious Menéndez founded St. Augustine , now the oldest European settlement in the Americas .	1	history
 In the process , the Spanish displaced the local Timucua Indians from their ancient town of Seloy , which had stood for thousands of years ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 The Timucua suffered greatly from diseases introduced by the Spanish , shrinking from a population of around 200,000 pre - contact to fifty thousand in 1590 .	0	history
 2163 . Everywhere , Africans resisted slavery , and running away was common .	0	history
 In Jamaica and elsewhere , runaway slaves created maroon communities , groups that resisted recapture and eked out a living from the land , rebuilding their communities as best they could .	1	history
 When possible , they adhered to traditional ways , following spiritual leaders such as Vodun priests .	0	history
 2166 . Conflict with native peoples , as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch West India Company ’s trading practices , made the Dutch outpost an undesirable place for many migrants .	0	history
 The small size of the population meant a severe labor shortage , and to complete the arduous tasks of early settlement , the Dutch West India Company imported some 450 African slaves between 1626 and 1664 .	0	history
 ( The company had involved itself heavily in the slave trade and in 1637 captured Elmina , the slave - trading post on the west coast of Africa , from the Portuguese . )	1	history
 2169 . The final imperial war , the French and Indian War ( 1754–1763 ) , known as the Seven Years’ War ( 1756–1763 ) in Europe , proved to be the decisive contest between Britain and France in America .	1	history
 It began over rival claims along the frontier in present - day western Pennsylvania .	0	history
 2172 . In England , opponents of James II ’s efforts to create a centralized Catholic state were known as Whigs .	1	history

There they exhibited a fine example of industry , by spinning from sunrise until dark , and displayed a spirit for saving their sinking country rarely to be found among persons of more age and experience . ” At dinner , they “ cheerfully agreed to omit tea , to render their conduct consistent .	0	history
 Besides this instance of their patriotism , before they separated , they unanimously resolved that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional , that they would purchase no more British manufactures unless it be repealed , and that they would not even admit the addresses of any gentlemen should they have the opportunity , without they determined to oppose its execution to the last extremity , if the occasion required . ” The Daughters’ non - importation movement broadened the protest against the Stamp Act , giving women a new and active role in the political dissent of the time .	0	history
 Women were responsible for purchasing goods for the home , so by exercising the power of the purse , they could wield more power than they had in the past .	0	history

 2205 . In June , General Gage resolved to take Breed ’s Hill and Bunker Hill , the high ground across the Charles River from Boston , a strategic site that gave the rebel militias an advantage since they could train their cannons on the British .	0	history
 In the Battle of Bunker Hill ( [ link ] ) , on June 17 , the British launched three assaults on the hills , gaining control only after the rebels ran out of ammunition .	1	history
 2208 . In this way , Paine helped to channel colonial discontent toward the king himself and not , as had been the case , toward the British Parliament — a bold move that signaled the desire to create a new political order disavowing monarchy entirely .	0	history
 He argued for the creation of an American republic , a state without a king , and extolled the blessings of republicanism , a political philosophy that held that elected representatives , not a hereditary monarch , should govern states .	1	history
 The vision of an American republic put forward by Paine included the idea of popular sovereignty : citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them , and decide other issues , on the basis of majority rule .	1	history

 2214 . During the war , all the states passed confiscation acts , which gave the new revolutionary governments in the former colonies the right to seize Loyalist land and property .	1	history
 To ferret out Loyalists , revolutionary governments also passed laws requiring the male population to take oaths of allegiance to the new states .	0	history
 2217 . While republicanism offered an alternative to monarchy , it was also an alternative to democracy , a system of government characterized by majority rule , where the majority of citizens have the power to make decisions binding upon the whole .	1	history
 To many revolutionaries , especially wealthy landowners , merchants , and planters , democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy .	0	history
 2220 . In eighteenth - century America , as in Great Britain , the legal status of married women was defined as coverture , meaning a married woman ( or feme covert ) had no legal or economic status independent of her husband .	1	history
 She could not conduct business or buy and sell property .	0	history
 2223 . Responding to a request for advice on proper government from North Carolina , Adams wrote Thoughts on Government , which influenced many state legislatures .	0	history
 Adams did not advocate democracy ; rather , he wrote , “ there is no good government but what is republican . ” Fearing the potential for tyranny with only one group in power , he suggested a system of checks and balances in which three separate branches of government — executive , legislative , and judicial — would maintain a balance of power .	0	history
 He also proposed that each state remain sovereign , as its own republic .	0	history
 2226 . James Madison put forward a proposition known as the Virginia Plan , which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws ( [ link ] ) .	1	history
 The plan featured a bicameral or two - house legislature , with an upper and a lower house .	0	history
 2229 . The Virginia Plan ’s call for proportional representation alarmed the representatives of the smaller states .	0	history
 William Paterson introduced a New Jersey Plan to counter Madison ’s scheme , proposing that all states have equal votes in a unicameral national legislature .	1	history
 He also addressed the economic problems of the day by calling for the Congress to have the power to regulate commerce , to raise revenue though taxes on imports and through postage , and to enforce Congressional requisitions from the states .	0	history
 2232 . Thus , to avoid giving the people too much direct power , the delegates made certain that senators were chosen by the state legislatures , not elected directly by the people ( direct elections of senators came with the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1913 ) .	0	history
 As an additional safeguard , the delegates created the Electoral College , the mechanism for choosing the president .	1	history
 Under this plan , each state has a certain number of electors , which is its number of senators ( two ) plus its number of representatives in the House of Representatives .	0	history
 2235 . Federalists followed through on their promise to add such a bill in 1789 , when Virginia Representative James Madison introduced and Congress approved the Bill of Rights ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Adopted in 1791 , the bill consisted of the first ten amendments to the Constitution and outlined many of the personal rights state constitutions already guaranteed .	1	history
 2238 . Opposition to the Federalists led to the formation of Democratic - Republican societies , composed of men who felt the domestic policies of the Washington administration were designed to enrich the few while ignoring everyone else .	1	history
 Democratic - Republicans championed limited government .	0	history
 Their fear of centralized power originated in the experience of the 1760s and 1770s when the distant , overbearing , and seemingly corrupt British Parliament attempted to impose its will on the colonies .	0	history
 2241 . President Washington and Hamilton denounced Genêt , knowing his actions threatened to pull the United States into a war with Great Britain .	0	history
 The Citizen Genêt affair , as it became known , spurred Great Britain to instruct its naval commanders in the West Indies to seize all ships trading with the French .	0	history
 The British captured hundreds of American ships and their cargoes , increasing the possibility of war between the two countries . In this tense situation , Great Britain worked to prevent a wider conflict by ending its seizure of American ships and offered to pay for captured cargoes .	0	history
 2244 . The Revolution of 1800 refers to the first transfer of power from one party to another in American history , when the presidency passed to Democratic - Republican Thomas Jefferson ( [ link ] ) in the 1800 election .	1	history

 2250 . In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century , merchants in the Northeast and elsewhere turned their attention as never before to the benefits of using unskilled wage labor to make a greater profit by reducing labor costs .	0	history
 They used the putting - out system , which the British had employed at the beginning of their own Industrial Revolution , whereby they hired farming families to perform specific tasks in the production process for a set wage .	1	history
 In the case of shoes , for instance , American merchants hired one group of workers to cut soles into standardized sizes .	0	history
 2253 . Critics of industrialization blamed it for the increased concentration of wealth in the hands of the few : the factory owners made vast profits while the workers received only a small fraction of the revenue from what they produced .	0	history
 Under the labor theory of value , said critics , the value of a product should accurately reflect the labor needed to produce it .	1	history
 Profits from the sale of goods produced by workers should be distributed so laborers recovered in the form of wages the value their effort had added to the finished product .	0	history
 2256 . Many Americans were struck with “ land fever . ” Farmers strove to expand their acreage , and those who lived in areas where unoccupied land was scarce sought holdings in the West .	1	history

 The federal government funded this important artery to the West , beginning the creation of a transportation infrastructure for the benefit of settlers and farmers .	0	history
 2262 . This class of upwardly mobile citizens promoted temperance , or abstinence from alcohol .	1	history
 They also gave their support to Protestant ministers like Charles Grandison Finney , who preached that all people possessed free moral agency , meaning they could change their lives and bring about their own salvation , a message that resonated with members of the middle class , who already believed their worldly efforts had led to their economic success .	0	history
 2265 . Under the leadership of Martin Van Buren , New York ’s “ Bucktail ” Republican faction ( so named because members wore a deer ’s tail on their hats , a symbol of membership in the Tammany Society ) gained political power by cultivating loyalty to the will of the majority , not to an elite family or renowned figure .	0	history
 The Bucktails emphasized a pragmatic approach .	0	history
 For example , at first they opposed the Erie Canal project , but when the popularity of the massive transportation venture became clear , they supported it .	0	history
 2268 . Secretary of State Clay championed what was known as the American System of high tariffs , a national bank , and federally sponsored internal improvements of canals and roads .	0	history
 Once in office , President Adams embraced Clay ’s American System and proposed a national university and naval academy to train future leaders of the republic .	0	history
 2271 . In addition to dealing with rancor over rotation in office , the Jackson administration became embroiled in a personal scandal known as the Petticoat affair .	0	history
 This incident exacerbated the division between the president ’s team and the insider class in the nation ’s capital , who found the new arrivals from Tennessee lacking in decorum and propriety .	0	history
 2274 . As Jackson portrayed it , his was a battle for small government and ordinary Americans .	0	history
 His stand against what bank opponents called the “ monster bank ” proved very popular , and the Democratic press lionized him for it ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 In the election of 1832 , Jackson received nearly 53 percent of the popular vote against his opponent Henry Clay .	1	history
 2277 . Jackson ’s anti - Indian stance struck a chord with a majority of white citizens , many of whom shared a hatred of nonwhites that spurred Congress to pass the 1830 Indian Removal Act .	0	history
 The act called for the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from their home in the southeastern United States to land in the West , in present - day Oklahoma .	1	history
 2280 . The presidential election contest of 1840 marked the culmination of the democratic revolution that swept the United States .	0	history
 By this time , the second party system had taken hold , a system whereby the older Federalist and Democratic - Republican Parties had been replaced by the new Democratic and Whig Parties .	1	history
 Both Whigs and Democrats jockeyed for election victories and commanded the steady loyalty of political partisans .	0	history
 2283 . To head the expedition into the Louisiana territory , Jefferson appointed his friend and personal secretary , twenty - nine - year - old army captain Meriwether Lewis , who was instructed to form a Corps of Discovery .	0	history
 Lewis in turn selected William Clark , who had once been his commanding officer , to help him lead the group ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2286 . Congress finally came to an agreement , called the Missouri Compromise , in 1820 .	0	history
 Missouri and Maine ( which had been part of Massachusetts ) would enter the Union at the same time , Maine as a free state , Missouri as a slave state .	1	history
 2289 . An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land .	1	history

 2292 . Outraged , Edwards and a small party of men took prisoner the alcalde of Nacogdoches .	0	history
 The Mexican army marched to the town , and Edwards and his troop then declared the formation of the Republic of Fredonia between the Sabine and Rio Grande Rivers .	0	history
 To demonstrate loyalty to their adopted country , a force led by Stephen Austin hastened to Nacogdoches to support the Mexican army .	0	history
 2295 . The United States had no way of knowing that part of the land about to be ceded by Mexico had just become far more valuable than anyone could have imagined .	0	history
 On January 24 , 1848 , James Marshall discovered gold in the millrace of the sawmill he had built with his partner John Sutter on the south fork of California ’s American River .	0	history
 Word quickly spread , and within a few weeks all of Sutter ’s employees had left to search for gold .	0	history
 2298 . The 1840s were a particularly active time in the creation and reorganization of political parties and constituencies , mainly because of discontent with the positions of the mainstream Whig and Democratic Parties in regard to slavery and its extension into the territories .	0	history
 The first new party , the small and politically weak Liberty Party founded in 1840 , was a single - issue party , as were many of those that followed it .	0	history
 Its members were abolitionists who fervently believed slavery was evil and should be ended , and that this was best accomplished by political means .	0	history
 2301 . In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time , southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories .	0	history
 Many in the Free - Soil Party believed in this far - reaching conspiracy of the slaveholding elite to control both foreign affairs and domestic policies for their own ends , a cabal that came to be known as the Slave Power .	1	history
 2304 . By 1860 , the region was producing two - thirds of the world ’s cotton .	0	history
 In 1793 , Eli Whitney revolutionized the production of cotton when he invented the cotton gin , a device that separated the seeds from raw cotton .	1	history
 Suddenly , a process that was extraordinarily labor - intensive when done by hand could be completed quickly and easily .	0	history
 2307 . Southern whites frequently relied upon the idea of paternalism — the premise that white slaveholders acted in the best interests of slaves , taking responsibility for their care , feeding , discipline , and even their Christian morality — to justify the existence of slavery .	1	history
 This grossly misrepresented the reality of slavery , which was , by any measure , a dehumanizing , traumatizing , and horrifying human disaster and crime against humanity .	0	history
 2310 . The North also produced defenders of slavery , including Louis Agassiz , a Harvard professor of zoology and geology .	0	history
 Agassiz helped to popularize polygenism , the idea that different human races came from separate origins .	1	history
 According to this formulation , no single human family origin existed , and blacks made up a race wholly separate from the white race .	0	history
 2313 . The reform efforts of the antebellum era sprang from the Protestant revival fervor that found expression in what historians refer to as the Second Great Awakening .	1	history
 ( The First Great Awakening of evangelical Protestantism had taken place in the 1730s and 1740s . )	0	history
 2316 . Beginning in the 1820s , a new intellectual movement known as transcendentalism began to grow in the Northeast .	0	history
 In this context , to transcend means to go beyond the ordinary sensory world to grasp personal insights and gain appreciation of a deeper reality , and transcendentalists believed that all people could attain an understanding of the world that surpassed rational , sensory experience .	1	history
 2319 . The Shakers provide another example of a community established with a religious mission .	0	history
 The Shakers started in England as an outgrowth of the Quaker religion in the middle of the eighteenth century .	0	history
 2322 . Thereafter , most temperance societies advocated total abstinence ; no longer would beer and wine be tolerated .	0	history
 Such total abstinence from alcohol is known as teetotalism .	1	history
 2325 . During the early nineteenth century , reformers also interested themselves in the workings of the mind in an effort to better understand the effects of a rapidly changing world awash with religious revivals and democratic movements .	0	history
 Phrenology — the mapping of the cranium to specific human attributes — stands as an early type of science , related to what would become psychology and devoted to understanding how the mind worked .	1	history
 Phrenologists believed that the mind contained thirty - seven “ faculties , ” the strengths or weaknesses of which could be determined by a close examination of the size and shape of the cranium ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2328 . They rejected colonization as a racist scheme and opposed the use of violence to end slavery .	0	history
 Influenced by evangelical Protestantism , Garrison and other abolitionists believed in moral suasion , a technique of appealing to the conscience of the public , especially slaveholders .	1	history
 Moral suasion relied on dramatic narratives , often from former slaves , about the horrors of slavery , arguing that slavery destroyed families , as children were sold and taken away from their mothers and fathers ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2331 . The issue of what to do with the western territories added to the republic by the Mexican Cession consumed Congress in 1850 .	0	history
 Other controversial matters , which had been simmering over time , complicated the problem further .	0	history
 2334 . As these different factions were agitating for the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska , leaders of the Democratic Party in 1853 and 1854 sought to bind their party together in the aftermath of intraparty fights over the distribution of patronage jobs .	0	history
 Illinois Democratic senator Stephen Douglas believed he had found a solution — the Kansas - Nebraska bill — that would promote party unity and also satisfy his colleagues from the South , who detested the Missouri Compromise line .	0	history
 In January 1854 , Douglas introduced the bill ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2337 . The events in Kansas served as an extreme reply to Douglas ’s proposition of popular sovereignty .	0	history
 As the violent clashes increased , Kansas became known as “ Bleeding Kansas . ” Antislavery advocates’ use of force carved out a new direction for some who opposed slavery .	0	history
 Distancing themselves from William Lloyd Garrison and other pacifists , Brown and fellow abolitionists believed the time had come to fight slavery with violence .	0	history
 2340 . Douglas portrayed the Republican Party as an abolitionist effort — one that aimed to bring about miscegenation , or race - mixing through sexual relations or marriage .	1	history
 The “ black Republicans , ” Douglas declared , posed a dangerous threat to the Constitution .	0	history
 2343 . In October 1859 , the radical abolitionist John Brown and eighteen armed men , both blacks and whites , attacked the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry , Virginia .	0	history
 They hoped to capture the weapons there and distribute them among slaves to begin a massive uprising that would bring an end to slavery .	0	history
 2346 . Indeed , by the time of the Corwin amendment ’s passage through Congress , Confederate forces in the Deep South had already begun to take over federal forts .	0	history
 The loss of Fort Sumter , in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina , proved to be the flashpoint in the contest between the new Confederacy and the federal government .	0	history
 A small Union garrison of fewer than one hundred soldiers and officers held the fort , making it a vulnerable target for the Confederacy .	0	history
 2349 . General George B. McClellan , the general in chief of the army , responsible for overall control of Union land forces , proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the Confederates .	0	history
 In direct command of the Army of the Potomac , the Union fighting force operating outside Washington , DC , McClellan believed , incorrectly , that Confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle .	0	history
 His cautious nature made him popular with his men but not with the president or Congress .	0	history
 2352 . By late 1862 , the course of the war had changed to take on the characteristics of total war , in which armies attempt to demoralize the enemy by both striking military targets and disrupting their opponent ’s ability to wage war through destruction of their resources .	1	history
 In this type of war , armies often make no distinction between civilian and military targets .	0	history
 2355 . A Union campaign to convince individuals to buy the bonds helped increase sales .	0	history
 The Republicans also passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862 , calling for paper money — known as greenbacks — to be printed [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Some $ 150 million worth of greenbacks became legal tender , and the Northern economy boomed , although high inflation also resulted .	0	history
 2358 . After the featured orator had delivered a two - hour speech , Lincoln addressed the crowd for several minutes .	0	history
 In his speech , known as the Gettysburg Address , which he had finished writing while a guest in David Wills’ home the day before the dedication , Lincoln invoked the Founding Fathers and the spirit of the American Revolution .	0	history
 The Union soldiers who had died at Gettysburg , he proclaimed , had died not only to preserve the Union , but also to guarantee freedom and equality for all .	0	history
 2361 . Northern Democrats railed against Lincoln and the war .	0	history
 Republicans labeled these vocal opponents of the President Copperheads , a term that many antiwar Democrats accepted .	0	history
 As the anti - Lincoln poster below illustrates , his enemies tried to paint him as an untrustworthy and suspect leader ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2364 . However , the proposal instantly drew fire from a larger faction of Republicans in Congress who did not want to deal moderately with the South .	1	history
 These members of Congress , known as Radical Republicans , wanted to remake the South and punish the rebels .	0	history
 Radical Republicans insisted on harsh terms for the defeated Confederacy and protection for former slaves , going far beyond what the president proposed .	0	history
 2367 . However , they faced the wrath of defeated but un - reconciled southerners who were determined to keep blacks an impoverished and despised underclass .	0	history
 Recognizing the widespread devastation in the South and the dire situation of freed people , Congress created the Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands in March 1865 , popularly known as the Freedmen ’s Bureau .	0	history
 Lincoln had approved of the bureau , giving it a charter for one year .	0	history
 2370 . However , Congress mustered the necessary votes to override his veto .	0	history
 Despite the Civil Rights Act , the black codes endured , forming the foundation of the racially discriminatory Jim Crow segregation policies that impoverished generations of African Americans .	0	history
 2373 . Black voter registration in the late 1860s and the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment finally brought what Lincoln had characterized as “ a new birth of freedom . ” Union Leagues , fraternal groups founded in the North that promoted loyalty to the Union and the Republican Party during the Civil War , expanded into the South after the war and were transformed into political clubs that served both political and civic functions .	1	history
 As centers of the black communities in the South , the leagues became vehicles for the dissemination of information , acted as mediators between members of the black community and the white establishment , and served other practical functions like helping to build schools and churches for the community they served .	0	history
 2376 . Paramilitary white - supremacist terror organizations in the South helped bring about the collapse of Reconstruction , using violence as their primary weapon .	0	history
 The “ Invisible Empire of the South , ” or Ku Klux Klan , stands as the most notorious .	0	history
 The Klan was founded in 1866 as an oath - bound fraternal order of Confederate veterans in Tennessee , with former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest as its first leader .	0	history
 2379 . Congress also passed a series of three laws designed to stamp out the Klan .	0	history
 Passed in 1870 and 1871 , the Enforcement Acts or “ Force Acts ” were designed to outlaw intimidation at the polls and to give the federal government the power to prosecute crimes against freed people in federal rather than state courts .	1	history
 Congress believed that this last step , a provision in the third Enforcement Act , also called the Ku Klux Klan Act , was necessary in order to ensure that trials would not be decided by white juries in southern states friendly to the Klan .	0	history
 2382 . The concept of Manifest Destiny found its roots in the long - standing traditions of territorial expansion upon which the nation itself was founded .	0	history
 This phrase , which implies divine encouragement for territorial expansion , was coined by magazine editor John O’Sullivan in 1845 , when he wrote in the United States Magazine and Democratic Review that “ it was our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our multiplying millions . ” Although the context of O’Sullivan ’s original article was to encourage expansion into the newly acquired Texas territory , the spirit it invoked would subsequently be used to encourage westward settlement throughout the rest of the nineteenth century .	1	history
 2385 . The first houses built by western settlers were typically made of mud and sod with thatch roofs , as there was little timber for building .	0	history
 Rain , when it arrived , presented constant problems for these sod houses , with mud falling into food , and vermin , most notably lice , scampering across bedding ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Weather patterns not only left the fields dry , they also brought tornadoes , droughts , blizzards , and insect swarms .	0	history
 2388 . In 1859 , Henry T. P. Comstock , a Canadian - born fur trapper , began gold mining in Nevada with other prospectors but then quickly found a blue - colored vein that proved to be the first significant silver discovery in the United States .	0	history
 Within twenty years , the Comstock Lode , as it was called , yielded more than $ 300 million in shafts that reached hundreds of feet into the mountain .	0	history
 Subsequent mining in Arizona and Montana yielded copper , and , while it lacked the glamour of gold , these deposits created huge wealth for those who exploited them , particularly with the advent of copper wiring for the delivery of electricity and telegraph communication .	0	history
 2391 . The final episode in the so - called Indian Wars occurred in 1890 , at the Battle of Wounded Knee in South Dakota .	0	history
 On their reservation , the Sioux had begun to perform the “ Ghost Dance , ” which told of an Indian Messiah who would deliver the tribe from its hardship , with such frequency that white settlers began to worry that another uprising would occur .	1	history
 2394 . One of the greatest advancements was the telephone , which Alexander Graham Bell patented in 1876 ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 While he was not the first to invent the concept , Bell was the first one to capitalize on it ; after securing the patent , he worked with financiers and businessmen to create the National Bell Telephone Company .	0	history
 2397 . Carnegie ’s famous essay , The Gospel of Wealth , featured below , expounded on his beliefs .	0	history
 In it , he borrowed from Herbert Spencer ’s theory of social Darwinism , which held that society developed much like plant or animal life through a process of evolution in which the most fit and capable enjoyed the greatest material and social success .	1	history
 2400 . tolerated the presence of the most gigantic , the most cruel , impudent , pitiless and grasping monopoly that ever fastened itself upon a country.”Seeking still more control , Rockefeller recognized the advantages of controlling the transportation of his product .	0	history
 He next began to grow his company through vertical integration , wherein a company handles all aspects of a product ’s lifecycle , from the creation of raw materials through the production process to the delivery of the final product .	1	history
 In Rockefeller ’s case , this model required investment and acquisition of companies involved in everything from barrel - making to pipelines , tanker cars to railroads .	0	history
 2403 . This solitary and repetitive work style was a difficult adjustment for those used to more collaborative and skill - based work , whether on farms or in crafts shops .	0	history
 Managers embraced Fredrick Taylor ’s principles of scientific management , also called “ stop - watch management , ” where he used stop - watch studies to divide manufacturing tasks into short , repetitive segments .	1	history
 A mechanical engineer by training , Taylor encouraged factory owners to seek efficiency and profitability over any benefits of personal interaction .	0	history
 2406 . Urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the United States for a number of reasons .	0	history
 The new technologies of the time led to a massive leap in industrialization , requiring large numbers of workers .	0	history
 2409 . The primary form of relief for working - class urban Americans , and particularly immigrants , came in the form of machine politics .	0	history
 This phrase referred to the process by which every citizen of the city , no matter their ethnicity or race , was a ward resident with an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall .	1	history
 2412 . These included more expensive excursions , such as vacations in Newport , Rhode Island , winter relocation to sunny Florida , and frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe .	0	history
 For those who were not of the highly respected “ old money , ” but only recently obtained their riches through business ventures , the relief they sought came in the form of one book — the annual Social Register .	0	history
 First published in 1886 by Louis Keller in New York City , the register became a directory of the wealthy socialites who populated the city .	1	history
 4918 . To build a useful macroeconomic model , we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level .	1	economic
 This model is called the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model .	0	economic
 This module will explain aggregate supply , aggregate demand , and the equilibrium between them .	0	economic
 4921 . If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right .	0	economic
 At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions .	1	economic
 At these relatively low levels of output , levels of unemployment are high , and many factories are running only part - time , or have closed their doors .	0	economic
 4924 . This demand is determined by a number of factors , but one of them is the price level — recall though , that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy .	1	economic
 The aggregate demand ( AD ) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level .	1	economic
 [ link ] presents an aggregate demand ( AD ) curve .	0	economic
 Just like the aggregate supply curve , the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level .	0	economic
 4927 . In the long run , however , producers are limited to producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 4930 . Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .	1	economic
 One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita .	0	economic
 Over time , productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output .	0	economic
 4933 . The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month .	0	economic
 The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu , which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels .	0	economic
 4939 . The AD / AS model can be used to illustrate both Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law that demand creates its own supply .	0	economic
 Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in [ link ] : the Keynesian zone , the neoclassical zone , and the intermediate zone . Keynes , Neoclassical , and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium Ek , in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve , small shifts in AD , either to the right or the left , will affect the output level Yk , but will not much affect the price level .	0	economic
 4942 . Finally , consider the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve in [ link ] .	0	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei , then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions .	0	economic
 4945 . The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .	0	economic
 Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap , with its attendant unemployment , for a significant period of time . In the same way ( though not shown in the figure ) , if AD increases , the economy could experience an inflationary gap , where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output .	1	economic
 As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .	0	economic
 4948 . Disposable income : For most people , the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take - home pay , also known as disposable income , which is income after taxes .	1	economic
 4954 . Instead , prices and wages are “ sticky , ” making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP .	0	economic
 Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky : the coordination argument .	0	economic
 This argument points out that , even if most people would be willing — at least hypothetically — to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline , a market - oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions .	1	economic
 4957 . A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier .	0	economic
 The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP , but that spending is powerful .	1	economic
 4960 . The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation .	0	economic
 Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation , which became known as a Phillips curve .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows a theoretical Phillips curve , and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States .	0	economic
 4963 . Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right .	1	economic
 For example , if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf , where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment .	0	economic
 4969 . This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .	0	economic
 Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run	0	economic
 4975 . One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed .	0	economic
 The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can , using all information available to them .	1	economic
 In an economy where most people have rational expectations , economic adjustments may happen very quickly .	0	economic
 4978 . As inflation fluctuates , so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods .	0	economic
 The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate , plus an expected inflation factor .	1	economic
 Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy .	0	economic
 4981 . Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?As explained in Unemployment , unemployment can be divided into two categories : cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment , which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment .	1	economic
 Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP — giving potential employers less incentive to hire .	1	economic
 4984 . Each approach , Keynesian and neoclassical , has its strengths and weaknesses . The short - term Keynesian model , built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity , does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls .	1	economic
 By focusing on the short - run adjustments of aggregate demand , Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long - term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 4987 . The discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics .	0	economic
 At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .	0	economic
 We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .	0	economic
 4990 . Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .	1	economic
 In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .	1	economic
 For example , if an accountant wants a pair of shoes , this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services .	0	economic
 4993 . This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value .	0	economic
 In an economy with inflation , money loses some buying power each year , but it remains money . Third , money serves as a unit of account , which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured .	0	economic
 For example , an accountant may charge $ 100 to file your tax return .	0	economic
 4996 . Gold , silver , cowrie shells , cigarettes , and even cocoa beans have been used as money .	0	economic
 Although these items are used as commodity money , they also have a value from use as something other than money .	0	economic
 Gold , for example , has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes .	0	economic
 4999 . Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money , economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity .	0	economic
 Liquidity refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service .	1	economic
 For example , cash is very liquid .	0	economic
 5002 . M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .	1	economic
 Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .	0	economic
 These are the amounts held in checking accounts .	1	economic
 5005 . Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	1	economic
 Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .	1	economic
 In short , all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend , but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 [ link ] should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2 .	0	economic
 5008 . Until you pay the credit card bill , you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company .	0	economic
 With a smart card , you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases .	0	economic
 Some “ smart cards ” used for specific purposes , like long - distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria , are not really all that smart , because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places . In short , credit cards , debit cards , and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made .	0	economic
 5011 . Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .	0	economic
 Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money .	1	economic

 Because of the two - column format of the balance sheet , with the T - shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “ Assets ” and “ Liabilities , ” it is sometimes called a T - account .	0	economic
 5023 . These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset : The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future .	0	economic
 In our example , the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $ 4 million . The final entry under assets is reserves , which is money that the bank keeps on hand , and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds — and thus does not lead to interest payments .	1	economic
 The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “ reserve , ” which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank .	0	economic
 5026 . The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank ’s liabilities , namely the deposits of its customers , can be withdrawn quickly , but many of the bank ’s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades . This asset - liability time mismatch — a bank ’s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term — can cause severe problems for a bank .	0	economic
 For example , imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate , but then sees interest rates rise substantially .	0	economic

 In Money and Banking , we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves .	0	economic
 “ On hand ” is a bit of a misnomer because , while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank , the majority are held in the bank ’s account at the Federal Reserve , and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors .	0	economic

As a result of the Panic , the Federal Reserve was founded to be the “ lender of last resort . ” In the event of a bank run , sound banks , ( banks that were not bankrupt ) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed ’s discount “ window ” to quell the bank run . The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate .	1	economic

 This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .	1	economic
 5065 . Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .	0	economic
 The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .	0	economic

 5071 . If velocity is constant over time , then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left - hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP — although this change could happen through an increase in inflation , or an increase in real GDP , or some combination of the two .	0	economic

 A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals .	0	economic

 The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe , which dates back to the 1970s , is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs .

 4938 . In many of the national economies across Europe , the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10 % or a bit lower , even in good economic years .	0	economic
 This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market .	1	economic
 Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy .	1	economic
 4941 . Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side .	0	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy .	0	economic

 Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital .	1	economic
 4953 . First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand .	1	economic
 We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed .	1	economic
 4956 . In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level .	1	economic
 For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales .	0	economic

 Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework .	0	economic
 4962 . The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation .	0	economic
 In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears .	0	economic
 Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift .	0	economic
 4965 . In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern .	0	economic
 The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left .	0	economic
 The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment .	0	economic
 4968 . The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?	0	economic
 This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .	0	economic
 Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run	0	economic
 4971 . Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done .	1	economic
 Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software .	0	economic
 4974 . Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical .	0	economic
 In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy .	0	economic
 4977 . Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work .	1	economic
 Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion .	1	economic
 After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later .	0	economic
 4980 . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation .	0	economic
 The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T]here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”	0	economic

 Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :	0	economic
 4989 . Economies without money typically engage in the barter system .	0	economic
 Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .	1	economic
 In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .	1	economic
 4992 . Second , money must serve as a store of value .	0	economic
 In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services .	0	economic
 4995 . Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future .	1	economic
 So money serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment .	1	economic
 4998 . As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome .	0	economic
 Countries moved towards the use of fiat money .	0	economic
 Fiat money has no intrinsic value , but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country .	1	economic
 5001 . There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .	1	economic
 Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .	0	economic
 5004 . For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	1	economic
 Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .	1	economic
 5007 . It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 Although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you .	0	economic
 When you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller , and at the end of the month , the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month .	0	economic
 5010 . Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets .	1	economic
 Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .	0	economic
 5013 . Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	1	economic
 All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool , which is then loaned out .	0	economic
 5016 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 For example , the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition .	0	economic
 5019 . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	0	economic
 A bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital .	1	economic
 A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults , monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to customers , and bonds .	1	economic
 5022 . The second category of bank asset is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and nonprofit organizations .	1	economic
 A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the U.S. government .	0	economic
 5025 . The bank will be more willing to make what are called “ subprime loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down - payment , little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that .	1	economic
 Some subprime loans made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income , No Job , or Assets . These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities — but with a twist .	0	economic
 The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage - backed securities , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , 5 % of such losses .	0	economic
 5028 . Fortunately , a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system .	0	economic
 The money multiplier formula is :	0	economic
 5031 . Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England .	0	economic
 In the United States , the central bank is called the Federal Reserve — often abbreviated as just “ the Fed . ” This section explains the organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank .	1	economic
 5034 . Bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk .	1	economic
 Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .	0	economic
 5037 . They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .	1	economic
 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .	0	economic
 5040 . In this situation , whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough , lost their money .	0	economic
 Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run .	1	economic
 In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .	0	economic
 5043 . To prevent this , the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else .	1	economic
 This is known as the lender of last resort role .	0	economic
 For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money .	0	economic
 5046 . The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations .	1	economic
 The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors .	0	economic
 5049 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5052 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 5055 . If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential GDP , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .	0	economic
 5058 . [ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades .	0	economic
 The graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market operations ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since 1975 .	0	economic
 Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure .	0	economic
 5061 . Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .	0	economic
 First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills .	1	economic
 In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .	0	economic
 5064 . If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans .	0	economic
 Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .	0	economic
 The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .	0	economic
 5067 . Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used .	0	economic
 Consider the velocity of M1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances .	0	economic
 In 2009 , for example , M1 was $ 1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $ 14.3 trillion , so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ( $ 14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion ) .	0	economic
 5070 . This equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form .	0	economic
 This equation must hold true , by definition .	0	economic
 5073 . In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate .	0	economic
 These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central bankers , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects .	0	economic
 5076 . This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low .	1	economic
 By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .	0	economic
 5079 . One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .	0	economic
 For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .	1	economic
 The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .	0	economic
 5082 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 In good economic times , this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth .	0	economic
 5085 . Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor .	0	economic
 For example , Ecuador , El Salvador , and Panama have decided to dollarize — that is , to use the U.S. dollar as their currency .	1	economic
 Sometimes nations share a common currency .	0	economic
 5088 . In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa .	0	economic
 To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership .	0	economic
 Let ’s consider these categories in turn .	0	economic
 5091 . Let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is .	0	economic
 You can hedge , which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) .	1	economic
 Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time .	0	economic
 5094 . When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different .	0	economic
 When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening.”To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) .	1	economic
 The vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ 1 in U.S. currency , measured in terms of Canadian currency .	0	economic
 5097 . In the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars .	0	economic
 What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ?	0	economic
 The answer to this question is discussed in the following section .	0	economic
 5100 . The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods .	1	economic
 5103 . Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency .	0	economic
 As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole .	0	economic
 5106 . Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers .	0	economic
 When most of a country ’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously , a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results .	0	economic
 Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy .	0	economic
 5109 . In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % .	0	economic
 ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS ) The line 's variations represent the volatility of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5112 . A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies .	0	economic
 5115 . Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation .	0	economic
 Alternatively , Brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 5118 . Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market .	0	economic
 If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .	0	economic
 Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .	0	economic
 5121 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .	1	economic
 For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .	0	economic
 5124 . A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency .	1	economic
 A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether .	0	economic
 5127 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	1	economic
 All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government .	0	economic
 5130 . Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes .	0	economic
 5133 . Together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80 % of federal tax revenues in 2014 .	0	economic
 Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases .	1	economic
 Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .	0	economic
 5136 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5139 . As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts .	0	economic
 These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .	0	economic
 5142 . Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .	0	economic
 5145 . The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom .	1	economic
 5148 . Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates .	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % .	1	economic
 5151 . Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time .	0	economic
 The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag .	1	economic
 Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .	0	economic
 5154 . Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities .	0	economic
 The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy .	1	economic
 5157 . The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal .	0	economic
 However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit .	0	economic
 For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits .	0	economic
 5160 . How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP .	0	economic
 However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 .	0	economic
 5163 . If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment . However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity .	0	economic
 5166 . The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772–1823 ) .	1	economic
 If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .	0	economic
 5169 . First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey .	0	economic
 If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros . The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession .	0	economic
 Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997–1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 .	0	economic
 5172 . For example , life expectancy at birth in many low - income regions approximates those who are more affluent .	0	economic
 The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living .	0	economic
 For instance , despite very high income levels , there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America .	0	economic
 5175 . The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore .	1	economic
 The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan , although these are often treated under international law as part of China , rather than as separate countries .	0	economic
 5178 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .	0	economic
 The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5181 . In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution . However , the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp .	0	economic
 5184 . Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent .	0	economic
 It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies .	1	economic
 5187 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports exceed its exports .	0	economic
 In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .	0	economic
 5190 . It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , shifting the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left .	0	economic
 The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession .	0	economic
 People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy , with its great size , is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets .	0	economic
 5193 . World War I severed many economic connections .	0	economic
 During the Great Depression of the 1930s , many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others .	0	economic
 World War II further hindered international trade .	0	economic
 5196 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .	0	economic
 The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .	0	economic
 5199 . The United States produces / consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn .	0	economic
 Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .	0	economic
 With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .	0	economic
 5202 . Then , in the numerical example given , Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators .	0	economic
 Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade .	0	economic
 Mexico will be unambiguously better off .	0	economic
 5205 . What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?	0	economic
 There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale .	0	economic
 5208 . A second broad reason that intra - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale .	0	economic
 The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens .	0	economic
 5211 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .	1	economic
 Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .	0	economic
 Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .	0	economic
 5214 . Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services .	0	economic
 They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .	0	economic
 5217 . ( We ’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter . )	0	economic
 This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world .	0	economic
 It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , quotas , and nontariff barriers .	1	economic
 4919 . Profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs , like labor or raw materials , the firm needs to buy .	0	economic
 Aggregate supply ( AS ) refers to the total quantity of output ( i.e .	1	economic
 real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .	1	economic
 4922 . When an economy is operating at its potential GDP , machines and factories are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 For this reason , potential GDP is sometimes also called full - employment GDP .	0	economic
 4925 . The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world .	0	economic
 U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .	0	economic
 U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .	0	economic
 4928 . For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 4931 . For example , the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975 , 1980–1982 , 1990–91 , 2001 , and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices .	0	economic
 In the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation . Conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs .	0	economic
 From 1985 to 1986 , for example , the average price of crude oil fell by almost half , from $ 24 a barrel to $ 12 a barrel .	0	economic
 4934 . If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion . Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too .	0	economic
 Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to diminish it .	0	economic
 Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment .	0	economic
 4937 . Two types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter .	0	economic
 Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short - run movements of GDP .	1	economic
 Over the long run , in the United States , the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5 % ( give or take one percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy .	0	economic
 4940 . Focus first on the Keynesian zone , that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat .	1	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow .	0	economic
 4943 . The idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell .	0	economic
 Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy .	1	economic
 This point is illustrated in [ link].The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output .	0	economic
 4946 . As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .	0	economic
 The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services .	1	economic
 ( Aggregate demand ( AD ) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure .	0	economic
 4949 . Spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure .	1	economic
 Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) .	0	economic
 4952 . ) Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects .	1	economic
 The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks .	0	economic
 First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 4955 . Second , frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected .	1	economic
 These costs of changing prices are called menu costs — like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant .	0	economic
 Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time .	0	economic
 4958 . Thus , when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP .	0	economic
 The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .	0	economic
 4961 . Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 This pattern became known as stagflation .	0	economic
 ( Recall from The Aggregate Demand / Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation . )	1	economic
 4964 . He proposed that the government could bury money underground , and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again .	0	economic
 These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP .	0	economic
 4967 . The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output .	0	economic
 4970 . Actual or real GDP is benchmarked against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing .	0	economic
 Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 4973 . Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand .	0	economic
 Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right .	0	economic
 4976 . After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works .	0	economic
 An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory .	1	economic
 If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut .	0	economic
 4979 . The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve .	0	economic
 The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run .	0	economic
 4982 . Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment .	0	economic
 Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low .	0	economic
 4985 . However , the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years .	0	economic
 Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s .	0	economic
 Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment .	0	economic
 4988 . At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .	0	economic
 We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .	0	economic
 With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing .	1	economic
 4991 . ( We will get to its definition soon . )	0	economic
 First , money serves as a medium of exchange , which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller .	0	economic
 Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes , the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money .	0	economic
 4994 . Finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment .	0	economic
 This means that if money is usable today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future .	1	economic
 4997 . Of course , gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry . As commodity money , gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account .	0	economic
 Commodity - backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank .	1	economic
 During much of its history , the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver .	0	economic
 5000 . less liquid . The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity .	1	economic
 There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 5003 . A broader definition of money , M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits .	0	economic
 For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	0	economic
 5006 . Where does “ plastic money ” like debit cards , credit cards , and smart money fit into this picture ?	0	economic
 A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller .	1	economic
 It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 5009 . One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts .	0	economic
 Indeed , the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system .	0	economic
 The next section explains how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money .	0	economic
 5012 . Banks as Financial IntermediariesAn “ intermediary ” is one who stands between two other parties .	1	economic
 Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	0	economic
 5015 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 5018 . In this case , a home is the asset , but the mortgage is the liability .	0	economic
 The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed ( the liability ) . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	1	economic
 5021 . Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments .	0	economic
 The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market . One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?	1	economic
 The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid , the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan .	0	economic
 5024 . Securitization offers certain advantages .	0	economic
 If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments .	0	economic
 5027 . Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers . How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset - liability time mismatch ?	0	economic
 One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans , which means lending to a variety of customers .	1	economic
 For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area .	0	economic
 5030 . The organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation ’s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank .	1	economic
 Most nations have central banks or currency boards .	0	economic
 5033 . A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 The goal is not only to protect individuals’ savings , but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself .	0	economic
 5036 . Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks .	0	economic
 They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .	1	economic
 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 5039 . The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always straightforward .	0	economic
 As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid .	1	economic
 These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan . The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off .	0	economic
 5042 . About 70 countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs .	0	economic
 In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is responsible for deposit insurance .	1	economic
 Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC .	0	economic
 5045 . The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations .	0	economic
 Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates .	1	economic
 5048 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5051 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 5054 . Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time .	0	economic
 In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise .	0	economic
 5057 . In [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) occurs at an output of 750 , which is above potential GDP .	0	economic
 A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings .	1	economic
 Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens .	0	economic
 5060 . With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .	0	economic
 This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .	1	economic
 5063 . Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit .	0	economic
 For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans .	0	economic
 5066 . Unpredictable Movements of VelocityVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy .	1	economic
 The velocity of money in a year is defined as :	0	economic
 5069 . Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate .	0	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and there is deflation of 2 % , then the real interest rate is actually 9 % .	0	economic
 5072 . So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 .	0	economic
 Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking , M2 is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1 .	0	economic
 5075 . In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .	0	economic
 If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment .	0	economic
 From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy .	0	economic
 5078 . Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .	0	economic
 For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment .	0	economic
 5081 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 5084 . This chapter discusses the international dimension of money , which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate .	0	economic
 An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand .	1	economic
 The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5087 . You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters .	0	economic
 In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies .	0	economic
 These earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature .	0	economic
 5090 . The other kind of international financial investment , portfolio investment , involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility .	1	economic
 An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom , or deposited money in a British bank .	0	economic
 5093 . These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .	0	economic
 This is called the interbank market .	0	economic
 5096 . The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos .	0	economic
 Note that the two exchange rates are inverses : 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso ( or $ 0.10 per peso ) .	0	economic
 5099 . If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars .	0	economic
 This is known as arbitrage , the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit .	1	economic
 It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries .	0	economic
 5102 . A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country .	0	economic
 Let ’s discuss these scenarios in turn . Exchange Rates , Aggregate Demand , and Aggregate Supply	0	economic
 5105 . In 1997–1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more .	0	economic
 These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital , with bank lending increasing by 20 % to 30 % per year through the mid-1990s .	0	economic
 When their exchange rates depreciated , the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt .	0	economic
 5108 . A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate .	1	economic
 The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate , as are the currencies of about 40 % of the countries in the world economy .	0	economic
 5111 . When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency .	1	economic
 A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 5114 . The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency .	0	economic
 In this way , it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency .	0	economic
 5117 . For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg .	0	economic
 With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate .	0	economic
 With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg .	0	economic
 5120 . Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment .	0	economic
 5123 . But proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties .	0	economic
 Taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones .	0	economic
 5126 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5129 . When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .	1	economic
 Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 5132 . When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .	0	economic
 The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue . The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .	0	economic
 Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time .	0	economic
 5135 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5138 . The federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue .	0	economic
 It imposes an excise tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .	1	economic
 As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 5141 . Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits .	0	economic
 The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows the ratio of debt / GDP since 1940 .	0	economic
 5144 . The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries .	0	economic
 Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels .	1	economic
 The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 5147 . In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past .	0	economic
 On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ” The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”This happy consensus , however , did not last .	0	economic
 The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 .	0	economic
 5150 . It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip .	0	economic
 The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag .	1	economic
 After this lag , policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills .	0	economic
 5153 . Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement .	0	economic
 After all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers .	0	economic
 5156 . The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded . The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings . Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .	1	economic
 5159 . If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .	0	economic
 When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out . To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .	1	economic
 In 2005 , for example , the budget deficit was roughly 4 % of GDP .	0	economic
 5162 . Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment .	0	economic
 If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 5165 . Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education .	0	economic
 If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role .	0	economic
 5168 . Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar , measured in euros .	0	economic
 At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s ) .	0	economic

 As explained in The Macroeconomic Perspective , we must consider using purchasing power parity or “ international dollars ” to convert average incomes into comparable units .	0	economic
 Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries . The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution .	0	economic
 5174 . Where does economic growth come from ?	0	economic
 According to most economists who believe in the growth consensus , economic growth ( as discussed in Economic Growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements .	0	economic
 In turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all interacting in a market - driven economy .	0	economic
 5177 . Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital .	0	economic
 Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty . For example , the average citizen of Burundi , the lowest - income country , subsists on $ 150 per year ( adjusted to 2005 dollars ) .	0	economic
 According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop .	0	economic
 5180 . The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 5183 . Policymakers of the high - income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation .	0	economic
 First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term .	0	economic
 5186 . There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns .	0	economic

 Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government

 Thus , even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the mother , the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases .

 6484 . At its most basic level , being a member of the party - in - the - electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party .	0	government
 These voters are often called party identifiers , since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party , and they may attend some party events or functions .	0	government
 Party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season .	0	government
 6487 . Second , the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office .	0	government

 6505 . The first advance came with the introduction of the “ one - person - one - vote ” principle by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 .	0	government
 Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	0	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government
 6508 . Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles ( 1970–1972 and 1980–1982 ) .	0	government
 Map designers , no longer certain how to protect individual party members , changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by a comfortable margin .	0	government

 This ensures that after all amending and modifying has occurred , the two houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they send to the president .	0	government
 6586 . Attempts at African American disenfranchisement continued until the civil rights struggle of the 1960s finally brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .	0	government
 The act cleared several final hurdles to voter registration and voting for African Americans .	0	government
 6589 . An enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the Constitution .	1	government
 An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .	1	government
 6592 . These include Congress ’s sole power to introduce legislation , the Senate ’s final say on many presidential nominations and treaties signed by the president , and the House ’s ability to impeach or formally accuse the president or other federal officials of wrongdoing ( the first step in removing the person from office ; the second step , trial and removal , takes place in the U.S. Senate ) .	0	government
 Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch .	0	government
 The fact that Congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce .	0	government
 6595 . In the early days of the republic , Congress ’s role was rarely if ever disputed .	0	government
 However , with its decision in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court asserted its authority over judicial review and assumed the power to declare laws unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) .	1	government
 Yet , even after that decision , the Court was reluctant to use this power and did n’t do so for over half a century .	0	government
 Initially , the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature .	0	government
 6598 . His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .	0	government
 As a result , Congress attempted to restrain the power of the presidency by proposing the Twenty - Second Amendment to the Constitution , which limited a president to only two full terms in office . David M. Jordan .	0	government

 Another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of World War II , but then Congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades .	0	government
 That lull ended in the early 1970s when the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed .	0	government
 Among other things , it created the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it , limited individual contributions , and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns .	0	government
 6604 . In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .	0	government
 A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .	0	government
 6607 . Political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption , however .	0	government
 In 1960 , political scientist Angus Campbell proposed the surge - and - decline theory to explain these patterns . Angus Campbell .	0	government
 1960 . 6610 .	0	government
 These are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders .	0	government
 The minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position .	0	government
 As the official leader of the opposition , he or she technically holds the rank closest to that of the Speaker , makes strategy decisions , and attempts to keep order within the minority .	0	government
 6613 . Apart from this and very few other exceptions , the president of the Senate does not actually operate in the Senate .	0	government
 Instead , the Constitution allows for the Senate to choose a president pro tempore — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who presides over the Senate .	0	government
 Despite the title , the job is largely a formal and powerless role .	0	government
 6616 . However , joint committees have no bill - referral authority whatsoever — they are informational only .	0	government
 A conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the House and the Senate .	1	government
 The conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the House and Senate in different forms .	0	government
 6619 . Once legislation has been proposed , however , the majority leadership consults with the parliamentarian about which committee to send it to .	0	government
 Each chamber has a parliamentarian , an advisor , typically a trained lawyer , who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber .	1	government
 6622 . After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common .	0	government
 Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate .	0	government
 To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .	0	government
 6625 . But they have largely been overshadowed by the outright ridiculous and sometimes racist filibusters of the twentieth century .	0	government
 In the first category , the fifteen - and - a - half - hour marathon of Senator Huey Long of Louisiana stands out : Hoping to retain the need for Senate confirmation of some jobs he wanted to keep from his political enemies , Long spent much of his filibuster analyzing the Constitution , talking about his favorite recipes , and telling amusing stories , as was his custom .	0	government
 6628 . Hitching a Ride : Omnibus Legislating in the U.S. Congress .	0	government
 Columbus , OH : Ohio State University Press .	0	government
 Creating and voting for an omnibus bill allows Congress to quickly accomplish policy changes that would have taken many votes and the expending of great political capital over a long period of time .	0	government
 This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy .	0	government
 6631 . Therefore , they ( and their staff members ) rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals , as well as about fellow lawmakers’ stands and constituents’ perceptions .	0	government
 These voting cues give lawmakers an indication of how to vote on issues , particularly those with which they are unfamiliar .	0	government
 But lawmakers also rely on lobbyists for information about ideas they can champion and that will benefit them when they run for reelection . Wright , Interest Groups and Congress : Lobbying , Contributions , and Influence .	0	government

 Political scientists call this the politico model of representation .	0	government
 In it , members of Congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served , the constituency or the nation .	1	government
 6640 . Many advances in women ’s rights have been the result of women ’s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government , especially since the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Women ’s Political Caucus ( NWPC ) in 1971 .	0	government
 The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .	0	government
 For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .	0	government
 6643 . In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement , African American representatives also began to enter Congress in increasing numbers .	0	government
 In 1971 , to better represent their interests , these representatives founded the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) , an organization that grew out of a Democratic select committee formed in 1969 .	0	government
 Founding members of the CBC include John Conyers ( D - MI ) , currently the longest - serving member of the House of Representatives , Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) , and Shirley Chisholm , a founder of the NWPC and the first African American woman to be elected to the House of Representatives ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6646 . The concept of collective representation describes the relationship between Congress and the United States as a whole .	1	government
 That is , it considers whether the institution itself represents the American people , not just whether a particular member of Congress represents his or her district .	0	government
 6649 . The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .	0	government
 The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .	0	government
 Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .	0	government

 While Article II also states that the term of office is four years and does not expressly limit the number of times a person might be elected president , after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times ( from 1932 to 1944 ) , the Twenty - Second Amendment was proposed and ratified , limiting the presidency to two four - year terms .	0	government
 6661 . In the wake of the Civil War , President Andrew Johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during Reconstruction .	0	government
 President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover - up of key information relating to the 1972 break - in at the Democratic Party ’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex .	0	government
 Nixon likely would have also been removed by the Senate , since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal .	0	government
 6664 . No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office , starting with George Washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers .	0	government
 For example , Washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties , consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch .	0	government
 Today , the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president ’s advisers.https://www.justice.gov/about ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 And , in 1793 , when it became important for the United States to take a stand in the evolving European conflicts between France and other European powers , especially Great Britain , Washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat - in - chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived .	0	government
 6667 . Concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office , Jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted Congress ’s tacit approval of his actions .	0	government
 James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	0	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 6670 . Of the many ways in which the chief executive ’s power grew over the first several decades , the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers .	0	government
 While Washington , Adams , and Jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars , it was President James K. Polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority .	0	government
 In 1846 , as the United States and Mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where Texas ’s southern border lay , Polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in Mexico .	0	government
 6673 . Later , however , as president himself , Lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the Confederate effort to seek independence for the Southern states .	0	government
 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government
 He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .	0	government
 6676 . Over the course of the twentieth century , presidents expanded and elaborated upon these powers .	0	government

 6685 . Neither Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the Republicans or the Democrats ( respectively ) at the outset .	0	government
 The outsider phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated , however , in the 2016 presidential nominating process , as those distrusted by the party establishment , such as Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , who never before held political office , raced ahead of party favorites like Jeb Bush early in the primary process ( [ link]).Senator Ted Cruz ( R - TX ) , though disliked by the party establishment , was able to rise to the top in the Iowa caucuses in 2016 because of his ability to reach the conservative base of the party .	0	government
 Ultimately , Cruz bowed out of the race when Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination in Indiana in early May 2016 .	0	government
 6688 . Early presidential elections , conducted along the lines of the original process outlined in the Constitution , proved unsatisfactory .	0	government
 So long as George Washington was a candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion .	0	government
 But it took some manipulation of the votes of electors to ensure that the second - place winner ( and thus the vice president ) did not receive the same number of votes .	0	government
 6691 . In several elections , such as in 1876 and 1888 , a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has claimed the presidency , including cases when the losing candidate secured a majority of the popular vote .	0	government
 A recent case was the 2000 election , in which Democratic nominee Al Gore won the popular vote , while Republican nominee George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and hence the presidency .	0	government
 The 2016 election brought another such irregularity as Donald Trump comfortably won the Electoral College by narrowly winning the popular vote in several states , while Hillary Clinton collected nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide .	0	government
 6694 . In the immediate aftermath of the election , the incoming and outgoing administrations work together to help facilitate the transfer of power .	0	government
 While the General Services Administration oversees the logistics of the process , such as office assignments , information technology , and the assignment of keys , prudent candidates typically prepare for a possible victory by appointing members of a transition team during the lead - up to the general election .	0	government
 The success of the team ’s actions becomes apparent on inauguration day , when the transition of power takes place in what is often a seamless fashion , with people evacuating their offices ( and the White House ) for their successors .	0	government
 6697 . In 2013 , President Barack Obama nominated former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel to run the Department of Defense .	0	government
 The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .	0	government
 6700 . The Republican Senate and Judiciary Committee will welcome a Trump nominee in early 2017.Other presidential selections are not subject to Senate approval , including the president ’s personal staff ( whose most important member is the White House chief of staff ) and various advisers ( most notably the national security adviser ) .	0	government

 911 . The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant .	1	biology
 A whorl of sepals ( collectively called the calyx ) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud .	1	biology
 Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs , although there are some exceptions .	0	biology
 917 . The ovary houses one or more ovules , each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .	1	biology
 Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 920 . The other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm , which is tissue that serves as a food reserve .	1	biology
 The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle , or small root , and one ( monocot ) or two ( dicot ) leaf - like organs called cotyledons .	1	biology
 This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms : the monocots and the eudicots .	0	biology
 923 . Monocots include grasses and lilies , and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group .	0	biology
 Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups .	1	biology
 They are categorized separately in many classification schemes .	0	biology
 926 . Explore this website for additional information on pollinators . More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma .	1	biology
 Consequently , plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators .	0	biology
 929 . Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action , from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species .	0	biology
 Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .	1	biology
 Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .	1	biology
 932 . The first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period , about 319 million years ago ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms , the first naked seed plants , which arose about 380 million years ago .	1	biology
 Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers ( cone bearers ) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues ; however , they still reproduced like ferns , releasing spores into the environment .	1	biology
 935 . Seed ferns ( [ link ] ) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures .	1	biology
 What makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule — the female gametophyte and associated tissues — which develops into a seed upon fertilization .	1	biology
 Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period .	0	biology
 941 . Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .	0	biology
 After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells , a 6–32-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed .	1	biology
 Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .	1	biology
 944 . Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .	1	biology
 These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called organogenesis .	1	biology
 950 . Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers ( triploblasts ) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm , called a coelom , and those that do not .	1	biology
 This epithelial cell - lined coelomic cavity represents a space , usually filled with fluid , which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall .	0	biology
 953 . A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm , which is found between the two layers .	1	biology
 Although still functional , these are considered false coeloms , and those animals are called pseudocoelomates .	0	biology
 The phylum Nematoda ( roundworms ) is an example of a pseudocoelomate .	0	biology
 956 . The mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation .	1	biology
 In later stages , a second opening forms , and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 959 . The earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote .	0	biology
 Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage , meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated , and thus misaligned , with respect to the cells of the opposite pole .	1	biology
 This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .	0	biology
 962 . A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type .	0	biology
 In contrast , deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage , in which cells are not yet pre - determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types .	1	biology
 These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells .	0	biology
 965 . Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	1	biology
 Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae , and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore .	0	biology
 968 . The Cambrian Explosion of Animal LifeThe Cambrian period , occurring between approximately 542–488 million years ago , marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth ’s history .	1	biology
 It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time , often referred to as the Cambrian explosion ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Echinoderms , mollusks , worms , arthropods , and chordates arose during this period .	0	biology
 971 . The invertebrates , or invertebrata , are animals that do not contain bony structures , such as the cranium and vertebrae .	1	biology
 The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans , which include only the phylum Porifera : the sponges ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Parazoans ( “ beside animals ” ) do not display tissue - level organization , although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions .	1	biology
 974 . While sponges ( excluding the hexactinellids ) do not exhibit tissue - layer organization , they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions .	0	biology
 Pinacocytes , which are epithelial - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly - like substance called mesohyl .	1	biology
 Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen - like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions .	1	biology
 977 . In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 In other sponges , ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge . Choanocytes ( “ collar cells ” ) are present at various locations , depending on the type of sponge , but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows ( the spongocoel in simple sponges , canals within the body wall in more complex sponges , and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges ) .	1	biology
 Whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge , choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl .	1	biology
 980 . An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules .	0	biology
 Gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted .	1	biology
 In gemmules , an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen ( spongin ) that may be reinforced by spicules .	0	biology
 983 . Animals in this phylum display two distinct morphological body plans : polyp or “ stalk ” and medusa or “ bell ” ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 An example of the polyp form is Hydra spp .	0	biology
 986 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .	1	biology
 The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .	0	biology
 989 . These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form .	0	biology
 The life cycle ( [ link ] ) of these animals can be described as polymorphic , because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle .	0	biology
 992 . Rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona .	0	biology
 The food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax ( pharynx with jaw - like structures ) .	1	biology
 Food then passes by digestive and salivary glands , and into the stomach , then onto the intestines .	0	biology
 995 . Eggs and sperm are released into the water , and fertilization occurs externally .	0	biology
 The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .	0	biology
 In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .	0	biology
 998 . Mollusk species that are exclusively aquatic have gills for respiration , whereas some terrestrial species have lungs for respiration .	0	biology
 Additionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .	1	biology
 The mantle ( also known as the pallium ) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks ; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell .	1	biology
 1001 . Calcareous spines may be present on the girdle to offer protection from predators .	0	biology
 Respiration is facilitated by ctenidia ( gills ) that are present ventrally .	0	biology
 These animals possess a radula that is modified for scraping .	0	biology
 1004 . The head is rudimentary and protrudes out of the posterior end of the shell .	0	biology
 These animals do not possess eyes , but they have a radula , as well as a foot modified into tentacles with a bulbous end , known as captaculae .	1	biology
 Captaculae serve to catch and manipulate prey .	0	biology
 1007 . The overall body can be divided into head , body , and pygidium ( or tail ) .	1	biology
 The clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus that aids in sperm transfer and gives rise to a cocoon within which fertilization occurs ; it appears as a fused band in the anterior third of the animal ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1010 . The name derives from the word ecdysis , which refers to the shedding , or molting , of the exoskeleton .	1	biology
 The phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies , which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size . Phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature .	1	biology
 The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word “ Nemos , ” which means “ thread ” and includes roundworms .	1	biology
 1013 . Crustaceans possess two pairs of antennae , mandibles as mouthparts , and biramous ( “ two branched ” ) appendages , which means that their legs are formed in two parts , as distinct from the uniramous ( “ one branched ” ) myriapods and hexapods ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1016 . Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .	0	biology
 A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1019 . These animals do not possess antennae .	0	biology
 The second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps .	1	biology
 In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .	0	biology
 1022 . These buds , known as coelomic pouches , fuse to form the coelomic cavity , as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer .	0	biology
 The resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom .	0	biology
 The archenteron develops into the alimentary canal , and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula .	0	biology
 1025 . Podocytes , cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids , are present near the center of echinoderms .	1	biology
 These podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to an opening called the madreporite .	1	biology
 1028 . The chordates are named for the notochord , which is a flexible , rod - shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species .	1	biology
 It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord , and provides skeletal support through the length of the body .	0	biology
 1031 . In tetrapods , the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils .	0	biology

 1052 . Amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods .	1	biology
 Amphibia includes frogs , salamanders , and caecilians .	0	biology
 The term amphibian loosely translates from the Greek as “ dual life , ” which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders undergo and their mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle .	0	biology
 1055 . Amphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world .	0	biology
 Amphibians can be divided into three clades : Urodela ( “ tailed - ones ” ) , the salamanders ; Anura ( “ tail - less ones ” ) , the frogs ; and Apoda ( “ legless ones ” ) , the caecilians .	1	biology
 1058 . The life cycle of frogs , as other amphibians , consists of two distinct stages : the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage .	1	biology
 The larval stage of a frog , the tadpole , is often a filter - feeding herbivore .	1	biology
 Tadpoles usually have gills , a lateral line system , long - finned tails , and lack limbs .	0	biology

 1079 . Sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates .	1	biology
 Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks .	1	biology
 Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns .	1	biology
 1082 . These allow side - to - side movement of the jaw , making chewing possible , which is unique to mammals .	0	biology
 Most mammals have heterodont teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth .	1	biology
 Most mammals are diphyodonts , meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime : deciduous or “ baby ” teeth , and permanent teeth .	1	biology

 1088 . Like mammals , which are also endothermic , birds have an insulating covering that keeps heat in the body : feathers .	1	biology
 Specialized feathers called down feathers are especially insulating , trapping air in spaces between each feather to decrease the rate of heat loss .	1	biology
 Certain parts of a bird ’s body are covered in down feathers , and the base of other feathers have a downy portion , whereas newly hatched birds are covered in down .	0	biology
 1091 . Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust .	1	biology
 Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .	1	biology
 1094 . Several modifications are found in birds to reduce body weight , including pneumatization of bones .	0	biology
 Pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow , rather than filled with tissue ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology

 1097 . During the Cretaceous period , a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Enantiornithes means “ opposite birds , ” which refers to the fact that certain bones of the feet are joined differently than the way the bones are joined in modern birds .	1	biology
 1100 . All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees , as they all descended from tree - dwellers .	0	biology
 This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation , or climbing and swinging through trees .	1	biology
 These adaptations include , but are not limited to : 1 ) a rotating shoulder joint , 2 ) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs , which are widely separated from fingers ( except humans ) , which allow for gripping branches , 3 ) stereoscopic vision , two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes , which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance .	1	biology

 The root system , which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals , is usually underground .	1	biology
 [ link ] shows the organ systems of a typical plant .	0	biology
 1118 . Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1121 . Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base ; for example , it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing .	1	biology
 1124 . The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In stems , the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle ; in roots , this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder . This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash ( Curcurbita maxima ) stem .	1	biology
 Each teardrop - shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside .	0	biology
 1127 . The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .	1	biology
 The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .	1	biology
 1130 . Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 They provide structural support , mainly to the stem and leaves .	0	biology
 1133 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis .	1	biology
 1136 . Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 The ( a ) colorized scanning - electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot .	0	biology
 1139 . Phloem tissue is composed of sieve - tube cells , companion cells , phloem parenchyma , and phloem fibers .	1	biology
 A series of sieve - tube cells ( also called sieve - tube elements ) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube , which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids .	1	biology
 The sugars flow from one sieve - tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates , which are found at the end junctions between two cells .	0	biology
 1142 . Some plants , especially those that are woody , also increase in thickness during their life span .	0	biology
 The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth , and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem .	1	biology
 Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant , and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem .	1	biology
 1145 . The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 In some plants , the periderm has many openings , known as lenticels , which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex , xylem and phloem .	0	biology
 1148 . Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	1	biology
 Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .	1	biology
 Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 1151 . Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	1	biology
 A bulb , which functions as an underground storage unit , is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem , as seen in the iris .	1	biology
 1154 . Most roots are underground .	0	biology
 Some plants , however , also have adventitious roots , which emerge above the ground from the shoot .	1	biology
 1157 . When the plant embryo emerges from the seed , the radicle of the embryo forms the root system .	0	biology
 The tip of the root is protected by the root cap , a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure .	1	biology
 The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil .	0	biology
 1160 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 The endodermis is exclusive to roots , and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root ’s vascular system .	0	biology
 1163 . Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .	1	biology
 Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 1166 . Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 Most leaves have a midrib , which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue .	1	biology
 1169 . In an opposite leaf arrangement , two leaves arise at the same point , with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch .	0	biology
 If there are three or more leaves connected at a node , the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled .	1	biology
 1172 . Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology

 ( common name “ umbrella plant ” ) .	0	biology
 1175 . Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water .	1	biology
 Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system , but are very interested in water movement between two systems .	0	biology
 1178 . Transpiration — the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata — is a passive process , meaning that metabolic energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement .	1	biology
 The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere .	0	biology
 1181 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	0	biology
 The points of sugar delivery , such as roots , young shoots , and developing seeds , are called sinks .	1	biology
 1184 . It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space .	0	biology

 1187 . The phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore , similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole light - absorbing head group of chlorophyll .	1	biology
 Phytochromes have two photo - interconvertible forms : Pr and Pfr .	0	biology
 1190 . Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight .	1	biology
 Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism , whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism .	1	biology
 1193 . Apical dominance — the inhibition of lateral bud formation — is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem .	1	biology
 Flowering , fruit setting and ripening , and inhibition of abscission ( leaf falling ) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins .	1	biology
 Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red / far - red responses .	0	biology
 1196 . The plant hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls .	1	biology
 However , more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process .	0	biology
 1199 . Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections .	1	biology
 They act locally at the site of injury , and can also be transported to other tissues .	0	biology
