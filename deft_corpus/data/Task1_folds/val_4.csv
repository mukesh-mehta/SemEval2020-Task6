 Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .	0	economic
 For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average .	0	economic

 4325 . Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory .	0	economic
 Strictly speaking , a theory is a more abstract representation , while a model is more applied or empirical representation .	0	economic
 4328 . There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy .	0	economic
 The first is the traditional economy , which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia , Africa , and South America .	0	economic
 4331 . The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .	0	economic
 In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .	0	economic
 One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods , services , and assets across national borders — in other words , international trade and financial capital flows .	0	economic
 Thus , the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country ’s total economic production is sold in other countries .	0	economic
 4340 . In many cases , it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price .	0	economic
 If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $ 300 , then $ 300 measures the amount of “ other consumption ” that he has given up .	0	economic
 Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility , which means that as a person receives more of a good , the additional ( or marginal ) utility from each additional unit of the good declines .	0	economic
 In other words , the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth . The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all - or - nothing choices .	0	economic
 4346 . The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up .	0	economic
 Just as with Alphonso ’s budget constraint , the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier .	0	economic
 By now you might be saying , “ Hey , this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint . ” If so , read the following Clear It Up feature .	0	economic
 4349 . In everyday usage , efficiency refers to lack of waste .	0	economic
 4352 . For government , this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm .	0	economic
 At the individual and firm level , the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity , quality , and price that people want .	0	economic
 But for both the government and the market economy in the short term , increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy .	0	economic
 4355 . Fortunately however , the assumption that individuals are purely self - interested is a simplification about human nature .	0	economic
 In fact , we need to look no further than to Adam Smith , the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this .	0	economic
 The opening sentence of his book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , puts it very clearly : “ How selfish soever man may be supposed , there are evidently some principles in his nature , which interest him in the fortune of others , and render their happiness necessary to him , though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it . ” Clearly , individuals are both self - interested and altruistic .	0	economic
 All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases , there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other .	0	economic
 4361 . To find answers to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity .	0	economic
 Suppose you drop two items from a second - floor balcony .	0	economic
 4367 . Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .	0	economic
 In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity .	0	economic
 This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods .	0	economic
 However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .	0	economic
 4379 . Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital MarketsThe concept of elasticity applies to any market , not just markets for goods and services .	0	economic
 In the labor market , for example , the wage elasticity of labor supply — that is , the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages — will determine the shape of the labor supply curve .	0	economic
 Specifically :	0	economic
 4382 . If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .	0	economic
 This activity of production goes beyond manufacturing ( i.e. , making things ) .	0	economic
 It includes any process or service that creates value , including transportation , distribution , wholesale and retail sales .	0	economic
 4385 . Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .	0	economic
 Implicit costs are more subtle , but just as important .	0	economic
 4388 . The cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses .	0	economic
 A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast - food meals .	0	economic
 Labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours .	0	economic
 4394 . But as output expands still further , the average cost begins to rise .	0	economic
 At the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in . Average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output .	0	economic
 For example , the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $ 400 , so the average variable cost is $ 400/80 , or $ 5 per haircut .	0	economic
 4397 . Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market .	0	economic
 Expanding the equation for profit gives :	0	economic
 4400 . While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve .	0	economic
 Thus , the long - run average cost ( LRAC ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( SRAC ) curves , each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs .	0	economic
 4403 . Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm , not just a large factory .	0	economic
 The leviathan effect can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently , across the entirety of the enterprise .	0	economic
 Firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region , thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level .

 A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service .	0	economic
 4409 . The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period ( for example , per day or per year ) and over some geographic area ( like a state or a country ) .	0	economic
 ( Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable ( x ) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable ( y ) goes on the vertical .	0	economic
 A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .	0	economic
 4415 . Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .	0	economic
 The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information .	0	economic
 At any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price .	0	economic
 4421 . The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied .	0	economic
 The result was the demand curve and the supply curve .	0	economic
 4424 . For some — luxury cars , vacations in Europe , and fine jewelry — the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced .	0	economic
 A few exceptions to this pattern do exist .	0	economic
 4427 . The demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements .	0	economic
 As electronic books , like this one , become more available , you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books .	0	economic
 4430 . If other factors relevant to supply do change , then the entire supply curve will shift .	0	economic
 Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price , a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price .	0	economic
 4433 . According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press , more and more people , especially younger people , are getting their news from online and digital sources .	0	economic

 Price controls come in two flavors .	0	economic
 4439 . Markets for labor have demand and supply curves , just like markets for goods .	0	economic
 The law of demand applies in labor markets this way : A higher salary or wage — that is , a higher price in the labor market — leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers , while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded .	0	economic
 The law of supply functions in labor markets , too : A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied ; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied . Equilibrium in the Labor Market	0	economic
 A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor .	0	economic

 Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses . In this section , we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital ( i.e. , savings ) with those who demand financial capital ( i.e. , borrowing ) .	0	economic
 Those who save money ( or make financial investments , which is the same thing ) , whether individuals or businesses , are on the supply side of the financial market .	0	economic
 Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time .	0	economic
 Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store , decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time , sometimes a long period .	0	economic
 4451 . A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets .	0	economic
 The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive .	0	economic

 If a business is making losses in the short run , it will either keep limping along or just shut down , depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs .	0	economic
 4487 . Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit . To understand how short - run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run , imagine the following situation .	0	economic
 The market is in long - run equilibrium , where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC .	0	economic
 No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market .	0	economic
 In this case , the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs .	0	economic
 4493 . In this chapter , we explore the opposite extreme : monopoly . If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price , monopoly is a market with no competition at all , and firms have complete market power .	0	economic
 Since a monopoly faces no significant competition , it can charge any price it wishes .	0	economic
 Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S. government .	0	economic
 Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property , although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries .	0	economic
 4505 . Profits for the monopolist , like any firm , will be equal to total revenues minus total costs .	0	economic
 The pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm — that is , by using total cost , fixed cost , variable cost , marginal cost , average cost , and average variable cost .	0	economic
 However , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm .	0	economic
 It is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost .	0	economic
 4511 . What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes , firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive ?	0	economic
 What determines their behavior ?	0	economic
 Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing ; restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food ; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names .	0	economic
 [ link ] offers a reminder that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat , because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price .	0	economic
 In contrast , the demand curve , as faced by a monopolist , is the market demand curve , since a monopolist is the only firm in the market , and hence is downward sloping .	0	economic
 4520 . As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .	0	economic
 The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .	0	economic
 4523 . The long - term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve .	0	economic
 This outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost .	0	economic
 However , in monopolistic competition , the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve , not at the very bottom of the AC curve .	0	economic
 4526 . Similarly , a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .	0	economic
 In such a setting , the market has room for only one firm , because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete , and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market .	0	economic

 Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .	0	economic
 If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .	0	economic
 4577 . Other laws required the installation of certain equipment — for example , on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks — to reduce pollution .	0	economic
 These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation .	0	economic
 A pollution charge gives a profit - maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax .	0	economic

 3338 . Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically .	0	psychology
 Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .	0	psychology
 3341 . Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 A neuron ’s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane .	0	psychology
 3344 . The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .	0	psychology
 These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .	0	psychology
 3347 . In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .	0	psychology
 3350 . The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .	0	psychology

 These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .	0	psychology
 The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side . Normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day - to - day functions , but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well .	0	psychology
 3377 . The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .	0	psychology
 Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .	0	psychology
 3386 . Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .	0	psychology
 3389 . The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures , but three of the most important are the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the hypothalamus ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3392 . In 1953 , Henry Gustav Molaison ( H. M. ) was a 27-year - old man who experienced severe seizures .	0	psychology
 In an attempt to control his seizures , H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala .	0	psychology
 3395 . The substantia nigra ( Latin for “ black substance ” ) and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are also located in the midbrain ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine , and both are critical for movement .	0	psychology
 It also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep .	0	psychology
 3401 . Brain ImagingYou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain .	0	psychology
 Increasingly , however , we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury .	0	psychology
 In this section , we take a more in - depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain , including techniques that rely on radiation , magnetic fields , or electrical activity within the brain .	0	psychology
 The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’s cells to move .	0	psychology
 3413 . Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive , strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm .	0	psychology
 Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board ( IRB ) .	0	psychology
 3416 . For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .	0	psychology
 In cases where deception is involved , participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study — complete , honest information about the purpose of the experiment , how the data collected will be used , the reasons why deception was necessary , and information about how to obtain additional information about the study .	0	psychology
 3419 . Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants , animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) .	0	psychology
 3422 . The sign — positive or negative — of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .	0	psychology
 3425 . However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .	0	psychology
 While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .	0	psychology
 In the ice cream / crime rate example mentioned earlier , temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables .	0	psychology
 3428 . Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid .	0	psychology
 Other times , we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind , even if that information is severely limited .	0	psychology
 3431 . The two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference— experimental manipulation .	0	psychology
 Since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups , we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance .	0	psychology
 3434 . By being blind to which child is in which group , we protect against those biases .	0	psychology
 This situation is a single - blind study , meaning that one of the groups ( participants ) are unaware as to which group they are in ( experiment or control group ) while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group .	0	psychology
 3437 . To achieve this , we must pay attention to two important variables , or things that can be changed , in any experimental study : the independent variable and the dependent variable .	0	psychology
 In a well - designed experimental study , the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups .	0	psychology
 3440 . If possible , we should use a random sample ( there are other types of samples , but for the purposes of this chapter , we will focus on random samples ) .	0	psychology
 Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population .	0	psychology
 3443 . Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups , a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups .	0	psychology
 A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance ( and thus not meaningful ) .	0	psychology
 3446 . Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection .	0	psychology
 In the context of psychological research , this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent , reproducible ways .	0	psychology
 3449 . If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior , focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole .	0	psychology
 Again , case studies provide enormous amounts of information , but since the cases are so specific , the potential to apply what ’s learned to the average person may be very limited .	0	psychology
 3452 . The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity , or accuracy , of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting .	0	psychology
 3455 . Often , psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data .	0	psychology
 Generally , the survey itself can be completed in a short time , and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people .	0	psychology
 For example , we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20 , retest them a decade later at age 30 , and then again at age 40 .	0	psychology
 3461 . In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others , such as intuition and personal experience , the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim .	0	psychology
 If someone is crying , we can see behavior .	0	psychology
 In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .	0	psychology
 The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world .	0	psychology
 The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 3473 . In most areas of psychology , this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology .	0	psychology
 Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .	0	psychology
 3476 . Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree , which is known as a PsyD .	0	psychology
 A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology .	0	psychology
 PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research - oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context ( Norcorss & Castle , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 3479 . Evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades .	0	psychology
 To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause .	0	psychology
 Developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation .	0	psychology
 3485 . More recently , the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach .	0	psychology
 Rather than explaining how personality arises , research is focused on identifying personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation .	0	psychology
 3488 . Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted .	0	psychology
 Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience .	0	psychology
 After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial .	0	psychology
 Health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy , education , intervention , and research .	0	psychology
 3494 . As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .	0	psychology
 3497 . Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832–1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist .	0	psychology
 His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 .	0	psychology
 3500 . William James ( 1842–1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 James was introduced to Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’s characteristics .	0	psychology
 3503 . According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue .	0	psychology
 3506 . John B. Watson ( 1878–1958 ) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed .	0	psychology
 When the animal pushes the button or lever , the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a noise ) or a token conditioner ( such as a light ) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment .	0	psychology
 3512 . Carl Rogers ( 1902–1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client - centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy .	0	psychology
 3515 . We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep .	0	psychology
 3518 . This pattern of temperature fluctuation , which repeats every day , is one example of a circadian rhythm .	0	psychology
 Our sleep - wake cycle , which is linked to our environment ’s natural light - dark cycle , is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm , but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate , blood pressure , blood sugar , and body temperature .	0	psychology
 3521 . The brain ’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) .	0	psychology
 The axons of light - sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present , allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world ( Klein , Moore , & Reppert , 1991 ; Welsh , Takahashi , & Kay , 2010 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3527 . Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles .	0	psychology
 For example , a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday , 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday , and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday .	0	psychology
 3530 . Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation .	0	psychology
 3533 . Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .	0	psychology
 In contrast , non - REM ( NREM ) sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves .	0	psychology
 The first four stages of sleep are NREM sleep , while the fifth and final stage of sleep is REM sleep .	0	psychology
 3536 . As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep , there is an increase in theta wave activity .	0	psychology
 It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep ; in fact , people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep .	0	psychology
 3539 . In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .	0	psychology
 Thus , K - complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments ( Halász , 1993 ; Steriade & Amzica , 1998 ) .	0	psychology
 3542 . Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams .	0	psychology
 3545 . Among a variety of neurobiological evidence , John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general .	0	psychology
 In a lucid dream , a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming , and as such , they can control the dream ’s content ( LaBerge , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 During periods of sleepwalking , sleepers often have their eyes open , but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them .	0	psychology
 Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake , they generally have no memories of the events that occurred , and attempts to console them are ineffective .	0	psychology
 3557 . Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .	0	psychology
 3560 . A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences .	0	psychology
 These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug .	0	psychology
 3566 . In recent years , methamphetamine ( meth ) use has become increasingly widespread .	0	psychology
 Despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult , methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option ( Shukla , Crump , & Chrisco , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 3569 . Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco ; therefore , there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques .	0	psychology
 To date , people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products .	0	psychology
 In general , smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term , but it is unclear whether these effects persist ( Cropley , Theadom , Pravettoni , & Webb , 2008 ; Levitt , Shaw , Wong , & Kaczorowski , 2007 ; Smedslund , Fisher , Boles , & Lichtenstein , 2004 ) .	0	psychology
 3572 . Still , people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult .	0	psychology
 Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .	0	psychology
 In some cases , users experience vivid visual hallucinations .	0	psychology
 When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor , sensation has occurred .	0	psychology
 For example , light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye .	0	psychology
 3581 . It has been estimated that on a clear night , the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away ( Okawa & Sampath , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain : This is an absolute threshold .	0	psychology
 3584 . Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .	0	psychology
 On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .	0	psychology
 3587 . Because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball , they completely tuned out other visual information .	0	psychology
 3590 . For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .	0	psychology
 One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .	0	psychology
 3593 . Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form .	0	psychology
 Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies , and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3596 . Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds .	0	psychology
 A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB ; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3599 . Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .	0	psychology
 It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .	0	psychology
 The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .	0	psychology
 3605 . These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .	0	psychology
 Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide tremendous spatial resolution .	0	psychology
 3608 . The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .	0	psychology
 We are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons : First , each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field ; therefore , the blind spots do not overlap .	0	psychology
 5224 . Now , let ’s look at what happens with protectionism .	0	economic
 U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that , if only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil , the United States would have higher domestic sugar production , more jobs in the sugar industry , and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price .	0	economic
 5227 . While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , from spring 2008 to late 2009 , the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % to 10 % ; it has since fallen back to 5.5 % in spring 2015—the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time .	0	economic
 The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for two reasons , it costs jobs in other unprotected industries .	0	economic
 First , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries .	0	economic
 5230 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .	0	economic
 After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .	0	economic
 Meanwhile , low - skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing .	0	economic
 5236 . If free trade meant the destruction of life itself , then even economists would convert to protectionism !	0	economic
 While globalization — and economic activity of all kinds — can pose environmental dangers , it seems quite possible that , with the appropriate safeguards in place , the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized .	0	economic
 5239 . The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this .	0	economic
 Profit - seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards , thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits .	0	economic
 5242 . The United Nations was unable to agree to this .	0	economic
 In 1995 , the GATT was transformed into the WTO .	0	economic
 5245 . For the United States , perhaps the best - known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .	0	economic
 5248 . What is a function ?	0	economic
 Sometimes the relationship is a definition .	0	economic
 Graphically , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises .	0	economic
 A circle represents a group as a whole .	0	economic
 By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic — the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model . What Is an Indifference Curve ?	0	economic
 5263 . From this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high — so on the margin , it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book .	0	economic
 5266 . Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations : a substitution effect and an income effect .	0	economic
 If oranges become more expensive , fruit - lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples , grapefruit , or raisins .	0	economic
 5269 . The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen , so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility .	0	economic
 The slope of the budget constraint in a labor - leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate .	0	economic
 Thus , the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set , reflecting the labor - leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate , but tangent to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ” The shift from original choice A to point C , which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line , shows that because of the higher wage , Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income .	0	economic
 The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending .	0	economic
 Thus , the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the 45-degree line .	0	economic
 It must always hold true that :	0	economic
 5281 . Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward - sloping line , with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import ( MPI ) , out of national income .	0	economic
 In [ link ] ( b ) , the marginal propensity to import is 0.1 .	0	economic
 The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and export expenditures — which do not vary with national income .	0	economic
 5287 . Conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( AE0 ) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP .	0	economic
 The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting .	0	economic
 5290 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .	0	economic
 5293 . Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $ 45 , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ 80 , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product .	0	economic
 2419 . His work strongly influenced the subsequent avant - garde and modernist movements in literature and art , especially in understanding the role of the observer , artist , or writer in shaping the society they attempted to observe .	0	history
 Dewey believed that education , specifically observation and change through the scientific method , was the best tool by which to reform and improve American society as it continued to grow ever more complex .	0	history
 2422 . Instead , the Republican Party nominated a three - time governor from Ohio , Rutherford B. Hayes .	0	history
 In this most notorious example of Gilded Age corruption , several congressmen accepted cash and stock bribes in return for appropriating inflated federal funds for the construction of the transcontinental railroad .	0	history

 The other was James G. Blaine , Republican senator from Maine and leader of the Half - Breeds .	0	history
 2428 . One of the first efforts to organize farmers came in 1867 with Oliver Hudson Kelly ’s creation of the Patrons of Husbandry , more popularly known as the Grange .	0	history

 2431 . In 1891 , the alliance formed the Populist Party , or People ’s Party , as it was more widely known .	0	history
 Beginning with nonpresidential - year elections , the Populist Party had modest success , particularly in Kansas , Nebraska , and the Dakotas , where they succeeded in electing several state legislators , one governor , and a handful of congressmen .	0	history
 2434 . A group of journalists and writers collectively known as muckrakers provided an important spark that ignited the Progressive movement .	0	history

 Grassroots Progressives pushed forward their agenda of direct democracy through the passage of three state - level reforms .	0	history
 2440 . At the state level , perhaps the greatest advocate of Progressive government was Robert La Follette ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 “ Fighting Bob ” supported numerous Progressive ideas while governor : He signed into law the first workman ’s compensation system , approved a minimum wage law , developed a progressive tax law , adopted the direct election of U.S. senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory , and advocated for women ’s suffrage .	0	history
 2443 . Although Debs established a tenuous relationship with Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor , some within the Socialist Party favored a more radical political stance than Debs ’s craft union structure .	0	history
 As a result , William “ Big Bill ” Haywood formed the more radical IWW , or Wobblies , in 1905 .	0	history
 Although he remained an active member of the Socialist Party until 1919 , Haywood appreciated the outcry of the more radical arm of the party that desired an industrial union approach to labor organization .	0	history
 2446 . In a speech delivered at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895 , which was meant to promote the economy of a “ New South , ” Washington proposed what came to be known as the Atlanta Compromise ( [ link ] ) .	0	history

 4244 . The “ borderline ” in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort to describe patients who appeared anxious , but were prone to brief psychotic experiences — that is , patients who were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis ( Freeman , Stone , Martin , & Reinecke , 2005 ) .	0	psychology
 Today , borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning .	0	psychology
 Borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships , self - image , and mood , as well as marked impulsivity ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 4247 . The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders .	0	psychology
 Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in which depression is the main feature .	1	psychology

 4253 . Another subtype , peripartum onset ( commonly referred to as postpartum depression ) , applies to women who experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks .	0	psychology
 4256 . To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in his life ; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder , they are not required for a diagnosis ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 According to the DSM-5 , a manic episode is characterized as a “ distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated , expansive , or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week , ” that lasts most of the time each day ( APA , 2013 , p. 124 ) .	1	psychology
 During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .	0	psychology
 4262 . Overwhelmed by hopelessness , devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness , and burdened with the inability to adequately cope with such feelings , they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out .	0	psychology
 Suicide , defined by the CDC as “ death caused by self - directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of the behavior ” ( CDC , 2013a ) , in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same time Crosby , Ortega , & Melanson , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 Not only must the person be biologically or psychologically vulnerable , but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act , and he must lack the necessary protective factors ( e.g. , social support from friends and family , religion , coping skills , and problem - solving skills ) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain ( Berman , 2009 ) .	0	psychology

 Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .	1	psychology
 4292 . Violating cultural expectations is not , in and of itself , a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Since behavior varies from one culture to another , what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures .	0	psychology
 For example , returning a stranger ’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures .	0	psychology
 4295 . How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person ’s inner states and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder ?	0	psychology
 Arriving at a proper diagnosis — that is , appropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms — is absolutely crucial .	1	psychology
 This process enables professionals to use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the patient , colleagues and the public .	0	psychology
 4298 . A second classification system , the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , is also widely recognized .	0	psychology
 Published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War II and , like the DSM , has been revised several times .	0	psychology
 4301 . In this dimension , people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers , cold , nonconformists , impulsive , antisocial , and hostile , whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control — they are more altruistic , empathetic , cooperative , and conventional ( Eysenck , Eysenck & Barrett , 1985).While Cattell ’s 16 factors may be too broad , the Eysenck ’s two - factor system has been criticized for being too narrow .	0	psychology
 Another personality theory , called the Five Factor Model , effectively hits a middle ground , with its five factors referred to as the Big Five personality traits .	0	psychology
 It is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic trait dimensions ( Funder , 2001 ) .	0	psychology
 4304 . One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration ( Rentfrow et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology

 4222 . Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .	1	psychology
 Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .	1	psychology
 A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream , or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal .	0	psychology
 4228 . These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .	1	psychology
 People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .	1	psychology
 For example , the person who claims to be Jesus Christ , or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years , or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions .	0	psychology
 4231 . Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .	1	psychology
 In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .	1	psychology
 4234 . Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings : drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms ( Howes & Kapur , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
 The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia ( Snyder , 1976 ) .	1	psychology
 More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways .	0	psychology
 4237 . Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions .	0	psychology
 A new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis , such as unusual thought content , paranoia , odd communication , delusions , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are coined prodromal symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder .	0	psychology
 A number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of psychosis ) , recent deterioration in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of suspicion or paranoia , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( Fusar - Poli et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 4240 . The term personality refers loosely to one ’s stable , consistent , and distinctive way of thinking about , feeling , acting , and relating to the world .	1	psychology
 People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture , is pervasive and inflexible , begins in adolescence or early adulthood , and causes distress or impairment ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact .	0	psychology
 4243 . People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .	0	psychology
 Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and obsessive - compulsive personality disorder ( which is not the same thing as obsessive - compulsive disorder ) .	1	psychology
 People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful .	0	psychology
 4246 . Mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also mania and elation ( Rothschild , 1999 ) .	1	psychology
 All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states , and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives .	0	psychology
 4252 . These subtypes — what the DSM-5 refer to as specifiers — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present .	0	psychology
 One subtype , seasonal pattern , applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or winter ) .	1	psychology
 In everyday language , people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues .	0	psychology
 4255 . A person with bipolar disorder ( commonly known as manic depression ) often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to unipolar , which indicates a persistently sad mood ) .	1	psychology
 4258 . If so , what might such predispositions be ?	0	psychology
 A study by Caspi and others ( 2003 ) suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin ( the 5-HTTLPR gene ) might be one culprit .	0	psychology
 These investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions .	0	psychology
 4261 . This theory , which focuses on rumination in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1987 ) .	0	psychology
 Rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms , rather that distracting one ’s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1991 ) .	1	psychology
 When people ruminate , they have thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotivated ?	0	psychology
 4264 . Obsessive - compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive , unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors .	0	psychology
 Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , craving double cheeseburgers when dieting ) , and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion ( e.g. , pacing when nervous ) .	0	psychology
 4267 . Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing , cleaning , checking ( e.g. , that a door is locked ) , and ordering ( e.g. , lining up all the pencils in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as counting , praying , or reciting something to oneself ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Compulsions characteristic of OCD are not performed out of pleasure , nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event .	0	psychology
 4270 . A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex ( Kopell & Greenberg , 2008 ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( Rushworth , Noonan , Boorman , Walton , & Behrens , 2011 ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 In people with OCD , the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which , for example , they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall ( Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischkel , & Kathmann , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 4273 . SPECIFIC PHOBIAPhobia is a Greek word that means fear .	0	psychology
 A person diagnosed with a specific phobia ( formerly known as simple phobia ) experiences excessive , distressing , and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , enclosed spaces , elevators , or flying ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 Even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational , some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) .	0	psychology
 4276 . The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning , such as modeling .	0	psychology
 For example , a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears , even though spiders have never presented any danger to him .	0	psychology
 4279 . People with panic disorder experience recurrent ( more than one ) and unexpected panic attacks , along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks , worry over the consequences of the attacks , or self - defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations ) ( APA , 2013 ) .	1	psychology
 As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .	0	psychology
 4282 . Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened ( Bouton , Mineka , & Barlow , 2001 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , consider a child who has asthma .	0	psychology
 4285 . For centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective : attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding .	1	psychology
 Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits ( [ link ] ) ( Maher & Maher , 1985 ) .	0	psychology
 4288 . The diathesis - stress model ( Zuckerman , 1999 ) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder .	0	psychology
 This diathesis - stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder ( i.e. , a diathesis ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood maltreatment , negative life events , trauma , and so on .	1	psychology
 4291 . Such feelings would be normal .	0	psychology
 If you felt extremely depressed — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or sleeping , felt utterly worthless , and contemplated suicide — your feelings would be atypical , would deviate from the norm , and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder .	0	psychology
 Just because something is atypical , however , does not necessarily mean it is disordered .	0	psychology
 4294 . Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .	0	psychology
 According to the APA ( 2013 ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following :	0	psychology
 4297 . The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity ; the co - occurrence of two disorders .	1	psychology
 For example , the DSM-5 mentions that 41 % of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 4300 . Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on temperament , the inborn , genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter .	0	psychology
 They believed personality is largely governed by biology .	0	psychology
 4303 . The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .	1	psychology
 Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .	0	psychology
 4306 . Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing .	0	psychology
 This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud — projection — as a way to assess unconscious processes .	1	psychology
 1823 . They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect .	0	biology
 Malpighian tubules are convoluted , which increases their surface area , and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance .	1	biology
 Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum .	0	biology
 1826 . Mammals , including humans , produce urea , whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid .	0	biology
 Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals .	1	biology
 1841 . Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis .	0	biology
 A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens .	1	biology
 Neutrophils , shown in [ link ] , are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system .	0	biology
 1847 . T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .	0	biology
 T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .	1	biology
 NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .	1	biology
 1853 . Complement proteins perform several functions .	0	biology
 The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells , such as macrophages and B cells , and enhance engulfment ; this process is called opsonization .	1	biology
 Certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes .	0	biology
 1856 . An antigen is a foreign or “ non - self ” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system .	1	biology
 Not all antigens will provoke a response .	0	biology
 1859 . Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen .	0	biology
 T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens , called epitopes , presented by APCs , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen ; for this reason , epitopes are known as “ antigenic determinants . ” In the absence of information from APCs , T and B cells remain inactive , or naïve , and are unable to prepare an immune response .	0	biology
 1862 . When stimulated by the TH2 pathway , naïve B cells differentiate into antibody - secreting plasma cells .	0	biology
 A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies ; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens .	1	biology
 Similar to T cells , naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors ( BCRs ) , which are membrane - bound forms of Ig ( immunoglobulin , or an antibody ) .	1	biology
 1865 . Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue , which functions independently of the systemic immune system , and which has its own innate and adaptive components .	1	biology
 Mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , illustrated in [ link ] , is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body .	1	biology
 This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment .	0	biology
 1868 . The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .	1	biology
 In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens , other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response , which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self - antigens .	0	biology
 Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis .	0	biology
 1874 . The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined , multivalent structures ( such as IgM and IgA ) .	1	biology
 Although avidity measures the strength of binding , just as affinity does , the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure .	0	biology
 1877 . The renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , illustrated in [ link ] proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin II , which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume .	1	biology
 Renin ( secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex ) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles .	1	biology
 1880 . It also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex , which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium .	0	biology
 Angiotensin II also triggers the release of anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) from the hypothalamus , leading to water retention in the kidneys .	0	biology
 It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate .	0	biology
 1883 . Failures , insufficiencies , or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed .	0	biology
 Immunodeficiency is the failure , insufficiency , or delay in the response of the immune system , which may be acquired or inherited .	1	biology
 Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens ( such as HIV ) , chemical exposure ( including certain medical treatments ) , malnutrition , or possibly by extreme stress .	0	biology
 1886 . Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population .	1	biology
 Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .	0	biology
 1892 . Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration .	1	biology
 If the animal is capable of fragmentation , and the part is big enough , a separate individual will regrow .	0	biology
 1898 . In viviparity the young develop within the female , receiving nourishment from the mother ’s blood through a placenta .	1	biology
 The offspring develops in the female and is born alive .	0	biology
 1904 . Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions ( about 10 percent of the total ) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen ’s volume .	1	biology
 Sperm are haploid cells , consisting of a flagellum as a tail , a neck that contains the cell ’s energy - producing mitochondria , and a head that contains the genetic material .	0	biology
 1907 . The walnut - shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra , the connection to the urinary bladder .	1	biology
 It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra .	0	biology
 1910 . The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .	1	biology
 The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .	1	biology
 The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .	0	biology
 1916 . In both sexes , the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland .	1	biology
 When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .	0	biology
 1922 . In addition , estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles .	0	biology
 Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth , ovulation , and calcium absorption ; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females .	1	biology
 These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .	0	biology
 1925 . Just prior to the middle of the cycle ( approximately day 14 ) , the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly , then fall .	0	biology
 The spike in LH causes ovulation : the most mature follicle , like that shown in [ link ] , ruptures and releases its egg .	1	biology
 The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost .	0	biology
 1928 . In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .	1	biology
 When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .	0	biology
 In placental mammals , the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane , as illustrated in [ link]b .	1	biology
 1931 . In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .	0	biology
 Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .	0	biology
 1934 . Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual .	1	biology
 The length of time of gestation varies among animals , but is very similar among the great apes : human gestation is 266 days , while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days , a gorilla ’s is 257 days , and orangutan gestation is 260 days long .	0	biology
 The fox has a 57-day gestation .	0	biology
 1937 . The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control .	1	biology
 Strictly speaking , contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining .	0	biology
 Both terms are , however , frequently used interchangeably .	0	biology
 1940 . The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 In further development , the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord .	0	biology
 1943 . A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time .	1	biology
 ( Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics . )	1	biology
 A population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries : natural boundaries might be rivers , mountains , or deserts , while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass , manmade structures , or roads .	0	biology
 1946 . Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere .	0	biology
 The abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes : large areas of land with similar climate , flora , and fauna .	0	biology
 1955 . There is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low aboveground biomass .	0	biology
 The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost .	1	biology
 The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter , which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter .	0	biology
 1958 . The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .	1	biology
 Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .	1	biology
 At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .	1	biology
 1961 . The neritic zone ( [ link ] ) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m ( or 650 ft ) at the edge of the continental shelf .	1	biology
 Since light can penetrate this depth , photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone .	0	biology
 1964 . The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone , which is at depths of 4000 m or greater .	1	biology
 The abyssal zone ( [ link ] ) is very cold and has very high pressure , high oxygen content , and low nutrient content .	0	biology
 1970 . Because of this , they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds .	0	biology
 When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus ( from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms , for example ) , the growth of algae skyrockets , resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom .	1	biology
 Algal blooms ( [ link ] ) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water .	0	biology
 1973 . Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth .	1	biology
 Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves , stems , and flowers extending above the water ’s surface .	1	biology
 There are several types of wetlands including marshes , swamps , bogs , mudflats , and salt marshes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1976 . Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder - than - average temperatures that occurred on one day .	0	biology
 In contrast , weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time .	1	biology
 Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles .	0	biology
 1979 . This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide .	0	biology
 This led to haze - effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze - effect cooling usually extends for one or more years .	1	biology
 In Europe and North America , haze - effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784 .	0	biology
 1982 . Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates .	0	biology
 Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean .	1	biology
 When water warms , these chunks of ice melt and methane is released .	0	biology
 1985 . The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist , and how closely associated they are with each other .	0	biology
 Within a particular habitat , a population can be characterized by its population size ( N ) , the total number of individuals , and its population density , the number of individuals within a specific area or volume .	0	biology
 Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations .	0	biology
 1988 . In addition to measuring simple density , further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals .	0	biology
 Species dispersion patterns ( or distribution patterns ) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time .	1	biology
 In other words , they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart , and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart .	0	biology
 1994 . Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .	0	biology
 Therefore , when calculating the growth rate of a population , the death rate ( D ) ( number organisms that die during a particular time interval ) is subtracted from the birth rate ( B ) ( number organisms that are born during that interval ) .	1	biology
 This is shown in the following formula :	0	biology
 1997 . The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits ( which we know now are transferred by genes ) to the next generation at a greater rate ( natural selection ) .	1	biology
 To model the reality of limited resources , population ecologists developed the logistic growth model .	0	biology
 2000 . In the real world , phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others .	0	biology
 The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition ( intra- = “ within ” ; -specific = “ species ” ) .	1	biology
 Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity — resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need .	0	biology
 2006 . In Müllerian mimicry , multiple species share the same warning coloration , but all of them actually have defenses .	1	biology
 [ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .	0	biology
 2009 . SymbiosisSymbiotic relationships , or symbioses ( plural ) , are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations .	1	biology
 Most scientists accept this definition , but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic , where both individuals benefit from the interaction .	0	biology
 2012 . A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .	1	biology
 In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .	0	biology
 2015 . The area in question could be a habitat , a biome , or the entire biosphere .	0	biology
 Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome .	1	biology
 Species richness varies across the globe ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2018 . Keystone SpeciesA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community ’s structure .	1	biology
 The intertidal sea star , Pisaster ochraceus , of the northwestern United States is a keystone species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2021 . On the Big Island , approximately 32 acres of land is added each year .	0	biology
 First , weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements , known as pioneer species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other , less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species .	0	biology
 2024 . Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .	1	biology
 Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .	1	biology
 The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .	0	biology
 2027 . Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli .	0	biology
 The simplest example of this is a reflex action , an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus .	1	biology
 To test the “ knee - jerk ” reflex , a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer .	0	biology
 2030 . A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed , the pattern goes on to completion .	1	biology
 An example of such a behavior occurs in the three - spined stickleback , a small freshwater fish ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 2033 . Communication within a SpeciesAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals .	1	biology
 An example of this is seen in the three - spined stickleback , where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate .	0	biology
 2036 . Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish .	0	biology
 They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young .	1	biology
 2039 . In monogamous systems , one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season .	1	biology
 In some animals , such as the gray wolf , these associations can last much longer , even a lifetime .	0	biology
 2042 . Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure .	1	biology
 This is a form of non - associative learning , as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward .	0	biology
 2045 . In classical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with , the conditioned stimulus .	1	biology
 The response to the original , unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response .	1	biology
 2048 . A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime , such as how resources are allocated for growth , maintenance , and reproduction .	1	biology
 Life history traits affect the life table of an organism .	0	biology
 2051 . Single versus Multiple Reproductive EventsSome life history traits , such as fecundity , timing of reproduction , and parental care , can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species .	0	biology
 Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies .	1	biology
 Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event , sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive .	0	biology
 2054 . Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways .	0	biology
 These are grouped into density - dependent factors , in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality , and density - independent factors , which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density .	1	biology
 Note that in the former , the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset .	0	biology
 2057 . Furthermore , the theory ignored the age - specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important .	0	biology
 New demographic - based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and K - selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors .	0	biology
 2060 . In ecology , two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and resilience .	0	biology
 The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .	1	biology
 The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .	1	biology
 2063 . There is a single path through the chain .	0	biology
 Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level .	1	biology
 Depending on their role as producers or consumers , species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels .	0	biology
 2066 . The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .	1	biology
 Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .	1	biology
 2069 . A holistic model — which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment — is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems .	1	biology
 A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic , non - linear web of primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 2072 . The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment ( disturbances ) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics .	1	biology
 Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies .	0	biology
 2075 . Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management : a conceptual model , an analytical model , and a simulation model .	0	biology
 A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem .	1	biology
 A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem ; however , its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited .	0	biology
 2078 . Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available , such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy .	0	biology
 2081 . In this ecosystem , the total energy accumulated by the primary producers ( gross primary productivity ) was shown to be 20,810 kcal / m2/yr . Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions ( like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss ) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem .	0	biology
 Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss .	1	biology
 The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level .	0	biology
 2084 . Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level .	1	biology
 Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .	1	biology
 Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food .	1	biology
 2087 . Geologic processes , such as weathering , erosion , water drainage , and the subduction of the continental plates , all play a role in this recycling of materials .	0	biology
 Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process , the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle .	1	biology
 2090 . Fossil fuels are considered a non - renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation .	0	biology
 A non - renewable resource , such as fossil fuel , is either regenerated very slowly or not at all .	1	biology
 Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .	0	biology
 2093 . A dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna ; these zones can be caused by eutrophication , oil spills , dumping of toxic chemicals , and other human activities .	1	biology
 The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years , and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008 .	0	biology
 2096 . Traditionally , ecologists have measured biodiversity , a general term for the variety present in the biosphere , by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness .	1	biology
 Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things .	0	biology
 2099 . Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts .	0	biology
 Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species .	1	biology
 2102 . All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria ; therefore , the 500 species of cichlids were endemic .	0	biology
 Endemic species are found in only one location .	1	biology
 Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction .	0	biology
 2105 . The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions , and a recent one .	0	biology
 It is well known that the North American , and to some degree Eurasian , megafauna , or large animals , disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period .	0	biology
 The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000–12,000 years ago .	0	biology
 2108 . Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area .	0	biology
 Most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as medication .	1	biology
 For centuries in Europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals — books that identified plants and their uses .	0	biology
 2111 . Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve .	1	biology
 Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena .	0	biology
 5299 . In March 2014 , a group of musicians got together in a fish market in Odessa for a spontaneous performance of Beethoven 's “ Ode to Joy ” from his Ninth Symphony .	0	sociology
 While tensions were building over Ukraine 's efforts to join the European Union , and even as Russian troops had taken control of the Ukrainian airbase in Belbek , the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song . Spontaneous gatherings like this are called flash mobs .	0	sociology
 They often are captured on video and shared on the Internet ; frequently they go viral .	0	sociology
 5302 . Turner and Killian ( 1993 ) identified four types of crowds .	0	sociology
 Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .	1	sociology
 Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .	1	sociology
 5308 . They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior , especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors .	0	sociology
 Emergent norm theory asserts that , in this circumstance , people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular ( individual ) set of norms , which may change as the crowd experience evolves .	1	sociology
 This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective . For Turner and Killian , the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation , or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar .	0	sociology
 5311 . Social movements are purposeful , organized groups that strive to work toward a common social goal .	1	sociology
 While most of us learned about social movements in history classes , we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused —and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements .	0	sociology
 5314 . Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .	0	sociology
 Revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society .	1	sociology
 These include the 1960s counterculture movement , including the revolutionary group The Weather Underground , as well as anarchist collectives .	0	sociology
 5320 . Churches and their ministers joined the struggle , and the protest organization In Friendship was formed as well as The Friendly Club and the Club From Nowhere .	0	sociology
 A social movement industry , which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals , was growing . Martin Luther King Jr. emerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement , gained respect from elites in the federal government , and aided by even more emerging SMOs such as the Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , among others .	1	sociology
 Several still exist today .	0	sociology
 5323 . As you can see , there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames .	0	sociology
 Finally , motivational framing is the call to action : what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame ?	1	sociology
 These frames are action - oriented .	0	sociology
 5326 . Collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change , which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations .	0	sociology
 Essentially , any disruptive shift in the status quo , be it intentional or random , human - caused or natural , can lead to social change .	0	sociology
 5329 . Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .	1	sociology
 A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .	1	sociology
 5332 . The term culture refers to the group ’s shared practices , values , and beliefs .	1	sociology
 Culture encompasses a group ’s way of life , from routine , everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members ' lives .	0	sociology
 5335 . Some sociologists study social facts , which are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life , that may contribute to these changes in the family .	1	sociology
 Do people in the United States view marriage and family differently than before ?	0	sociology
 5338 . He argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to a very large extent on interactions with others .	0	sociology
 Mead called specific individuals that impacted a person ’s life significant others , and he also conceptualized “ generalized others ” as the organized and generalized attitude of a social group .	1	sociology
 Mead ’s work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro - level of analysis .	0	sociology
 5341 . The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology .	0	sociology
 Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants .	1	sociology
 Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .	0	sociology
 5344 . For example , although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon , Émile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it .	0	sociology
 His studied social ties within a group , or social solidarity , and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion - based differences .	1	sociology
 Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans who had ended their lives , and he did indeed find differences based on religion .	0	sociology
 5347 . Functionalism , also called structural - functional theory , sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society .	1	sociology
 Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .	0	sociology
 5350 . Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .	0	sociology
 In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .	1	sociology
 5353 . Latent functions can be beneficial , neutral , or harmful .	0	sociology
 Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions .	1	sociology
 In education , examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades , truancy , dropping out , not graduating , and not finding suitable employment .	0	sociology
 5356 . For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message .	0	sociology
 The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922–1982 ) to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis .	0	sociology
 Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “ scripts . ” Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958).Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods , such as in - depth interviews or participant observation , because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live .	1	sociology
 5359 . Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .	0	sociology
 Researchers Rotton and Kelly ( 1985 ) conducted a meta - analysis of research on the full moon ’s effects on behavior .	0	sociology
 Meta - analysis is a technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are evaluated together .	1	sociology
 5362 . In this field , results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before — knowledge of other cultures , knowledge of rituals and beliefs , or knowledge of trends and attitudes .	0	sociology
 No matter what research approach they use , researchers want to maximize the study ’s reliability , which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced .	1	sociology
 Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .	0	sociology
 5365 . The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review , which is a review of any existing similar or related studies .	0	sociology
 A visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study .	0	sociology
 5368 . In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .	1	sociology
 The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .	1	sociology
 5371 . Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research .	0	sociology
 In planning studies ' designs , sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation : survey , field research , experiment , and secondary data analysis , or use of existing sources .	0	sociology
 Every research method comes with plusses and minuses , and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use . Surveys	0	sociology
 5374 . A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .	0	sociology
 Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .	1	sociology
 The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .	0	sociology
 5377 . People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously .	0	sociology
 This type of information is qualitative data — results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting .	1	sociology
 Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate .	0	sociology
 5380 . Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation .	0	sociology
 And while field research looks for correlation , its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables .	0	sociology
 5383 . Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event .	0	sociology
 A case study is an in - depth analysis of a single event , situation , or individual .	1	sociology
 To conduct a case study , a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records , conducts interviews , engages in direct observation and even participant observation , if possible . Researchers might use this method to study a single case of , for example , a foster child , drug lord , cancer patient , criminal , or rape victim .	0	sociology
 5386 . One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research ( or unobtrusive research ) , meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people ’s behaviors .	1	sociology
 Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people , using previously published data does n’t require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process .	0	sociology
 5389 . While he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values , he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses .	0	sociology
 Sociologists , he stated , must establish value neutrality , a practice of remaining impartial , without bias or judgment , during the course of a study and in publishing results ( 1949 ) .	1	sociology
 Sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data .	0	sociology
 5392 . Nonmaterial culture , in contrast , consists of the ideas , attitudes , and beliefs of a society .	1	sociology
 Material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked , and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas .	0	sociology
 5395 . The first , and perhaps most crucial , elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs .	0	sociology
 Values are a culture ’s standard for discerning what is good and just in society .	1	sociology
 Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .	0	sociology
 5398 . Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .	1	sociology
 But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .	1	sociology
 In an ideal culture , there would be no traffic accidents , murders , poverty , or racial tension .	0	sociology
 5401 . These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured , or what sociologists call norms .	1	sociology
 Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good , right , and important , and most members of the society adhere to them .	0	sociology
 5404 . Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by . Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways .	0	sociology
 Mores ( mor - ays ) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group .	1	sociology
 Violating them can have serious consequences .	0	sociology
 5407 . While different cultures have varying systems of symbols , one symbol is common to all : language .	0	sociology
 Language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted .	1	sociology
 Some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication , while others rely on only spoken communication and nonverbal actions .	0	sociology
 5410 . The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society .	1	sociology
 Popular culture events might include a parade , a baseball game , or the season finale of a television show .	0	sociology
 5413 . An innovation refers to an object or concept ’s initial appearance in society — it ’s innovative because it is markedly new .	1	sociology
 There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .	0	sociology
 5416 . Material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture ; technology can spread through society in a matter of months , but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change .	0	sociology
 Sociologist William F. Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture ( Ogburn 1957 ) .	1	sociology
 Culture lag can also cause tangible problems .	0	sociology
 5419 . Exactly what is a society ?	0	sociology
 In sociological terms , society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community and share the same culture .	1	sociology
 On a broader scale , society consists of the people and institutions around us , our shared beliefs , and our cultural ideas .	0	sociology
 5422 . Previously , the depletion of a region ’s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock .	0	sociology
 Horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops .	0	sociology
 They were similar to hunter - gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival , but since they did n’t have to abandon their location to follow resources , they were able to start permanent settlements .	0	sociology
 5425 . Postindustrial SocietyInformation societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development .	0	sociology
 Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services .	1	sociology
 5428 . In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .	0	sociology
 Durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life . Following the ideas of Comte and Spencer , Durkheim likened society to a living organism , in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive .	1	sociology
 Even the socially deviant members of society are necessary , Durkheim argued , as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms .	0	sociology
 5431 . Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge .	0	sociology
 While the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is , in the long run , advantageous for a society , Durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and “ normlessness . ” One of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie .	0	sociology
 Anomie — literally , “ without law”—is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness .	1	sociology
 5434 . Marx described modern society in terms of alienation .	0	sociology
 Alienation refers to the condition in which the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society , work , or the sense of self .	1	sociology
 Marx defined four specific types of alienation .	0	sociology
 5437 . Weber ’s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization .	0	sociology
 A rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition .	1	sociology
 5440 . In a sense , it exists by consensus , both prior and current .	0	sociology
 This is an example of the process of institutionalization , the act of implanting a convention or norm into society .	1	sociology
 Bear in mind that the institution , while socially constructed , is still quite real .	0	sociology
 5443 . Roles and StatusAs you can imagine , people employ many types of behaviors in day - to - day life .	0	sociology
 Roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person ’s social status .	1	sociology
 Currently , while reading this text , you are playing the role of a student .	0	sociology
 5446 . Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .	1	sociology
 Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .	1	sociology
 As a daughter or son , you occupy a different status than as a neighbor or employee .	0	sociology
 5449 . Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .	0	sociology
 Similarly , a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory .	0	sociology
 A parent who also has a full - time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis .	0	sociology
 5455 . In the 1850s , as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved , suburbs developed .	0	sociology
 Suburbs are the communities surrounding cities , typically close enough for a daily commute in , but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords .	1	sociology
 The bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl .	0	sociology
 5458 . Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .	0	sociology
 New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .	1	sociology
 These metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the U.S. landscape . The suburban sprawl in Toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion .	0	sociology
 5461 . The world ’s most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south , a marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north .	0	sociology
 In the next forty years , the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations , particularly in less developed countries , will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment , also called sustainable development ( United Nations , Department of Economic and Social Affairs , Population Division 2014 ) .	1	sociology
 5464 . The subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments .	1	sociology
 This field is closely related to human ecology , which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment .	1	sociology
 5467 . And it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment .	0	sociology
 E - waste is the name for obsolete , broken , and worn - out electronics — from computers to mobile phones to televisions .	1	sociology
 The challenge is that these products , which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence ( the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics ) , have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them , which makes for a dangerous combination .	1	sociology
 5470 . Without regular interaction — the holding , hugging , talking , the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children — she had not learned to walk or to speak , to eat or to interact , to play or even to understand the world around her .	0	sociology
 From a sociological point of view , Danielle had not been socialized . Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .	1	sociology
 It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .	0	sociology
 5473 . Sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate ( the number of live births per 1,000 people per year ) .	1	sociology
 Just as fertility measures childbearing , the mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die .	1	sociology
 The crude death rate is a number derived from the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year .	1	sociology
 5482 . Moral development is an important part of the socialization process .	0	sociology
 The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society .	1	sociology
 5485 . Fracking , another word for hydraulic fracturing , is a method used to recover gas and oil from shale by drilling down into the earth and directing a high - pressure mixture of water , sand , and proprietary chemicals into the rock .	1	sociology
 Commonly , this process also includes drilling horizontally into the rock to create new pathways for gas to travel .	0	sociology
 5488 . First , members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation ceremony .	0	sociology
 In a degradation ceremony , new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities .	1	sociology
 The process is sometimes gentle .	0	sociology
 5494 . Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .	1	sociology
 These people are considered a category , and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000 are referred to as “ Millennials . ” Why are Millennials a category and not a group ?	1	sociology
 Because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other . Interestingly , people within an aggregate or category can become a group .	0	sociology
 5497 . They may also be task - focused and time - limited .	0	sociology
 These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal- or task - oriented than emotional .	0	sociology
 A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group .	0	sociology
 5500 . A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad .	1	sociology
 Georg Simmel ( 1858–1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two - member group , and a triad , which is a three - member group ( Simmel 1902 ) .	1	sociology
 In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist .	0	sociology
 5506 . A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .	0	sociology
 In contrast , a laissez - faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands - off , allowing group members to self - manage and make their own decisions .	1	sociology
 An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art .	0	sociology
 5512 . The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations .	0	sociology
 Coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced , or pushed , to join .	1	sociology
 These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .	0	sociology
 5515 . People often complain about bureaucracies––declaring them slow , rule - bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly .	0	sociology
 Let ’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors .	1	sociology
 For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks .	0	sociology
 5518 . Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations .	1	sociology
 This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization .	0	sociology
 5521 . The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions .	1	sociology
 This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) .	0	sociology
 5524 . All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .	1	sociology
 The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .	0	sociology
 Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .	0	sociology
 5527 . A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .	0	sociology
 Negative sanctions are punishments for violating norms .	1	sociology
 Being arrested is a punishment for shoplifting .	0	sociology
 5530 . Sociologist Robert Merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society , but he expanded on Durkheim ’s ideas by developing strain theory , which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates .	1	sociology
 From birth , we ’re encouraged to achieve the “ American Dream ” of financial success .	0	sociology
 5533 . Conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance .	1	sociology
 Unlike functionalists , conflict theorists do n’t see these factors as positive functions of society .	0	sociology
 5536 . Those who do , however , have often been labeled “ deviant ” by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves .	0	sociology
 Labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society .	1	sociology
 Thus , what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them , but by the reactions of others to these behaviors .	0	sociology
 5545 . If you use a crowbar to break into a car , you are committing a nonviolent crime ; if you mug someone with the crowbar , you are committing a violent crime .	0	sociology
 When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .	0	sociology
 An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .	1	sociology
 5548 . Both victims were drugged , sodomized , and forced to burn one another with cigarettes .	0	sociology
 When questioned by police , the ringleader of the crime explained that the victims were gay and “ looked like [ they ] liked it ” ( Wilson and Baker 2010).Attacks based on a person ’s race , religion , or other characteristics are known as hate crimes .	1	sociology
 Hate crimes in the United States evolved from the time of early European settlers and their violence toward Native Americans .	0	sociology
 5551 . Police are a civil force in charge of enforcing laws and public order at a federal , state , or community level .	1	sociology
 No unified national police force exists in the United States , although there are federal law enforcement officers .	0	sociology
 5554 . It is easy to look at the latest sleek Apple product and think technology is a recent addition to our world .	0	sociology
 But from the steam engine to the most cutting - edge robotic surgery tools , technology has described the application of science to address the problems of daily life .	0	sociology
 We might look back at the enormous and clunky computers of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an iPod Shuffle and roll our eyes in disbelief .	0	sociology
 5557 . Numerous facts sheets available through the government , nonprofits , and the private sector outline common safety measures , including the following : become familiar with privacy rights ; read privacy policies when making a purchase ( rather than simply clicking “ accept ” ) ; give out only the minimum information requested by any source ; ask why information is being collected , how it is going to be used , and who will have access it ; and monitor your credit history for red flags that indicate your identity has been compromised .	0	sociology
 Net NeutralityThe issue of net neutrality , the principle that all Internet data should be treated equally by Internet service providers , is part of the national debate about Internet access and the digital divide .	0	sociology
 On one side of this debate is the belief that those who provide Internet service , like those who provide electricity and water , should be treated as common carriers , legally prohibited from discriminating based on the customer or nature of the goods .	0	sociology
 5560 . Theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system , as with most other social problems , are rooted in capitalist society .	0	sociology
 According to conflict theorists , capitalism and the pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health : the changing of something not generally thought of as a commodity into something that can be bought and sold in a marketplace .	0	sociology
 In this view , people with money and power — the dominant group — are the ones who make decisions about how the healthcare system will be run .	0	sociology
 5563 . HealthcareU.S .	0	sociology
 healthcare coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories : public healthcare ( government - funded ) and private healthcare ( privately funded ) .	0	sociology
 The two main publicly funded healthcare programs are Medicare , which provides health services to people over sixty - five years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability , and Medicaid , which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements .	1	sociology
 5566 . One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine , a term that for many people in the United States has negative connotations lingering from the Cold War era and earlier .	0	sociology
 Under a socialized medicine system , the government owns and runs the system .	1	sociology
 It employs the doctors , nurses , and other staff , and it owns and runs the hospitals ( Klein 2009 ) .	0	sociology
 5569 . The discrepancy between black and white Americans shows the gap clearly ; in 2008 , the average life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males : 75.9 compared to 70.9 .	0	sociology
 An even stronger disparity was found in 2007 : the infant mortality , which is the number of deaths in a given time or place , rate for blacks was nearly twice that of whites at 13.2 compared to 5.6 per 1,000 live births ( U.S. Census Bureau 2011 ) .	0	sociology
 According to a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation ( 2007 ) , African Americans also have higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality , from cancer to heart disease to diabetes .	0	sociology
 5572 . In the post - millennial United States , those of us who have never experienced such a disadvantage take for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen .	0	sociology
 We do not think about the relatively recent nature of the protections , unless , of course , we know someone constantly inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations or misfortune of suddenly experiencing a temporary disability . Mental HealthPeople with mental disorders ( a condition that makes it more difficult to cope with everyday life ) and people with mental illness ( a severe , lasting mental disorder that requires long - term treatment ) experience a wide range of effects . According to the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , the most common mental disorders in the United States are anxiety disorders .	1	sociology
 Almost 18 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .	0	sociology
 5575 . Disability refers to a reduction in one ’s ability to perform everyday tasks .	1	sociology
 The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 5578 . Even after slavery was abolished in 1865 , the next 100 years of U.S. history saw institutionalized racism and prejudice against black people .	0	sociology
 In an example of stereotype interchangeability , the same insults that are flung today at the overweight and obese population ( lazy , for instance ) , have been flung at various racial and ethnic groups in earlier history .	0	sociology
 Of course , no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now , except when talking about obese people . Why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward — even to hate — obese people ?	0	sociology
 5581 . In essence , Goffman ( 1963 ) suggests we might view illness as a stigma that can push others to view the ill in an undesirable manner .	0	sociology
 The stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives .	0	sociology
 Many contend that our society and even our healthcare institutions discriminate against certain diseases — like mental disorders , AIDS , venereal diseases , and skin disorders ( Sartorius 2007 ) .	0	sociology
 5584 . This regulatory body will patent three types of innovation .	0	sociology
 Utility patents are the first type .	0	sociology
 These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .	1	sociology
 5587 . Anderson and Tushman ( 1990 ) suggest an evolutionary model of technological change , in which a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of variations .	1	sociology
 Once those are assessed , a prototype emerges , and then a period of slight adjustments to the technology , interrupted by a breakthrough .	0	sociology
 5590 . In this section , we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective .	0	sociology
 As the names suggest , media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross - cultural exchange of ideas , while technological globalization refers to the cross - cultural development and exchange of technology .	1	sociology
 5593 . Technological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion , the spread of technology across borders .	1	sociology
 In the last two decades , there has been rapid improvement in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi - peripheral nations , and a 2008 World Bank report discusses both the benefits and ongoing challenges of this diffusion .	0	sociology
 5596 . Social scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is an entire journal devoted to its study , Surveillance and Society .	0	sociology
 The panoptic surveillance envisioned by Jeremy Bentham , depicted in the form of an all - powerful , all - seeing government by George Orwell in 1984 , and later analyzed by Michel Foucault ( 1975 ) is increasingly realized in the form of technology used to monitor our every move .	0	sociology
 This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly .	0	sociology
 1 . What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines ?	0	biology
 Science ( from the Latin scientia , meaning “ knowledge ” ) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws , especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method .	1	biology
 It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science .	0	biology
 4 . A hypothesis may become a verified theory .	0	biology
 A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena .	1	biology
 Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe .	1	biology
 10 . A valid hypothesis must be testable .	0	biology
 It should also be falsifiable , meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results .	0	biology
 Importantly , science does not claim to “ prove ” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information .	0	biology
 13 . Basic science or “ pure ” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short - term application of that knowledge .	0	biology
 It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value .	0	biology
 16 . Instead , most scientists present their results in peer - reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals .	0	biology
 Peer - reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist ’s colleagues , or peers .	1	biology
 These colleagues are qualified individuals , often experts in the same research area , who judge whether or not the scientist ’s work is suitable for publication .	0	biology
 19 . The introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal .	0	biology
 Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism .	1	biology
 22 . The results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .	0	biology
 In the discussion section , the researcher will interpret the results , describe how variables may be related , and attempt to explain the observations .	0	biology
 It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research .	0	biology
 25 . These conditions may , however , change from one moment to the next .	0	biology
 Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly , despite environmental changes , through homeostasis ( literally , “ steady state”)—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions .	1	biology
 For example , an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation .	0	biology
 28 . A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .	1	biology
 Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .	1	biology
 An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( [ link ] ) , which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms .	1	biology
 31 . Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic .	0	biology
 Prokaryotes are single - celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane - bound nuclei ; in contrast , the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane - bound organelles and a membrane - bound nucleus .	1	biology
 34 . Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants .	0	biology
 An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs .	1	biology
 Mammals have many organ systems .	0	biology
 37 . For example , the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations .	0	biology
 A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area .	0	biology
 For instance , all of the trees , flowers , insects , and other populations in a forest form the forest ’s community .	0	biology
 40 . The fact that biology , as a science , has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth .	0	biology
 The source of this diversity is evolution , the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species .	0	biology
 Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems .	0	biology
 43 . For instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .	0	biology
 Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .	0	biology
 It is quite a broad branch itself , and depending on the subject of study , there are also microbial physiologists , ecologists , and geneticists , among others .	0	biology
 46 . Paleontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .	0	biology
 Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists , ecologists , or physiologists , to name just a few areas .	0	biology
 49 . To understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element , the atom .	0	biology
 An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element .	0	biology
 For example , one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature .	0	biology
 52 . Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .	0	biology
 Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit .	0	biology
 Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass .	0	biology
 55 . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number .	0	biology
 Since an element ’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes .	0	biology
 Often , the resulting number contains a fraction .	0	biology
 58 . The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table .	0	biology
 Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( 1834–1907 ) in 1869 , the table groups elements that , although unique , share certain chemical properties with other elements .	0	biology
 61 . An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr ( 1885–1962 ) .	0	biology
 The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons , with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 These orbits form electron shells or energy levels , which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells .	0	biology
 64 . Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration , while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable .	0	biology
 As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions .	0	biology
 Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions .	0	biology
 67 . This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable .	0	biology
 However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration .	0	biology
 When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other , the resultant chemical structure is a molecule .	0	biology
 70 . In the equation below , the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules .	0	biology
 This is an example of a balanced chemical equation , wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation .	1	biology
 According to the law of conservation of matter , the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal , such that no atoms are , under normal circumstances , created or destroyed .	1	biology
 73 . The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .	0	biology
 Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .	0	biology
 In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .	0	biology
 76 . Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons , each ion has a net charge .	0	biology
 Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons .	1	biology
 Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .	1	biology
 79 . Ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges .	1	biology
 For instance , positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride , or table salt , creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge .	0	biology
 82 . There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar .	0	biology
 In a polar covalent bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other .	1	biology
 Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ+ ) or slightly negative ( δ– ) charge develops .	0	biology
 85 . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule .	1	biology
 This interaction is called a hydrogen bond .	0	biology
 This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules .	0	biology
 88 . In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .	1	biology
 These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -phobic = “ fearing ” ) .	0	biology
 91 . Water also has a high heat of vaporization , the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas .	1	biology
 A considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 cal ) is required to accomplish this change in water .	0	biology
 94 . The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .	1	biology
 This is referred to as a sphere of hydration , or a hydration shell , as illustrated in [ link ] and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water . When ionic compounds are added to water , the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation .	0	biology
 Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions .	1	biology
 97 . These cohesive forces are related to water ’s property of adhesion , or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules .	1	biology
 This attraction is sometimes stronger than water ’s cohesive forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes .	0	biology
 100 . Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH .	0	biology
 An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .	1	biology
 A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH– ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .	1	biology
 103 . Buffers are the key .	0	biology
 Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH– , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival .	1	biology
 Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’s well - being .	0	biology
 106 . So far , the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons , which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 Another type of hydrocarbon , aromatic hydrocarbons , consists of closed rings of carbon atoms .	1	biology
 109 . Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .	1	biology
 Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .	1	biology
 For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans . Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds .	1	biology
 112 . Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules .	1	biology
 They are found along the “ carbon backbone ” of macromolecules .	0	biology
 115 . Most macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called monomers .	1	biology
 The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers .	1	biology
 118 . Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed , or “ sped up , ” by specific enzymes ; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds , requiring energy , while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy .	1	biology
 These reactions are similar for most macromolecules , but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class .	0	biology
 121 . Monosaccharides ( mono- = “ one ” ; sacchar- = “ sweet ” ) are simple sugars , the most common of which is glucose .	1	biology
 In monosaccharides , the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven .	0	biology
 124 . PolysaccharidesA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide ( poly- = “ many ” ) .	1	biology
 The chain may be branched or unbranched , and it may contain different types of monosaccharides .	0	biology
 127 . Arthropods ( insects , crustaceans , and others ) have an outer skeleton , called the exoskeleton , which protects their internal body parts ( as seen in the bee in [ link ] ) . This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin , which is a polysaccharide - containing nitrogen .	1	biology
 It is made of repeating units of N - acetyl - β - d - glucosamine , a modified sugar .	0	biology
 130 . Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .	0	biology
 For example , palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , is derived from the palm tree .	1	biology
 Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea , the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts .	1	biology
 133 . Consequently , they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet .	0	biology
 Omega-3 fatty acids ( like that shown in [ link ] ) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans ( the other being omega-6 fatty acid ) .	0	biology
 These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond .	0	biology
 136 . Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier , steroids have a fused ring structure .	0	biology
 Although they do not resemble the other lipids , they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water .	0	biology
 139 . Hormones are chemical - signaling molecules , usually small proteins or steroids , secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes , including growth , development , metabolism , and reproduction .	1	biology
 For example , insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level .	0	biology
 142 . The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein 's shape , size , and function .	0	biology
 Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond , known as a peptide bond , which is formed by a dehydration reaction .	1	biology
 The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine , releasing a molecule of water .	0	biology
 145 . The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .	0	biology
 The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds .	1	biology
 148 . It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process .	0	biology
 Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones ( or chaperonins ) that associate with the target protein during the folding process .	1	biology
 They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure , and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded .	0	biology
 151 . The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell .	1	biology
 This intermediary is the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .	0	biology
 Other types of RNA — like rRNA , tRNA , and microRNA — are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation .	0	biology
 154 . Adenine and guanine are classified as purines .	0	biology
 The primary structure of a purine is two carbon - nitrogen rings .	0	biology
 157 . In this way , the mRNA is read and the protein product is made .	0	biology
 Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds .	1	biology
 The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids .	0	biology
 160 . With few exceptions , individual cells can not be seen with the naked eye , so scientists use microscopes ( micro- = “ small ” ; -scope = “ to look at ” ) to study them .	0	biology
 A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object .	1	biology
 Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope , and these images can also be called micrographs . The optics of a microscope ’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees .	1	biology
 163 . By the late 1830s , botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory , which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells , the cell is the basic unit of life , and new cells arise from existing cells .	1	biology
 Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory .	0	biology
 166 . Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function , especially in cell biology , and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , rod - shaped chromosomes .	1	biology
 Because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” The word “ organelle ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions . At this point , it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells .	1	biology
 169 . The cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .	1	biology
 It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water , it has a semi - solid consistency , which comes from the proteins within it .	0	biology
 172 . The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions , molecules , and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm .	1	biology
 The nucleoplasm is the semi - solid fluid inside the nucleus , where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus .	1	biology
 175 . Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA .	0	biology
 A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus ( plural = nucleoli ) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm .	1	biology
 178 . Peroxisomes are small , round organelles enclosed by single membranes .	1	biology
 They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids .	0	biology
 181 . Animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells : lysosomes .	0	biology
 The lysosomes are the cell ’s “ garbage disposal . ” In plant cells , the digestive processes take place in vacuoles .	1	biology
 Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins , polysaccharides , lipids , nucleic acids , and even worn - out organelles .	0	biology
 184 . The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll , which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis .	1	biology
 Like plant cells , photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts .	0	biology
 187 . MicrofilamentsOf the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton , microfilaments are the narrowest .	0	biology
 They function in cellular movement , have a diameter of about 7 nm , and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 190 . To refresh your memory , flagella ( singular = flagellum ) are long , hair - like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell ( for example , sperm , Euglena ) .	1	biology
 When present , the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella .	0	biology
 193 . Such transport uses the vascular tissues ( xylem and phloem ) primarily .	0	biology
 There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata ( singular = plasmodesma ) , numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells , connect their cytoplasm , and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell , and thus throughout the plant ( [ link]).A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells .	1	biology
 Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell .	0	biology
 196 . Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions , nutrients , and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Structurally , however , gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ .	0	biology
 199 . The main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic , phospholipid molecules .	0	biology
 The hydrophilic or “ water - loving ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of balls in an artist ’s rendition of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell .	1	biology
 Hydrophobic , or water - hating molecules , tend to be non - polar .	1	biology
 202 . Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes .	0	biology
 Integral proteins ( some specialized types are called integrins ) are , as their name suggests , integrated completely into the membrane structure , and their hydrophobic membrane - spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Single - pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids .	0	biology
 205 . The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive .	0	biology
 Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement .	1	biology
 In passive transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration .	0	biology
 208 . In filtration , material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane ; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure , causing the substances to filter more rapidly .	1	biology
 This occurs in the kidney , where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances , or solutes , out of the blood and into the renal tubules .	1	biology
 The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure .	0	biology
 211 . Channels are specific for the substance that is being transported .	0	biology
 Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids ; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell .	0	biology
 214 . Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane , which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes .	1	biology
 While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells , osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water .	0	biology
 217 . A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .	0	biology
 Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution .	1	biology
 A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles ; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles .	0	biology
 220 . In an isotonic solution , the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell .	1	biology
 If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid , there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell , although water will still move in and out .	0	biology
 223 . The electrical gradient of K+ , a positive ion , also tends to drive it into the cell , but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+ out of the cell ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient .	1	biology
 226 . Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .	1	biology
 Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .	1	biology
 229 . A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .	1	biology
 A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .	1	biology
 An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules , but in different directions .	1	biology
 232 . Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles , such as large molecules , parts of cells , and even whole cells , into a cell .	1	biology
 There are different variations of endocytosis , but all share a common characteristic : The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates , forming a pocket around the target particle .	0	biology
 235 . A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis .	0	biology
 This process uses a coating protein , called caveolin , on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , which performs a similar function to clathrin .	1	biology
 238 . The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis .	0	biology

 Because counting microstates and macrostates involves statistics , this is called statistical analysis .	0	physics
 The macrostates of a gas correspond to its macroscopic properties , such as volume , temperature , and pressure ; and its microstates correspond to the detailed description of the positions and velocities of its atoms .	0	physics
 2887 . Consider , for example , plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in [ link ] .	0	physics
 The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction , known as a restoring force .	0	physics
 Once released , the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position , where the net force on it is zero .	1	physics
 2890 . For small displacements , a pendulum is a simple harmonic oscillator .	1	physics
 A simple pendulum is defined to have an object that has a small mass , also known as the pendulum bob , which is suspended from a light wire or string , such as shown in [ link ] .	1	physics
 Exploring the simple pendulum a bit further , we can discover the conditions under which it performs simple harmonic motion , and we can derive an interesting expression for its period .	0	physics
 2893 . Such a system is underdamped ; its displacement is represented by the curve in [ link ] .	0	physics
 Curve B in [ link ] represents an overdamped system .	0	physics
 As with critical damping , it too may overshoot the equilibrium position , but will reach equilibrium over a longer period of time .	0	physics
 2896 . The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance .	1	physics
 A system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate .	0	physics
 As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency , the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller , until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball .	0	physics
 2899 . The wave in [ link ] propagates in the horizontal direction while the surface is disturbed in the vertical direction .	0	physics
 Such a wave is called a transverse wave or shear wave ; in such a wave , the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation .	1	physics
 In contrast , in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave , the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation .	1	physics
 2902 . The crests of the two waves are precisely aligned , as are the troughs .	0	physics
 This superposition produces pure constructive interference .	0	physics
 Because the disturbances add , pure constructive interference produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the individual waves , but has the same wavelength .	1	physics
 2905 . [ link ] and [ link ] show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends .	0	physics
 Nodes are the points where the string does not move ; more generally , nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave .	1	physics
 The fixed ends of strings must be nodes , too , because the string can not move there .	0	physics
 2908 . The wave resulting from the superposition of two similar - frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the two .	0	physics
 This wave fluctuates in amplitude , or beats , with a frequency called the beat frequency .	0	physics
 We can determine the beat frequency by adding two waves together mathematically .	0	physics
 2911 . You can also directly sense the frequency of a sound .	0	physics
 Perception of frequency is called pitch .	1	physics
 The wavelength of sound is not directly sensed , but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the size of musical instruments with their pitch .	0	physics
 2914 . The lack of contrast makes image interpretation very difficult .	0	physics
 Contrast is the difference in intensity between objects and the background on which they are observed .	1	physics
 Stains ( such as dyes , fluorophores , etc . )	0	physics
 2917 . A polarization microscope also enhances contrast by utilizing a wave characteristic of light .	1	physics
 Polarization microscopes are useful for objects that are optically active or birefringent , particularly if those characteristics vary from place to place in the object .	0	physics
 2920 . The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement ( an antinode ) at the open end , where motion is unconstrained , and no displacement ( a node ) at the closed end , where air movement is halted .	0	physics
 The distance from a node to an antinode is one - fourth of a wavelength , and this equals the length of the tube ; thus , λ=4Lλ=4L size 12{λ=4L } { } .	0	physics
 2923 . Hearing is the perception of sound .	1	physics
 ( Perception is commonly defined to be awareness through the senses , a typically circular definition of higher - level processes in living organisms . )	1	physics
 2926 . Pitch perception is directly related to frequency and is not greatly affected by other physical quantities such as intensity .	1	physics
 Musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments and in Western music have particular names .	1	physics
 Combinations of notes constitute music .	1	physics
 2929 . This is true for other perceptions of sound , such as music and noise .	0	physics
 We shall not delve further into them ; rather , we will concentrate on the question of loudness perception . A unit called a phon is used to express loudness numerically .	0	physics
 Phons differ from decibels because the phon is a unit of loudness perception , whereas the decibel is a unit of physical intensity .	1	physics
 2932 . Atomic and molecular interactions , such as the forces of friction , cohesion , and adhesion , are now known to be manifestations of the electromagnetic force .	0	physics
 Static electricity is just one aspect of the electromagnetic force , which also includes moving electricity and magnetism .	0	physics
 2935 . Today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms , and that atoms contain positive and negative charges , usually in equal amounts .	0	physics
 [ link ] shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus .	0	physics
 The nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons .	1	physics
 Nearly all charge in nature is due to electrons and protons , which are two of the three building blocks of most matter .	0	physics
 2938 . These free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand .	0	physics
 Any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor .	1	physics
 The moving electrons may collide with fixed atoms and molecules , losing some energy , but they can move in a conductor .	0	physics
 3319 . A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .	0	psychology
 Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 ( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .	1	psychology
 ( b ) Phenotype describes an individual ’s observable characteristics , such as hair color , skin color , height , and build .	0	psychology
 3322 . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .	1	psychology
 When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele .	1	psychology
 When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous .	1	psychology
 3325 . ( a ) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring .	1	psychology
 The capital B represents the dominant allele , and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele .	0	psychology
 3328 . Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .	1	psychology
 Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .	0	psychology
 If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU , their offspring have a 25 % chance of expressing the PKU phenotype .	0	psychology

 3340 . Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system , 100 billion strong at birth .	1	psychology
 Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3343 . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .	1	psychology
 The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .	0	psychology
 The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .	1	psychology
 3346 . Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet .	0	psychology
 In some axons , glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath , which coats the axon and acts as an insulator , increasing the speed at which the signal travels .	1	psychology
 The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function .	0	psychology
 3349 . We begin at the neuronal membrane .	0	psychology
 The neuron exists in a fluid environment — it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid ( i.e. , cytoplasm ) .	1	psychology
 The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .	0	psychology
 3355 . The action potential is an all - or - none phenomenon .	0	psychology
 In simple terms , this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation .	1	psychology
 3358 . There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons , and we can speak in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders .	0	psychology
 3361 . Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system .	1	psychology
 Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .	1	psychology
 An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .	1	psychology
 3364 . The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary .	1	psychology
 It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS ; therefore , it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons .	0	psychology
 3367 . The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .	0	psychology
 Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium , in which biological conditions ( such as body temperature ) are maintained at optimal levels .	1	psychology
 3370 . The Spinal CordIt can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world .	1	psychology
 Because of it , the brain can act .	0	psychology
 3373 . There is evidence of some specialization of function — referred to as lateralization — in each hemisphere , mainly regarding differences in language ability .	1	psychology
 Beyond that , however , the differences that have been found have been minor .	0	psychology
 3376 . Lobes of the BrainThe four lobes of the brain are the frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital lobes ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain , extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus .	1	psychology
 The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .	0	psychology
 3379 . Gage 's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over localization — regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions .	1	psychology
 On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage , the extent of his injury , and his life before and after the accident , scientists tended to find support for their own views , on whichever side of the debate they fell ( Macmillan , 1999 ) .	0	psychology
 ( a ) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction accident .	0	psychology
 ( b ) Gage ’s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere .	0	psychology
 3382 . The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .	1	psychology
 The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .	1	psychology
 3385 . The occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain , and contains the primary visual cortex , which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information .	1	psychology
 The occipital cortex is organized retinotopically , which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person ’s visual field and the position of that object ’s representation on the cortex .	1	psychology
 3388 . The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory .	1	psychology
 Interestingly , the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system ; therefore , not surprisingly , smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not .	0	psychology
 3391 . The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .	1	psychology
 The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior .	0	psychology
 3394 . Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .	1	psychology
 The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep / wake cycle , arousal , alertness , and motor activity .	0	psychology
 3397 . It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .	1	psychology
 The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .	1	psychology
 3400 . On February 25 , 1990 , a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest , apparently triggered by a bulimic episode .	0	psychology
 She was eventually revived , but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time .	0	psychology
 3403 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans create pictures of the living , active brain ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance , called a tracer .	1	psychology
 3406 . In some situations , it is helpful to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person ’s brain , without needing information on the actual location of the activity .	0	psychology
 Electroencephalography ( EEG ) serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain ’s electrical activity .	1	psychology
 An array of electrodes is placed around a person ’s head ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3409 . Located in the neck , the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth , metabolism , and appetite .	1	psychology
 In hyperthyroidism , or Grave ’s disease , the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine , causing agitation , bulging eyes , and weight loss .	1	psychology
 3412 . These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .	0	psychology
 People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . The gonads secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior .	1	psychology
 The female gonads are the ovaries ; the male gonads are the testes .	1	psychology
 3415 . Visit this website to see an example of a consent form . While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing , sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study .	0	psychology
 Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment , but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful .	1	psychology
 For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .	0	psychology
 3418 . Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects .	0	psychology
 Often , these researchers use rodents ( [ link ] ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments — the APA estimates that 90 % of all animal research in psychology uses these species ( American Psychological Association , n.d . ) .	0	psychology
 Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans , these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants .	1	psychology
 3421 . We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient .	0	psychology
 A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to + 1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables .	1	psychology
 The correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter r .	0	psychology
 3424 . Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables .	1	psychology
 However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .	1	psychology
 While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .	0	psychology
 3427 . We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations , especially with unsystematic observations .	0	psychology
 Illusory correlations , or false correlations , occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists .	1	psychology
 One well - known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon ’s phases have on human behavior .	0	psychology
 3430 . In order to conduct an experiment , a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested .	0	psychology
 As you ’ve learned , hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research .	1	psychology
 3433 . Ideally , the people who observe and record the children ’s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group , in order to control for experimenter bias .	0	psychology
 Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher ’s expectations might skew the results of the study .	1	psychology
 Remember , conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning , and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses .	0	psychology
 3436 . Because by doing so , we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations .	0	psychology
 If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration .	0	psychology
 The placebo effect occurs when people 's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation .	1	psychology
 3439 . Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include .	0	psychology
 Participants are the subjects of psychological research , and as the name implies , individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process .	1	psychology
 Often , psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants .	0	psychology
 3442 . Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design .	0	psychology
 With sufficiently large samples , random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups .	1	psychology
 3445 . Poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out , and even well - designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested .	0	psychology
 Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it , meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability .	1	psychology
 Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding .	0	psychology
 3448 . In observational research , scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just a few individuals .	1	psychology
 Indeed , some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals .	0	psychology
 3451 . The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another .	0	psychology
 The anthropologist Jane Goodall , for example , spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation , some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers — using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study ( McKie , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3454 . To protect against this type of bias , researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified .	0	psychology
 In addition , researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers , in order to test inter - rater reliability : a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers .	1	psychology
 3457 . Instead , they use existing records to answer various research questions .	0	psychology
 This type of research approach is known as archival research .	0	psychology
 Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships .	1	psychology
 3460 . Even without significant life changes , some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project .	0	psychology
 As a result , the attrition rates , or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts , in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project .	1	psychology
 For this reason , researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end .	0	psychology
 3463 . In the end , research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions .	0	psychology
 Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .	1	psychology
 In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .	0	psychology
 3466 . We ’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas , but what sort of ideas are they , exactly ?	0	psychology
 A theory is a well - developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena .	1	psychology
 Theories are repeatedly checked against the world , but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once ; instead , researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory .	0	psychology
 3469 . A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .	1	psychology
 Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 However , a major criticism of Freud ’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable ; for example , it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the i d , the ego , and the superego — the three elements of personality described in Freud ’s theories .	0	psychology
 3472 . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism .	0	psychology
 An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .	1	psychology
 3475 . In some areas in psychology , it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty .	0	psychology
 In most cases , young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full - time faculty position .	0	psychology
 3478 . As the name suggests , biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior .	1	psychology
 While biological psychology is a broad field , many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3481 . As mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior .	1	psychology
 Thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions .	1	psychology
 Like biological psychology , cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds .	0	psychology
 3484 . Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique .	1	psychology
 Several individuals ( e.g. , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality .	0	psychology
 3487 . Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others .	1	psychology
 Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others , prejudice , and attraction , and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts .	1	psychology
 3490 . Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors .	1	psychology
 This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3493 . Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior .	1	psychology
 As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .	0	psychology
 3496 . Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system .	1	psychology
 For example , forensic psychologists ( and forensic psychiatrists ) will assess a person ’s competency to stand trial , assess the state of mind of a defendant , act as consultants on child custody cases , consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations , and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children ’s testimony ( American Board of Forensic Psychology , 2014 ) .	0	psychology
 3499 . These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it can not be seen by any other person .	0	psychology
 This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism .	1	psychology
 Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3502 . Perhaps one of the most influential and well - known figures in psychology ’s history was Sigmund Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Freud ( 1856–1939 ) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “ hysteria ” and neurosis .	0	psychology
 3505 . Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) .	0	psychology
 Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex , in which an animal or human produced a reflex ( unconscious ) response to a stimulus and , over time , was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus .	1	psychology
 3508 . Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior . B .	0	psychology
 F. Skinner ( 1904–1990 ) was an American psychologist ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences .	0	psychology
 3511 . Abraham Maslow ( 1908–1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here .	0	psychology
 3514 . Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli .	1	psychology
 Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain , hunger , thirst , sleepiness , and being aware of our thoughts and emotions .	0	psychology
 3517 . Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity .	1	psychology
 A woman ’s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm — a recurring , cyclical pattern of bodily changes .	0	psychology
 3520 . In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .	1	psychology
 Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance , or optimal level , within a biological system .	1	psychology
 3523 . One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .	1	psychology
 The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .	1	psychology
 Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light .	1	psychology
 3526 . Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .	1	psychology
 These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 3529 . As we grow older , we sleep less .	0	psychology
 In fact , a meta - analysis , which is a study that combines the results of many related studies , conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old , we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day ( Ohayon , Carskadon , Guilleminault , & Vitiello , 2004 ) .	1	psychology
 As the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan , presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly .	0	psychology
 3532 . Sleep can be divided into two different general phases : REM sleep and non - REM ( NREM ) sleep .	1	psychology
 Rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids .	1	psychology
 Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .	0	psychology
 3535 . In terms of brain wave activity , stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves .	0	psychology
 The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves , which are relatively low frequency ( 8–13Hz ) , high amplitude patterns of electrical activity ( waves ) that become synchronized ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed , yet awake .	0	psychology
 3538 . Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 A sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory ( Fogel & Smith , 2011 ; Poe , Walsh , & Bjorness , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .	0	psychology
 3541 . The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time .	0	psychology
 By the late 19th century , German psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious .	0	psychology
 By analyzing dreams , Freud thought people could increase self - awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives .	0	psychology
 3544 . The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious .	0	psychology
 The collective unconscious , as described by Jung , is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone .	1	psychology
 According to Jung , certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location .	0	psychology
 3547 . A parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted , disruptive motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role .	1	psychology
 Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep .	0	psychology
 3550 . A person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or when trying to fall asleep .	1	psychology
 This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs , which , not surprisingly , contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep .	0	psychology
 3553 . There are two types of sleep apnea : obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea .	0	psychology
 Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .	1	psychology
 In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .	1	psychology
 3556 . SIDSIn sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies .	1	psychology
 Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS , and boys have a greater risk than girls .	0	psychology
 3559 . The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) is used by clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders .	1	psychology
 Drug use disorders are addictive disorders , and the criteria for specific substance ( drug ) use disorders are described in DSM-5 .	0	psychology
 3562 . In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .	1	psychology
 Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .	1	psychology
 Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level — even to the point of overdose and death .	0	psychology
 3565 . Stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity .	1	psychology
 Many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system .	0	psychology
 3568 . While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug , high blood levels of caffeine can result in insomnia , agitation , muscle twitching , nausea , irregular heartbeat , and even death ( Reissig , Strain , & Griffiths , 2009 ; Wolt , Ganetsky , & Babu , 2012 ) .	0	psychology
 In 2012 , Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year - old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine .	0	psychology
 3571 . Thus , opioid drugs , which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism , have an extremely high potential for abuse .	0	psychology
 Natural opioids , called opiates , are derivatives of opium , which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant .	1	psychology
 There are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs ( correctly called opioids ) that have very potent painkilling effects , and they are often abused .	1	psychology
 3574 . Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency .	1	psychology
 It is often prescribed for minor pain , and it is available over - the - counter in some other countries .	0	psychology
 3577 . Meditation is the act of focusing on a single target ( such as the breath or a repeated sound ) to increase awareness of the moment .	1	psychology
 While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated , an individual can perform meditation alone .	1	psychology
 3580 . The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold .	0	psychology
 Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50 % of the time .	1	psychology
 Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time .	0	psychology
 3583 . While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment , it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world .	0	psychology
 Perception refers to the way sensory information is organized , interpreted , and consciously experienced .	1	psychology
 Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .	0	psychology
 3586 . In fact , we often do n’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time .	1	psychology
 This is known as sensory adaptation .	0	psychology
 Imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock .	0	psychology
 3589 . The shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception .	0	psychology
 For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .	0	psychology
 One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .	1	psychology
 3592 . The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .	1	psychology
 Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .	1	psychology
 3595 . Like light waves , the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound .	0	psychology
 The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound ’s pitch .	1	psychology
 High - frequency sound waves are perceived as high - pitched sounds , while low - frequency sound waves are perceived as low - pitched sounds .	1	psychology
 3598 . The eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .	1	psychology
 3601 . When light levels are high , the pupil will constrict , or become smaller , to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye .	1	psychology
 The pupil ’s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris , which is the colored portion of the eye .	0	psychology
 3604 . The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .	1	psychology
 The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .	0	psychology
 3607 . Rods and cones are connected ( via several interneurons ) to retinal ganglion cells .	0	psychology
 Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve .	1	psychology
 The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .	1	psychology
 3610 . Normal - sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision .	0	psychology
 Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .	0	psychology
 3616 . Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .	1	psychology
 One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .	1	psychology
 To experience this slightly different view , do this simple exercise : extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger .	0	psychology
 3625 . The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies .	1	psychology
 More specifically , the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies .	0	psychology
 3628 . If a sound comes from an off - center location , it creates two types of binaural cues : interaural level differences and interaural timing differences .	0	psychology
 Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .	1	psychology
 Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3631 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .	1	psychology
 Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .	1	psychology
 Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age , genetic predisposition , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme noise ( noise - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain illnesses ( such as measles or mumps ) , or damage due to toxins ( such as those found in certain solvents and metals ) .	0	psychology
 3634 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .	1	psychology
 One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3637 . In the United States and other places around the world , deaf people have their own language , schools , and customs .	1	psychology
 This is called deaf culture .	0	psychology
 In the United States , deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language ( ASL ) ; ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures .	1	psychology
 3640 . Umami is our fifth taste .	0	psychology
 Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy , and it is associated with a taste for monosodium glutamate ( Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch , 2009 ) .	1	psychology
 There is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food ( Mizushige , Inoue , & Fushiki , 2007 ) .	0	psychology
 3643 . Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor , chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb : a bulb - like structure at the tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin .	1	psychology
 From the olfactory bulb , information is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex , which is located very near the gustatory cortex ( Lodovichi & Belluscio , 2012 ; Spors et al . , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 3646 . Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .	1	psychology
 Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .	0	psychology
 3649 . As a result , pain signals that are sent to the brain get exaggerated .	1	psychology
 This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain .	0	psychology
 Multiple treatment options for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation .	0	psychology
 3658 . The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3661 . In this chapter , you have learned that perception is a complex process .	0	psychology
 Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .	0	psychology
 3667 . Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell ?	0	psychology
 Even if you are new to the study of psychology , chances are that you have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs .	0	psychology
 3670 . In Pavlov ’s experiments , the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them .	0	psychology
 The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .	1	psychology
 The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .	1	psychology
 3679 . When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger ’s food again , Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food — she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound .	0	psychology
 The behavior of Pavlov ’s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery : the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period ( [ link]).This is the curve of acquisition , extinction , and spontaneous recovery .	1	psychology
 The rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus ( acquisition ) .	0	psychology
 3682 . But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound , and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound , she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds ( provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart).Sometimes , classical conditioning can lead to habituation .	0	psychology
 Habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change .	1	psychology
 As the stimulus occurs over and over , we learn not to focus our attention on it .	0	psychology
 3685 . Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited , and it does n’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike .	1	psychology
 He proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about .	0	psychology
 3688 . The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement .	0	psychology
 In positive reinforcement , a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior .	1	psychology
 3691 . In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .	0	psychology
 In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .	1	psychology
 An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class .	0	psychology
 3694 . How about Joaquin , the soccer player ?	0	psychology
 If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary reinforcer .	0	psychology
 Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities .	1	psychology
 3697 . Watch this video clip where veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shapes a dog ’s behavior using the steps outlined above . Once a behavior is trained , researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement .	0	psychology
 In partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement , the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior .	1	psychology
 There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3700 . With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded .	0	psychology
 Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store , and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses .	0	psychology
 3703 . He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 As the unreinforced rats explored the maze , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze .	0	psychology
 3706 . In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a mirror neuron ( Hickock , 2010 ; Rizzolatti , Fadiga , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2002 ; Rizzolatti , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 3709 . If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior , you will be more motivated to copy her .	1	psychology
 This is known as vicarious reinforcement .	0	psychology
 On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .	0	psychology
 3712 . This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .	0	psychology
 Simply put , cognition is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .	1	psychology
 Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3715 . Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .	0	psychology
 A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .	1	psychology
 For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .	0	psychology
 3718 . A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts ( Bartlett , 1932 ) .	1	psychology
 There are many different types of schemata , and they all have one thing in common : schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently .	0	psychology
 3721 . Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another .	1	psychology
 While language is a form of communication , not all communication is language .	0	psychology
 3724 . Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language .	0	psychology
 A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .	1	psychology
 Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .	1	psychology
 3727 . Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3730 . Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules .	0	psychology
 This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization .	0	psychology
 In this context , overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule .	1	psychology
 3733 . Another type of strategy is an algorithm .	0	psychology
 An algorithm is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed .	0	psychology
 3736 . The person is stuck — but she just needs to go to another doorway , instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway .	0	psychology
 A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now .	1	psychology
 3739 . An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .	0	psychology
 3742 . Finally , the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that readily available to you , even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision .	1	psychology
 Biases tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our preexisting knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and hypotheses ” ( Aronson , 1995 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 These biases are summarized in [ link ] .	0	psychology
 3748 . Interestingly , drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage .	1	psychology
 A habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage .	1	psychology
 Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future ( Graham & Weiner , 1996 ) .	0	psychology
 3757 . Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations .	0	psychology
 Sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze , evaluate , judge , compare , and contrast .	1	psychology
 3760 . Gardner ’s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence .	0	psychology
 Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others , show empathy , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways ( Parker , Saklofske , & Stough , 2009 ) .	1	psychology
 People with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills .	0	psychology
 3766 . As blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating ( Drazen & Woods , 2003 ; Druce , Small , & Bloom , 2004 ; Greary , 1990 ) .	0	psychology
 The food ’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain ( Woods , 2004 ) , and fat cells release leptin , a satiety hormone .	1	psychology
 3769 . This observation led some to propose a set - point theory of body weight regulation .	0	psychology
 The set - point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is resistant to change .	1	psychology
 This set - point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure ( Speakman et al . , 2011 ) .	0	psychology
 3772 . People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	0	psychology
 Morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI over 40 .	1	psychology
 Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the CDC , and other groups , its value as an assessment tool has been questioned .	0	psychology
 3775 . People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed .	1	psychology
 Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors .	0	psychology
 3778 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	1	psychology
 Like bulimia nervosa , anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , amenorrhea ( cessation of the menstrual period ) , reduced function of the gonads , and in extreme cases , death .	0	psychology
 3781 . MASTERS AND JOHNSON ’S RESEARCHIn 1966 , William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior .	0	psychology
 Unlike Kinsey , who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data , Masters and Johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions , and they observed people masturbating , manually or with the aid of a device .	0	psychology
 3784 . The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	0	psychology
 Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .	0	psychology
 3787 . While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm .	1	psychology
 In men , the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day .	0	psychology
 3790 . This involves dressing in opposite - sex clothing and assuming an opposite - sex identity .	0	psychology
 These individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 While these may sound like drastic changes , gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature , and they seek to correct this mistake .	0	psychology
 3793 . Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 The resulting data provide norms , or referential scores , by which to interpret future scores .	0	psychology
 3796 . The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100 .	0	psychology
 Standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets .	1	psychology
 The bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3799 . Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup .	1	psychology
 According to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience , especially in childhood .	0	psychology
 3802 . As we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions .	0	psychology
 An emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings .	1	psychology
 The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably , but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things .	0	psychology
 3808 . The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone .	0	psychology
 A polygraph , or lie detector test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions .	1	psychology
 Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers .	0	psychology
 3811 . AmygdalaThe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( Blackford & Pine , 2012 ; Goosens & Maren , 2002 ; Maren , Phan , & Liberzon , 2013 ) .	0	psychology
 The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3817 . Or does being happy make you smile ?	0	psychology
 The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions , meaning that smiling can make you feel happier ( Buck , 1980 ; Soussignan , 2001 ; Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) .	1	psychology
 Recent research explored how Botox , which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion .	1	psychology
 3820 . Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids ( “ humors ” ) of the body : choleric temperament ( yellow bile from the liver ) , melancholic temperament ( black bile from the kidneys ) , sanguine temperament ( red blood from the heart ) , and phlegmatic temperament ( white phlegm from the lungs ) ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Eysenck & Eysenck , 1985 ; Lecci & Magnavita , 2013 ; Noga , 2007 ) .	1	psychology
 Centuries later , the influential Greek physician and philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates ’s theory , suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments .	1	psychology
 For example , the choleric person is passionate , ambitious , and bold ; the melancholic person is reserved , anxious , and unhappy ; the sanguine person is joyful , eager , and optimistic ; and the phlegmatic person is calm , reliable , and thoughtful ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ) .	0	psychology
 3829 . When certain events , feelings , or yearnings cause an individual anxiety , the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety .	0	psychology
 To do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety .	1	psychology
 The ego , usually conscious , resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety .	1	psychology
 3835 . In each psychosexual stage of development , the child ’s pleasure - seeking urges , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone .	0	psychology
 The stages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital ( [ link]).Freud ’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial .	0	psychology
 3838 . Freud ’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage ( 3–6 years ) , corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls .	1	psychology
 The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals .	0	psychology
 3841 . Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 3844 . As an art school dropout with an uncertain future , young Erik Erikson met Freud ’s daughter , Anna Freud , while he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna .	0	psychology
 It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis .	0	psychology
 3847 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) .	1	psychology
 These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as facing death , becoming independent , and striving for mastery .	0	psychology
 3850 . We get information into our brains through a process called encoding , which is the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Once we receive sensory information from the environment , our brains label or code it .	0	psychology
 3856 . Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage .	0	psychology
 Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .	1	psychology
 In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 3865 . ( Note : Sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably .	0	psychology
 ) Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness .	1	psychology
 They are memories formed from behaviors .	0	psychology
 3868 . Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language .	1	psychology
 An example would be the question “ what does argumentative mean ? ” Stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts .	0	psychology
 For example , answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory :	0	psychology
 3871 . Very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only 12 known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( Parker , Cahill & McGaugh 2006 ) .	0	psychology
 And although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence , two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays .	0	psychology
 3874 . For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again .	1	psychology

 In 1965 , the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v.

Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and communications .	1	government

 In 2003 , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Bakke decision in Grutter v.

 Poll taxes required voters to pay a fee to vote .	1	government
 Grandfather clauses exempted individuals from taking literacy tests or paying poll taxes if they or their fathers or grandfathers had been permitted to vote prior to a certain point in time .	1	government
 While the Supreme Court determined that grandfather clauses were unconstitutional in 1915 , states continued to use poll taxes and literacy tests to deter potential voters from registering . Guinn v. United States , 238 U.S. 347 ( 1915 ) .	0	government

 Many states have tried to address this problem with early voting , which opens polling places as much as two weeks early .	0	government
 Texas opened polling places on weekdays and weekends in 1988 and initially saw an increase in voting in gubernatorial and presidential elections , although the impact tapered off over time . Stefan D. Haag , “ Early Voting in Texas : What are the Effects ? ” Austin Community College CPPPS Report , http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/earlyvotingfull/report5.pdf ( November 1 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 Other states with early voting , however , showed a decline in turnout , possibly because there is less social pressure to vote when voting is spread over several days . Rich Morin .	0	government
 6357 . Another factor for potential candidates is whether the seat they are considering is competitive or open .	0	government
 A competitive seat describes a race where a challenger runs against the incumbent — the current office holder .	1	government
 An open seat is one whose incumbent is not running for reelection .	1	government
 6360 . While these laws intended to create transparency in campaign funding , government did not have the power to stop the high levels of money entering elections , and little was done to enforce the laws .	0	government
 In 1971 , Congress again tried to fix the situation by passing the Federal Election Campaign Act ( FECA ) , which outlined how candidates would report all contributions and expenditures related to their campaigns .	1	government
 The FECA also created rules governing the way organizations and companies could contribute to federal campaigns , which allowed for the creation of political action committees . Scott and Mullen , “ Thirty Year Report . ” Finally , a 1974 amendment to the act created the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , which operates independently of government and enforces the elections laws .	1	government
 6363 . Soon after the passage of the McCain – Feingold Act , the FEC ’s enforcement of the law spurred court cases challenging it .	0	government
 The first , McConnell v. Federal Election Commission ( 2003 ) , resulted in the Supreme Court ’s upholding the act ’s restrictions on how candidates and parties could spend campaign contributions .	1	government
 But later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an election.“Court Case Abstracts , ” http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_W.shtml ( November 12 , 2015 ) ; Davis v.

 6369 . Despite the common use of the primary system , at least five states ( Alaska , Hawaii , Idaho , Colorado , and Iowa ) regularly use caucuses for presidential , state , and local - level nominations .	0	government
 A caucus is a meeting of party members in which nominees are selected informally .	1	government
 Caucuses are less expensive than primaries because they rely on voting methods such as dropping marbles in a jar , placing names in a hat , standing under a sign bearing the candidate ’s name , or taking a voice vote .	0	government
 6372 . Add to this that primary and caucus voters are often more extreme in their political beliefs , and it is easy to see why fewer moderates become party nominees .	0	government

 6396 . California was the first state to allow the use of medical marijuana , after the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 .	0	government
 Just a few years later , however , in Gonzales v. Raich ( 2005 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. government had the authority to criminalize the use of marijuana .	1	government
 In 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government would not seek to prosecute patients using marijuana medically , citing limited resources and other priorities .	0	government
 6399 . The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , passed by Congress in 1970 , declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act .	1	government
 And despite Holder ’s statement , a 2013 memo by James Cole , the deputy attorney general , reminded states that marijuana use is still illegal . James M.

 6402 . Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders arrived in Seattle on August 8 , 2015 , to give a speech at a rally to promote his presidential campaign .	0	government
 Instead , the rally was interrupted — and eventually co - opted — by activists for Black Lives Matter ( [ link]).Dan Merica , “ Black Lives Matter Protesters Shut Down Sanders Event in Seattle , ” CNN , 10 August 2015 .	0	government
 Why did the group risk alienating Democratic voters by preventing Sanders from speaking ?	0	government
 Because Black Lives Matter had been trying to raise awareness of the treatment of black citizens in the United States , and the media has the power to elevate such issues.http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/ ( August 29 , 2015 ) .	1	government
 While some questioned its tactics , the organization ’s move underscores how important the media are to gaining recognition , and the lengths to which organizations are willing to go to get media attention .

 2944 . Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century , the main features of the electrostatic force — the existence of two types of charge , the observation that like charges repel , unlike charges attract , and the decrease of force with distance — were eventually refined , and expressed as a mathematical formula .	1	physics

 MRI is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) in which an externally applied magnetic field interacts with the nuclei of certain atoms , particularly those of hydrogen ( protons ) .	1	physics
 These nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields , similar to those of electrons and the current loops discussed earlier in this chapter .

 3121 . The brightest colors are those that interfere constructively .	0	physics
 This interference is between light reflected from different surfaces of a thin film ; thus , the effect is known as thin film interference .	0	physics
 As noticed before , interference effects are most prominent when light interacts with something having a size similar to its wavelength .	0	physics
 3124 . Waves having such a direction are said to be polarized .	0	physics
 For an EM wave , we define the direction of polarization to be the direction parallel to the electric field .	1	physics
 Thus we can think of the electric field arrows as showing the direction of polarization , as in [ link].An EM wave , such as light , is a transverse wave .	0	physics
 3127 . The Sun and many other light sources produce waves that are randomly polarized ( see [ link ] ) .	1	physics
 Such light is said to be unpolarized because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization .	0	physics
 Polaroid materials , invented by the founder of Polaroid Corporation , Edwin Land , act as a polarizing slit for light , allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through .	1	physics
 3130 . Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two .	1	physics
 Such crystals are said to be birefringent ( see [ link ] ) .	0	physics
 Each of the separated rays has a specific polarization .	0	physics
 3133 . An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force .	1	physics
 3136 . It was not until 1905 , when Einstein published his first paper on special relativity , that the currently accepted conclusion was reached .	0	physics
 Based mostly on his analysis that the laws of electricity and magnetism would not allow another speed for light , and only slightly aware of the Michelson - Morley experiment , Einstein detailed his second postulate of special relativity . Second Postulate of Special Relativity	0	physics
 3139 . An observer of electromagnetic radiation sees relativistic Doppler effects if the source of the radiation is moving relative to the observer .	0	physics
 The wavelength of the radiation is longer ( called a red shift ) than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and shorter ( called a blue shift ) when the source moves toward the observer .	0	physics
 3145 . The type of gas and its temperature , for example , could be determined .	0	physics
 We now know that these EM emissions come from electrons transitioning between energy levels in individual atoms and molecules ; thus , they are called atomic spectra .	1	physics
 Atomic spectra remain an important analytical tool today .	0	physics
 3151 . They are akin to lines in atomic spectra , implying the energy levels of atoms are quantized .	0	physics
 Phenomena such as discrete atomic spectra and characteristic x rays are explored further in Atomic Physics . Ultraviolet radiation ( approximately 4 eV to 300 eV ) overlaps with the low end of the energy range of x rays , but UV is typically lower in energy .	0	physics
 UV comes from the de - excitation of atoms that may be part of a hot solid or gas .	1	physics
 3154 . Not all molecules have this property .	0	physics
 Air , for example , is nearly transparent to many IR frequencies . Microwaves are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic circuits , although they are also produced naturally .	1	physics
 Thus microwaves are similar to IR but do not extend to as high frequencies .	0	physics
 3157 . λ = hp(matter and photons),λ = hp(matter and photons ) , size 12{λ = { { h } over { p } } } { } where hh size 12{h } { } is Planck ’s constant and pp size 12{p } { } is momentum .	1	physics
 This is defined to be the de Broglie wavelength .	0	physics
 ( Note that we already have this for photons , from the equation p = h / λp = h / λ size 12{p = h / λ } { } . )	0	physics
 3160 . Particle - wave duality — the fact that all particles have wave properties — is one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics .	1	physics
 We first came across it in the treatment of photons , those particles of EM radiation that exhibit both particle and wave properties , but not at the same time .	1	physics
 3163 . The English scientist William Crookes , among others , continued to study what for some time were called Crookes tubes , wherein electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the rarefied gas inside the tube and are accelerated from the cathode ( negative ) to the anode ( positive ) by the high potential .	1	physics
 These “ cathode rays ” collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them , resulting in the emission of electromagnetic ( EM ) radiation that makes the electrons’ path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode . Gas discharge tubes today are most commonly called cathode - ray tubes , because the rays originate at the cathode .	1	physics
 Crookes showed that the electrons carry momentum ( they can make a small paddle wheel rotate ) .	0	physics
 3166 . Hydrogen spectrum wavelength .	0	physics
 The Balmer series requires that nf=2nf=2 size 12{n rSub { size 8{f } } = 2 } { } .	0	physics
 3169 . So , if a nucleus has ZZ size 12{Z } { } protons ( Z=1Z=1 size 12{Z=1 } { } for hydrogen , 2 for helium , etc . )	0	physics
 and only one electron , that atom is called a hydrogen - like atom .	0	physics
 The spectra of hydrogen - like ions are similar to hydrogen , but shifted to higher energy by the greater attractive force between the electron and nucleus .	0	physics
 3172 . Each type of atom ( or element ) has its own characteristic electromagnetic spectrum .	0	physics
 X rays lie at the high - frequency end of an atom ’s spectrum and are characteristic of the atom as well .	0	physics
 In this section , we explore characteristic x rays and some of their important applications . We have previously discussed x rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum in Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum .	0	physics
 3175 . Once it is excited , the atom can de - excite in several ways , one of which is to re - emit a photon of the same energy as excited it , a single step back to the ground state .	1	physics
 This is called atomic de - excitation .	0	physics
 All other paths of de - excitation involve smaller steps , in which lower - energy ( longer wavelength ) photons are emitted .	0	physics
 3178 . Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms , they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and , thus , are said to be metastable , meaning relatively stable .	0	physics
 Phosphorescence is the de - excitation of a metastable state .	1	physics
 Glow - in - the - dark materials , such as luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children ’s toys and pajamas , are made of phosphorescent substances .	0	physics
 3181 . The name laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation , the process just described .	1	physics
 The process was proposed and developed following the advances in quantum physics .	0	physics
 3184 . In order to explore the substructure of atoms ( and knowing that magnetic fields affect moving charges ) , the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz ( 1853–1930 ) suggested that his student Pieter Zeeman ( 1865–1943 ) study how spectra might be affected by magnetic fields .	0	physics
 What they found became known as the Zeeman effect , which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field , as shown in [ link ] .	1	physics
 For their discoveries , Zeeman and Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics .	0	physics
 3187 . Physical characteristics that are quantized — such as energy , charge , and angular momentum — are of such importance that names and symbols are given to them .	0	physics
 The values of quantized entities are expressed in terms of quantum numbers , and the rules governing them are of the utmost importance in determining what nature is and does .	0	physics
 This section covers some of the more important quantum numbers and rules — all of which apply in chemistry , material science , and far beyond the realm of atomic physics , where they were first discovered .	0	physics
 3190 . The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity .	0	physics
 The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .	0	physics
 A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) .	1	physics
 3193 . Apart from αα size 12{α } { } , ββ size 12{β } { } , and γγ size 12{γ } { } , there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well , and these also produce ionization with similar effects .	0	physics
 We define ionizing radiation as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not , since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization . These dosimeters ( literally , dose meters ) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor .	1	physics
 The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered , a measurement of dose .	0	physics
 3196 . The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce , such as the phosphor used by Rutherford ’s group .	0	physics
 Materials called scintillators use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light .	0	physics
 Scintillators may be liquid or solid , and they can be very efficient .	0	physics
 3199 . We have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei .	1	physics
 However , there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei — the proton and the neutron , referred to collectively as nucleons , the constituents of nuclei .	1	physics
 3202 . Decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability .	0	physics
 There are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons , called magic numbers .	0	physics
 Magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed shells are more stable .	1	physics
 3205 . There are actually three types of beta decay .	0	physics
 The first discovered was “ ordinary ” beta decay and is called β−β− size 12{β rSup { size 8 { - { } } } } { } decay or electron emission .	0	physics
 3208 . Antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons , being nearly identical , having the same mass , spin , and so on , but having a positive charge and an electron family number of –1–1 .	1	physics
 When a positron encounters an electron , there is a mutual annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectron - electron pair is converted into pure photon energy .	0	physics
 ( The reaction , e++e−→γ+γe++e−→γ+γ size 12{e rSup { size 8{+ { } } } + e rSup { size 8{- { } } } rightarrow g+g } { } , conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved quantities . )	0	physics
" 3211 . This reduces it to N/1024N/1024 size 12 { { N } slash { "" 1024 "" } } { } ."	0	physics
 For an arbitrary time , not just a multiple of the half - life , the exponential relationship must be used . Radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity .	0	physics
 Its most famous application is carbon-14 dating .	0	physics
 3214 . We can therefore learn about nuclear forces by examining how tightly bound the nuclei are .	0	physics
 We define the binding energy ( BE ) of a nucleus to be the energy required to completely disassemble it into separate protons and neutrons .	1	physics
 We can determine the BE of a nucleus from its rest mass .	0	physics
 3217 . Second , nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in , so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes .	1	physics
 The compound is said to be tagged .	0	physics
 A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical .	1	physics
 608 . In shotgun sequencing method , several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces ( somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun ) .	1	biology
 All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain - sequencing method .	0	biology
 614 . DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences .	1	biology
 Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays , whereas whole - genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome .	0	biology
 617 . Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics .	0	biology
 Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .	1	biology
 The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .	1	biology
 620 . Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer ; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process .	1	biology
 An individual protein is called a biomarker , whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature .	0	biology
 For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as sweat , blood , or urine , such that large - scale screenings can be performed in a non - invasive fashion .	0	biology
 626 . Darwin called this mechanism natural selection .	0	biology
 Natural selection , also known as “ survival of the fittest , ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change .	1	biology
 629 . Sometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other .	0	biology
 When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point , it is called divergent evolution .	1	biology
 Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ( [ link]).Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor .	0	biology
 632 . Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all , and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor .	1	biology
 These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures .	0	biology
 Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds , leaves on some cacti , and hind leg bones in whales .	0	biology
 638 . For example , even though bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) and African fish eagles ( Haliaeetus vocifer ) are both birds and eagles , each belongs to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch , that offspring , called a hybrid ( a cross between two species ) , would probably be infertile — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity .	1	biology
 Different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions .	0	biology
" 641 . Allopatric speciation ( allo- = "" other "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution ."	1	biology
" Sympatric speciation ( sym- = "" same "" ; -patric = "" homeland "" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location ."	1	biology
 644 . Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed .	1	biology
 In some cases , a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The prefix “ auto- ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species .	1	biology
 647 . Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually .	1	biology
 Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .	1	biology
 A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .	0	biology
 650 . In some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species .	1	biology
 This situation is called habitat isolation .	0	biology
 Reproduction with the parent species ceases , and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent .	0	biology
 653 . Hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages .	1	biology
 This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable .	0	biology
 In another postzygotic situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called hybrid sterility .	1	biology
 662 . Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences , or genetic variance , among individuals in a population .	1	biology
 The greater the hereditability of a population ’s phenotypic variation , the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation .	0	biology
 665 . While it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool .	0	biology
 However , if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other , this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring , a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression .	1	biology
 668 . Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events , such as a natural disaster that kills — at random — a large portion of the population .	0	biology
 Known as the bottleneck effect , it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In one fell swoop , the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - disaster population .	0	biology
 671 . Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection .	0	biology
 One common form of mate choice , called assortative mating , is an individual ’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves .	1	biology
 674 . Natural selection only acts on the population ’s heritable traits : selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution .	1	biology
 Natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms .	0	biology
 677 . If natural selection favors an average phenotype , selecting against extreme variation , the population will undergo stabilizing selection ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 In a population of mice that live in the woods , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators .	0	biology
 680 . Another type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , favors phenotypes that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) .	1	biology
 An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest .	0	biology
 683 . The good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease .	1	biology
 Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority , which they will then pass on to their offspring .	0	biology
 686 . Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms .	0	biology
 A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms .	1	biology
 Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships .	0	biology
 689 . The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .	1	biology
 A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .	1	biology
 When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .	1	biology
 692 . Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these disciplines together contribute to building , updating , and maintaining the “ tree of life . ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics .	0	biology
 Data may be collected from fossils , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by DNA analysis .	0	biology
 695 . Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .	1	biology
 After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 698 . This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions .	0	biology
 When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an analogy or homoplasy .	1	biology
 For example , insects use wings to fly like bats and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different .	0	biology
 704 . To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately , scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony , which means that events occurred in the simplest , most obvious way .	1	biology
 For example , if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking , based on the principle of maximum parsimony , one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones .	0	biology
 710 . The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .	1	biology
 Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .	1	biology
 All of these hypotheses are testable .	0	biology
 713 . Virions , single virus particles , are very small , about 20–250 nanometers in diameter .	0	biology
 These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell .	1	biology
 716 . Viruses come in many shapes and sizes , but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family .	0	biology
 All virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins , called a capsid .	1	biology
 The capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres .	0	biology
 719 . Glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells .	1	biology
 Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions .	1	biology
 Chicken pox , influenza , and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes .	0	biology
 722 . Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .	0	biology
 Group II viruses have single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as their genome .	1	biology
 They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .	0	biology
 725 . Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .	1	biology
 Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .	1	biology
 Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .	1	biology
 728 . Additionally , full - length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative - stranded genome .	0	biology
 Group VI viruses have diploid ( two copies ) ssRNA genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse transcriptase , to dsDNA ; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .	1	biology
 731 . The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage .	1	biology
 These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .	0	biology
 Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .	1	biology
 737 . When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .	1	biology
 If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4 , which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract .	0	biology
 740 . An example is the animal herpesviruses , including herpes simplex viruses , the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans .	0	biology
 In a process called latency , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions , only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates .	1	biology
 Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency , the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages .	0	biology
 743 . Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .	0	biology
 Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .	0	biology
 Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .	1	biology
 746 . Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s sap , by living organisms such as insects and nematodes , and through pollen .	1	biology
 When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .	1	biology
 752 . The danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .	0	biology
 Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .	1	biology
 Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host .	0	biology
 755 . The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them .	0	biology
 Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic - resistant bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries .	0	biology
 However , the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria .	0	biology
 As more and more antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria evolve , the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide .	0	biology
 758 . It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle .	0	biology
 PrP exists in two forms , PrPc , the normal form of the protein , and PrPsc , the infectious form .	0	biology
 Once introduced into the body , the PrPsc contained within the prion binds to PrPc and converts it to PrPsc .	0	biology
 761 . Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth ; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago .	0	biology
 A microbial mat is a multi - layered sheet of prokaryotes ( [ link ] ) that includes mostly bacteria , but also archaea .	1	biology
 Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick , and they typically grow where different types of materials interface , mostly on moist surfaces .	0	biology
 767 . Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs , and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth .	1	biology
 Then , cyanobacteria , also known as blue - green algae , evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later .	0	biology
 Cyanobacteria ( [ link ] ) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere .	1	biology
 770 . In other cases , culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions , even though the same organism could be cultured previously .	0	biology
 Those organisms that can not be cultured but are not dead are in a viable - but - non - culturable ( VBNC ) state .	1	biology
 The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival .	0	biology
 773 . The cell wall functions as a protective layer , and it is responsible for the organism ’s shape .	1	biology
 Some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall .	0	biology
 Other structures are present in some prokaryotic species , but not in others ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 776 . There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan .	0	biology
 S - layer ( surface layer ) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria .	1	biology
 779 . There are four different types of Archaean cell walls .	0	biology
 One type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan , which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain .	1	biology
 The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides , glycoproteins , or pure protein .	0	biology
 788 . Gaseous nitrogen is transformed , or “ fixed ” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation .	1	biology
 Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms . Another source of ammonia is ammonification , the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen - containing organic compounds .	1	biology
 Ammonia released to the atmosphere , however , represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released ; the rest is as N2 and N2O .	0	biology
 791 . Epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population .	1	biology
 An epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time .	1	biology
 A pandemic is a widespread , usually worldwide , epidemic .	1	biology
 794 . One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death ( 1346 to 1361 ) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis .	0	biology
 It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread along the Silk Road , a network of land and sea trade routes , to the Mediterranean region and Europe , carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships .	0	biology
 797 . The word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning “ against ” and bios meaning “ life . ” An antibiotic is a chemical , produced either by microbes or synthetically , that is hostile to the growth of other organisms .	1	biology
 Today ’s news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis .	0	biology
 800 . Outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common .	0	biology
 A foodborne disease ( colloquially called “ food poisoning ” ) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria , viruses , or other parasites that contaminate food .	1	biology
 Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has reported that “ 76 million people get sick , more than 300,000 are hospitalized , and 5,000 Americans die each year from foodborne illness.”The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time .	0	biology

 Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals ( pesticides , fertilizers ) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface .	0	biology
 809 . Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic .	0	biology
 Their cells contain , in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles , another kind of organelle called a plastid .	0	biology
 When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis , their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments , called accessory pigments , which are involved in harvesting energy from light .	1	biology
 812 . Subtypes of heterotrophs , called saprobes , absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes .	1	biology
 Some protists can function as mixotrophs , obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes , depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available .	1	biology
 815 . The human parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa , the kinetoplastids .	0	biology
 The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast , a DNA mass carried within the single , oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells .	1	biology
 This subgroup includes several parasites , collectively called trypanosomes , which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle .	1	biology
 818 . Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane , called the anal pore .	1	biology
 In addition to a vacuole - based digestive system , Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles , which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell .	1	biology
 821 . The protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod , thereby moving the entire cell .	0	biology
 This type of motion , called cytoplasmic streaming , is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen .	1	biology
 824 . For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi .	0	biology
 The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae .	1	biology
 Through mycorrhizae , the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively , lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner ( usually an alga ) .	1	biology
 827 . Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions .	1	biology
 Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts .	1	biology
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) and Candida species ( the agents of thrush , a common fungal infection ) are examples of unicellular fungi ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 830 . Most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa ( singular , septum ) ( [ link]a , c ) .	1	biology
 In most phyla of fungi , tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha .	0	biology
 833 . Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive .	1	biology
 Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .	1	biology
 Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .	0	biology
 836 . The rings swell when they touch the nematode , gripping it in a tight hold .	0	biology
 The fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria .	0	biology
 Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria , as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host , release digestive enzymes within the host 's body , and absorb the digested nutrients .	1	biology
 839 . When both mating types are present in the same mycelium , it is called homothallic , or self - fertile .	1	biology
 Heterothallic mycelia require two different , but compatible , mycelia to reproduce sexually .	1	biology
 842 . The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes .	0	biology
 The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota , or true fungi .	1	biology
 845 . The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota , which is characterized by the formation of an ascus ( plural , asci ) , a sac - like structure that contains haploid ascospores .	1	biology
 Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance .	0	biology
 848 . This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage .	0	biology
 Eventually , the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp , which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground — this is what we think of as a mushroom .	1	biology
 The basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap . Art Connection	0	biology
 851 . The Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about 230 species that all live in close association with the roots of trees .	1	biology
 Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .	0	biology
 854 . Both parasites and pathogens harm the host ; however , the pathogen causes a disease , whereas the parasite usually does not .	0	biology
 Commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other .	1	biology
 857 . Mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans ( and other animals ) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins ( mycotoxins ) .	1	biology
 Mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms .	1	biology
 In addition , individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions .	0	biology
 860 . The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .	0	biology
 In a second type , the Glomeromycete fungi form vesicular – arbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( sometimes called endomycorrhizae ) .	0	biology
 In these mycorrhiza , the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 863 . Most biologists also consider green algae to be plants , although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom .	0	biology
 The reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae , the Charophytes , share common characteristics with land plants ( such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants ) .	0	biology
 These characteristics are absent in other types of algae .	0	biology
 866 . Two different types of spores are produced in land plants , resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle .	0	biology
 Seedless non - vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous .	1	biology
 The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants .	0	biology
 869 . The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .	1	biology
 Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .	0	biology
 872 . In the gametangia , precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis .	0	biology
 The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .	0	biology
 Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .	1	biology
 875 . In a further division , land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue , as detailed in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Plants that lack vascular tissue , which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients , are referred to as non - vascular plants .	1	biology
 Liverworts , mosses , and hornworts are seedless , non - vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution .	0	biology
 878 . Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually , by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae .	0	biology
 In this latter type of reproduction , the gemmae — small , intact , complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus ( shown in [ link])—are splashed out of the cup by raindrops .	0	biology
 The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes .	0	biology
 881 . For example , stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte , and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophyte ’s stalk .	0	biology
 Additionally , mosses are anchored to the substrate — whether it is soil , rock , or roof tiles — by multicellular rhizoids .	0	biology
 These structures are precursors of roots .	0	biology
 884 . A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal .	1	biology
 The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular , close - fitting units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on moisture levels , and periodically release spores .	0	biology
 887 . The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .	1	biology
 Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls , and are thus described as lignified .	1	biology
 Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue .	1	biology
 893 . Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia .	1	biology
 Strobili are cone - like structures that contain sporangia .	1	biology
 They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones .	0	biology
 896 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Whisk Ferns)While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots , the whisk ferns , Class Psilotopsida , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction .	0	biology
 Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia .	0	biology
 902 . Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation .	0	biology
 The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium , and later , the embryo , is called the integument .	1	biology
 905 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .	0	biology
 One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .	0	biology
 5603 . This must be contrasted with the absolute poverty that is frequently found in underdeveloped countries and defined as the inability , or near - inability , to afford basic necessities such as food ( Byrns 2011).We can not even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment in the United States .	1	sociology
 First , unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment , a state in which a person accepts a lower paying , lower status job than their education and experience qualifies them to perform .	1	sociology
 Second , unemployment statistics only count those :	0	sociology
 5606 . We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions .	1	sociology
 For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India . Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) .	1	sociology
 5609 . What if the U.S. economy thrived solely on basic bartering instead of its bustling agricultural and technological goods ?	0	sociology
 Would you still see a busy building like the one shown in [ link]?In sociology , economy refers to the social institution through which a society ’s resources are exchanged and managed .	1	sociology
 The earliest economies were based on trade , which is often a simple exchange in which people traded one item for another .	1	sociology
 5612 . At first , most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social groups ( Mauss 1922 ) .	0	sociology
 Exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering .	1	sociology
 This system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same time .	0	sociology
 5615 . The Industrial Revolution also changed agricultural practices .	0	sociology
 Until that time , many people practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their taxes .	1	sociology
 New technology introduced gasoline - powered farm tools such as tractors , seed drills , threshers , and combine harvesters .	0	sociology
 5618 . Because of challenges in their economies , several of these communist countries have moved from central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions .	0	sociology
 Market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism , like allowing limited private ownership or consulting market demands .	1	sociology
 This could involve situations like profits generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds ( Gregory and Stuart 2003 ) .	0	sociology
 5621 . Markets produce goods as they are supposed to , but eventually the market is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands .	0	sociology
 Typically the market goes through phases of surplus , or excess , inflation , where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday , and recession , which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline .	1	sociology
 The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .	0	sociology
 5624 . Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing .	0	sociology
 Social stratification refers to a society ’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth , income , race , education , and power .	1	sociology
 5633 . This was generally a closed system , with people born into positions of nobility .	0	sociology
 Wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture , a law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son .	1	sociology
 If the family had no son , the land went to the next closest male relation .	0	sociology
 5636 . Individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons .	0	sociology
 Upward mobility refers to an increase — or upward shift — in social class .	1	sociology
 In the United States , people applaud the rags - to - riches achievements of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Michael Jordan .	0	sociology
 5642 . Global stratification compares the wealth , economic stability , status , and power of countries across the world .	1	sociology
 Global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality . In the early years of civilization , hunter - gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth and rarely interacted with other societies .	0	sociology
 5645 . Just as the United States ' wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class slowly disappears , global inequality is concentrating resources in certain nations and is significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries .	1	sociology
 In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .	0	sociology
 5648 . Familiar and still used by many , it classifies countries into first world , second world , and third world nations based on their respective economic development and standards of living .	0	sociology
 When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .	1	sociology
 The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .	1	sociology
 5651 . The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .	1	sociology
 Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .	1	sociology
 Also during the Cold War , global inequality was described in terms of economic development .	0	sociology
 5654 . We can be sure the workers in a Cuban cigar factory , for example , which are owned or leased by global core nation companies , are not enjoying the same privileges and rights as U.S. workers .	0	sociology
 Semi - peripheral nations are in - between nations , not powerful enough to dictate policy but nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle - class marketplace for core nations , while also exploiting peripheral nations .	1	sociology
 Mexico is an example , providing abundant cheap agricultural labor to the U.S. , and supplying goods to the United States market at a rate dictated by the U.S. without the constitutional protections offered to United States workers .	0	sociology
 5657 . Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .	1	sociology
 Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .	1	sociology
 As expected , global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost , including the building of infrastructure , training of workers , shipping of goods , and , of course , paying employee wages .	0	sociology
 5660 . People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .	0	sociology
 But it is true that you might feel ” poor ” if you are living without a car to drive to and from work , without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill , and without any “ extras ” beyond just making ends meet . Contrary to relative poverty , people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities , which typically include adequate food , clean water , safe housing , and access to healthcare .	1	sociology
 Absolute poverty is defined by the World Bank ( 2014a ) as when someone lives on less than $ 1.25 a day .	1	sociology
 5666 . Dependency TheoryDependency theory was created in part as a response to the Western - centric mindset of modernization theory .	0	sociology
 It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations ( or high - income nations ) exploiting semi - peripheral and peripheral nations ( or middle - income and low - income nations ) , which creates a cycle of dependence ( Hendricks 2010 ) .	1	sociology
 5669 . Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture — the practices , values , and beliefs of a group . This culture might include shared language , religion , and traditions , among other commonalities .	1	sociology
 5672 . Let us explore the differences between these concepts .	0	sociology
 Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people .	1	sociology
 Stereotypes can be based on race , ethnicity , age , gender , sexual orientation — almost any characteristic .	0	sociology
 5675 . The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .	1	sociology
 Institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of society .	1	sociology
 For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .	0	sociology
 5678 . For example , when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime , it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority .	0	sociology
 Another example of racist practices is racial steering , in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race .	1	sociology
 Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices .	0	sociology
 5681 . Ferguson ’s racial imbalance may explain in part why , even though in 2010 only about 63 percent of its population was black , in 2013 blacks were detained in 86 percent of stops , 92 percent of searches , and 93 percent of arrests ( Missouri Attorney General ’s Office 2014 ) .	0	sociology
 In addition , de facto segregation in Ferguson ’s schools , a race - based wealth gap , urban sprawl , and a black unemployment rate three times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities ( Bouie 2014).Multiple IdentitiesGolfer Tiger Woods has Chinese , Thai , African American , Native American , and Dutch heritage .	0	sociology
 Individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common .	0	sociology
 5684 . Genocide , the deliberate annihilation of a targeted ( usually subordinate ) group , is the most toxic intergroup relationship .	1	sociology
 Historically , we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group , intentional or not .	0	sociology
 5687 . Pluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a “ salad bowl ” : a great mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole .	0	sociology
 True pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures , both dominant and subordinate , creating a multicultural environment of acceptance .	1	sociology
 5690 . Asian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice , despite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority .	0	sociology
 The model minority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational , professional , and socioeconomic levels without challenging the existing establishment .	1	sociology
 5696 . Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ , which stands for “ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender ” ( and “ Queer ” or “ Questioning ” when the Q is added).Sociologically , it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage .	1	sociology
 In 1996 , The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) was passed , explicitly limiting the definition of “ marriage ” to a union between one man and one woman .	1	sociology
 It also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same - sex marriages performed in other states .	0	sociology
 5699 . Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .	1	sociology
 Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .	1	sociology
 Transgender is not the same as homosexual , and many homosexual males view both their sex and gender as male .	0	sociology
 5702 . Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism .	0	sociology
 Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another .	1	sociology
 It varies in its level of severity .	0	sociology
 5705 . The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .	1	sociology
 This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .	0	sociology
 5708 . Madame Jeanne Calment of France was the world 's oldest living person until she died at 122 years old ; there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as 115 years or older ( Diebel 2014).Supercentenarians are people living to 110 years or more .	1	sociology
 In August 2014 , there were seventy - five verified supercentenarians worldwide — seventy - three women and two men .	0	sociology
 5711 . Social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social ( and sociological ) aspects of aging .	1	sociology
 Researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific ages , such as mental and physical wellbeing , plus age - specific concerns such as the process of dying .	0	sociology
 5714 . Baby BoomersOf particular interest to gerontologists today is the population of baby boomers , the cohort born between 1946 and 1964 and now reaching their 60s .	1	sociology
 Coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s , the baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and therefore their own marketing power ( Macunovich 2000 ) .	0	sociology
 5717 . It is helpful to understand aging in the context of these phases .	0	sociology
 A life course is the period from birth to death , including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation .	1	sociology
 Each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations , which of course vary by individual and culture .	0	sociology
 5720 . For many teenagers and young adults , losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first loss of a loved one they experience .	0	sociology
 It may be their first encounter with grief , a psychological , emotional , and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event .	1	sociology
 5723 . The changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society ’s changing view of death .	0	sociology
 Hospice is a type of healthcare that treats terminally ill people when “ cure - oriented treatments ” are no longer an option ( Hospice Foundation of America 2012b ) .	1	sociology
 5726 . In early societies , the elderly were respected and revered .	0	sociology
 Many preindustrial societies observed gerontocracy , a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society ’s oldest members .	1	sociology
 In some countries today , the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected .	0	sociology
 5729 . The social withdrawal that Cummings and Henry recognized ( 1961 ) , and its notion that elderly people need to find replacement roles for those they ’ve lost , is addressed anew in activity theory .	0	sociology
 According to this theory , activity levels and social involvement are key to this process , and key to happiness ( Havinghurst 1961 ; Neugarten 1964 ; Havinghurst , Neugarten , and Tobin 1968 ) .	1	sociology
 5732 . Another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory ( Riley , Johnson , and Foner 1972 ) .	0	sociology
 Though it may seem obvious now , with our awareness of ageism , age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age , just as they are stratified by race , class , and gender .	0	sociology
 5735 . Another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with compensation theory .	0	sociology
 Baltes and Baltes ( 1990 ) based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection , optimization , and compensation .	1	sociology
 5738 . Sociologists , on the other hand , tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict configuration of status roles .	0	sociology
 Here , we ’ll define family as a socially recognized group ( usually joined by blood , marriage , cohabitation , or adoption ) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society .	1	sociology
 Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .	0	sociology
 5741 . Marriage PatternsWith single parenting and cohabitation ( when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage ) becoming more acceptable in recent years , people may be less motivated to get married .	1	sociology
 In a recent survey , 39 percent of respondents answered “ yes ” when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete ( Pew Research Center 2010 ) .	0	sociology
 5744 . Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .	0	sociology
 Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .	1	sociology
 The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .	1	sociology
 5747 . Both paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one ’s family .	1	sociology
 This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .	0	sociology
 Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .	1	sociology
 5750 . There are three types of unilateral descent : patrilineal , which follows the father ’s line only ; matrilineal , which follows the mother ’s side only ; and ambilineal , which follows either the father ’s only or the mother ’s side only , depending on the situation .	1	sociology
 In partrilineal societies , such as those in rural China and India , only males carry on the family surname .	0	sociology
 5753 . Today , however , these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms .	0	sociology
 While reviewing some of these once - popular theories , it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses . The set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle .	1	sociology
 One of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by Paul Glick in 1955 .	0	sociology
 5756 . Of these children , 54 percent live with grandparents , 21 percent live with other relatives , and 24 percent live with nonrelatives .	0	sociology
 This family structure is referred to as the extended family , and may include aunts , uncles , and cousins living in the same home .	0	sociology
 Foster parents account for about a quarter of nonrelatives .	0	sociology
 5759 . Some people associate religion with places of worship ( a synagogue or church ) , others with a practice ( confession or meditation ) , and still others with a concept that guides their daily lives ( like dharma or sin ) .	0	sociology
 All these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs , values , and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant . Does religion bring fear , wonder , relief , explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice ?	1	sociology
 How do our religious perspectives affect our behavior ?	0	sociology
 5762 . Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .	0	sociology
 Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group , such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins ( Barkan and Greenwood 2003).The History of Religion as a Sociological ConceptIn the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization , three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society : Émile Durkheim , Max Weber , and Karl Marx .	1	sociology
 They are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology .	0	sociology
 5765 . Some sects do not grow into denominations .	1	sociology
 Sociologists call these established sects .	0	sociology
 Established sects , such as the Amish or Jehovah ’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia – cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect - like and denomination - like characteristics .	0	sociology
 5768 . Note that some religions may be practiced — or understood — in various categories .	0	sociology
 For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .	0	sociology
 Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .	0	sociology
 5771 . Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .	1	sociology
 It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .	1	sociology
 While typically not an organized group , atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population .	0	sociology
 5774 . Education is a social institution through which a society ’s children are taught basic academic knowledge , learning skills , and cultural norms .	1	sociology
 Every nation in the world is equipped with some form of education system , though those systems vary greatly .	0	sociology
 5777 . Cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values , beliefs , and social norms of their culture .	1	sociology
 Both informal and formal education include cultural transmission .	0	sociology
 5780 . Another role of schools , according to functionalist theory , is that of sorting , or classifying students based on academic merit or potential .	0	sociology
 The most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements .	0	sociology
 5783 . This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .	0	sociology
 Conflict theorists point to tracking , a formalized sorting system that places students on “ tracks ” ( advanced versus low achievers ) that perpetuate inequalities .	1	sociology
 While educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers , conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self - fulfilling prophecies in which students live up ( or down ) to teacher and societal expectations ( Education Week 2004 ) .	0	sociology
 5786 . The findings in the Coleman Report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the United States .	0	sociology
 The federal Head Start program , which is still active and successful today , was developed to give low - income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in Coleman ’s findings .	0	sociology
 The program provides academic - centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status .	1	sociology
 5789 . Government leaders might have this kind of influence as well , but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government .	0	sociology
 As this example indicates , there is more than one type of authority in a community . Authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow .	1	sociology
 People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect .	0	sociology
 5792 . Followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader ’s personal qualities .	0	sociology
 The appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary , and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution .	0	sociology
 5795 . The power held by these positions varies from one country to another .	0	sociology
 Strictly speaking , a monarchy is a government in which a single person ( a monarch ) rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne .	1	sociology
 Usually , a monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of some sort of divine appointment or calling .	0	sociology
 5798 . The power in an oligarchy is held by a small , elite group .	1	sociology
 Unlike in a monarchy , members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry .	0	sociology
 5801 . A democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice , or vote , in determining state policy , regardless of their level of socioeconomic status .	1	sociology
 Another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike .	0	sociology
 909 . The single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the Gingko biloba ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Its fan - shaped leaves — unique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern — turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree .	1	biology
 912 . For example , the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical .	0	biology
 Petals , collectively the corolla , are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators .	1	biology
 Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .	0	biology
 915 . Flower structure is very diverse , and carpels may be singular , multiple , or fused .	0	biology
 Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil .	1	biology
 The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel .	0	biology
 918 . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .	1	biology
 Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .	0	biology
 924 . Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem ; in monocots , vascular tissue is scattered in the stem .	0	biology
 Eudicots can be herbaceous ( like grasses ) , or produce woody tissues .	0	biology
 Most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate , with three furrows or pores .	1	biology
 927 . It is possible , for example , to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower ’s characteristics .	0	biology
 Many bird or insect - pollinated flowers secrete nectar , which is a sugary liquid .	1	biology
 They also produce both fertile pollen , for reproduction , and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects .	0	biology
 930 . Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .	0	biology
 Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .	1	biology
 936 . Male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube : an extension of a cell within the pollen grain .	1	biology
 The sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella , but in cycads and the Gingko , the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete ; however , they are enclosed in a pollen grain .	0	biology
 939 . Most animals reproduce sexually , and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan .	0	biology
 The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal , determined by developmental cues . All animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food .	1	biology
 The ( a ) black bear is an omnivore , eating both plants and animals .	0	biology
 942 . Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .	1	biology
 This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the gastrula , in which the future digestive cavity is formed .	1	biology
 Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .	0	biology
 945 . These genes that determine animal structure are called “ homeotic genes , ” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes .	1	biology
 The animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as Hox genes .	1	biology
 This family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan , such as the number of body segments of an animal , the number and placement of appendages , and animal head - tail directionality .	0	biology
 948 . The animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers , an inner layer ( endoderm ) and an outer layer ( ectoderm ) .	1	biology
 These animals are called diploblasts .	0	biology
 Diploblasts have a non - living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm .	0	biology
 954 . Bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development .	0	biology
 Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .	0	biology
 957 . Recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes , however , and the theory remains under debate . Another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation , beginning from the gastrula stage .	0	biology
 The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom .	1	biology
 Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely .	0	biology
 960 . This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .	0	biology
 Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage , where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis , resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles .	0	biology
 966 . The time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran period ( from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago ) , the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 It is believed that early animal life , termed Ediacaran biota , evolved from protists at this time .	1	biology
 969 . On the other hand , cataclysmic events , such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life , can result in devastating losses of diversity .	0	biology
 Such periods of mass extinction ( [ link ] ) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life , erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind .	0	biology
 The end of the Permian period ( and the Paleozoic Era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth ’s history , a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time .	0	biology
 972 . Morphology of SpongesThe morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity , the spongocoel , occupying the inside of the cylinder .	1	biology
 Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .	0	biology
 978 . The second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes ( or archaeocytes ) , named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba - like fashion .	1	biology
 Amoebocytes have a variety of functions : delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge , giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction ( which remain in the mesohyl ) , delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs , and differentiating into more - specific cell types .	0	biology
 981 . Phylum Cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic , that is , they develop from two embryonic layers . Nearly all ( about 99 percent ) cnidarians are marine species .	1	biology
 984 . Click here to follow the life cycle of the Obelia . All cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo .	1	biology
 The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .	0	biology
 Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .	0	biology
 987 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .	0	biology
 The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .	1	biology
 Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment , and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity .	0	biology
 990 . This is called protostomy or “ first mouth . ” In protostomy , solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells .	1	biology
 This layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom ; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom .	1	biology
 993 . The Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms .	1	biology
 Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine , predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers , with an estimated 900 species known .	0	biology
 However , nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well .	0	biology
 996 . The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .	0	biology
 In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .	0	biology
 This larval form , characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap , devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult - like morphology .	1	biology
 999 . Additionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .	1	biology
 The mantle ( also known as the pallium ) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks ; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell .	1	biology
 1005 . Phylum Annelida includes segmented worms .	0	biology
 These animals are found in marine , terrestrial , and freshwater habitats , but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival , especially in terrestrial habitats .	0	biology
 1008 . Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the epidermis .	0	biology
 Chitinous hairlike extensions , anchored in the epidermis and projecting from the cuticle , called setae / chaetae are present in every segment .	1	biology
 Annelids show the presence of a true coelom , derived from embryonic mesoderm and protostomy .	0	biology
 1011 . The name “ arthropoda ” means “ jointed legs ” ( in the Greek , “ arthros ” means “ joint ” and “ podos ” means “ leg ” ) ; it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum .	1	biology
 Arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented .	0	biology
 The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages .	0	biology
 1014 . Unlike that of the Hexapoda , the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax ( [ link ] ) , which is covered by a plate called the carapace , thus producing a body structure of two tagma .	0	biology
 Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size .	0	biology
 1017 . Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .	0	biology
 A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1020 . The second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps .	1	biology
 In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .	1	biology
 1023 . Phylum EchinodermataEchinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin ( from the Greek “ echinos ” meaning “ spiny ” and “ dermos ” meaning “ skin ” ) , and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species .	1	biology
 Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms .	0	biology
 Sea stars ( [ link ] ) , sea cucumbers , sea urchins , sand dollars , and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms .	0	biology
 1026 . Phylum ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail .	0	biology
 In some groups , some of these traits are present only during embryonic development .	0	biology
 1029 . The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development .	0	biology
 In chordates , it is located dorsal to the notochord .	0	biology
 1032 . The post - anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body , extending beyond the anus .	1	biology
 The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles , which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species , such as fishes .	0	biology
 1035 . Extant members of Cephalochordata are the lancelets , named for their blade - like shape .	1	biology
 Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas .	0	biology
 1038 . Vertebrates are members of the clade Vertebrata .	0	biology
 Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .	0	biology
 1041 . The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .	0	biology
 Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1044 . The clade Petromyzontidae includes approximately 35–40 or more species of lampreys .	0	biology
 Lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape ; however , lampreys possess some vertebral elements .	1	biology
 Lampreys lack paired appendages and bone , as do the hagfishes .	0	biology
 1047 . Sharks have well - developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey , including a keen sense of smell and electroreception , with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal .	0	biology
 Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things , including their prey .	1	biology
 Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .	0	biology
 1050 . Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective , muscular flap called the operculum .	0	biology
 Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .	1	biology
 Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .	1	biology
 1059 . An estimated 185 species comprise caecilians , a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda .	1	biology
 Although they are vertebrates , a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance .	0	biology
 1062 . The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration .	0	biology
 The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration .	0	biology
 In mammals , membranes that are homologous to the extra - embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta .	0	biology
 1065 . The key differences between the synapsids , anapsids , and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .	1	biology
 Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .	0	biology
 1077 . Mammalian integument , or skin , includes secretory glands with various functions .	1	biology
 Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication .	1	biology
 Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .	0	biology
 1080 . Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks .	1	biology
 Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns .	0	biology
 While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands , male marsupials do not .	0	biology
 1083 . Most mammals have heterodont teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth .	1	biology
 Most mammals are diphyodonts , meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime : deciduous or “ baby ” teeth , and permanent teeth .	1	biology
 Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts , that is , their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life .	1	biology
 1086 . Marsupials are found primarily in Australia , though the opossum is found in North America .	0	biology
 Australian marsupials include the kangaroo , koala , bandicoot , Tasmanian devil ( [ link ] ) , and several other species .	0	biology
 1089 . The feathers on a wing are flexible , so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them , reducing the drag on the wing .	1	biology
 Flight feathers are asymmetrical , which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .	0	biology
 1092 . Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .	1	biology
 Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .	1	biology
 They create a smooth , aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird ’s body , allowing for efficient flight .	0	biology
 1095 . Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long - necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus .	0	biology
 The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .	1	biology
 This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1098 . After the extinction of Enantiornithes , modern birds became the dominant bird , with a large radiation occurring during the Cenozoic Era .	0	biology
 Referred to as Neornithes ( “ new birds ” ) , modern birds are now classified into two groups , the Paleognathae ( “ old jaw ” ) or ratites , a group of flightless birds including ostriches , emus , rheas , and kiwis , and the Neognathae ( “ new jaw ” ) , which includes all other birds .	1	biology
 1104 . These proto - primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available .	0	biology
 The oldest known primate - like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is Plesiadapis ( although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a proto - primate ) .	1	biology
 Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago .	0	biology
 1116 . Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types : meristematic tissue , and permanent ( or non - meristematic ) tissue .	0	biology
 Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .	1	biology
 Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	0	biology
 1119 . Meristematic tissues consist of three types , based on their location in the plant .	0	biology
 Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .	1	biology
 Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 1122 . They differentiate into three main types : dermal , vascular , and ground tissue .	0	biology
 Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .	1	biology
 Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .	1	biology
 1125 . Plant stems , whether above or below ground , are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .	1	biology
 The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .	1	biology
 1128 . An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .	1	biology
 The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .	0	biology
 1131 . Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant , but unlike collenchyma cells , many of them are dead at maturity .	1	biology
 There are two types of sclerenchyma cells : fibers and sclereids .	0	biology
 1137 . The latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity .	0	biology
 Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified .	1	biology
 Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .	0	biology
 1140 . Although still alive at maturity , the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve - tube cells have disintegrated .	0	biology
 Companion cells are found alongside the sieve - tube cells , providing them with metabolic support .	1	biology
 The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve - tube cells , which lack some cellular organelles .	0	biology
 1146 . Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes .	1	biology
 Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .	0	biology
 1149 . Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .	1	biology
 Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp .	1	biology
 ) .	0	biology
 1152 . Some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .	1	biology
 Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .	1	biology
 1155 . Dicots have a tap root system , while monocots have a fibrous root system .	0	biology
 A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically , and from which many smaller lateral roots arise .	1	biology
 Dandelions are a good example ; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds , and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root ) .	0	biology
 1158 . The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption .	0	biology
 Root hairs , which are extensions of root epidermal cells , increase the surface area of the root , greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals .	1	biology
 1161 . A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells .	0	biology
 This waxy region , known as the Casparian strip , forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells .	1	biology
 This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .	0	biology
 1164 . Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .	1	biology
 Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 1167 . Within each leaf , the vascular tissue forms veins .	0	biology
 The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern .	1	biology
 Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1170 . Leaves may be simple or compound ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .	1	biology
 In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .	1	biology
 1173 . ( common name “ umbrella plant ” ) .	0	biology
 Pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather - like appearance ; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib , as in rose leaves ( Rosa sp .	0	biology
 ) , or the leaves of hickory , pecan , ash , or walnut trees .	0	biology
 1176 . In practical terms , therefore , water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water ( at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature ) .	1	biology
 Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter ψ ( psi ) and is expressed in units of pressure ( pressure is a form of energy ) called megapascals ( MPa ) .	0	biology
 The potential of pure water ( Ψwpure H2O ) is , by convenience of definition , designated a value of zero ( even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy , that energy is ignored ) .	0	biology
 1179 . Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water .	0	biology
 Regulation of transpiration , therefore , is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface .	0	biology
 1188 . The aptly - named phototropins are protein - based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response .	1	biology
 Like all plant photoreceptors , phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light - absorbing portion , called the chromophore .	0	biology
 1191 . Amyloplasts ( also known as statoliths ) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity .	1	biology
 Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap .	0	biology
 1194 . The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth .	0	biology
 The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin , a hormone that promotes cytokinesis ( cell division ) .	1	biology
 Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date .	0	biology
 1197 . Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening , flower wilting , and leaf fall .	0	biology
 Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas ( C2H4 ) .	0	biology
 1200 . They act locally at the site of injury , and can also be transported to other tissues .	0	biology
 Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins .	1	biology
 Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae , a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi .	1	biology
 1203 . Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect .	0	biology
 The released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves , which reopen for the next meal . Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress .	1	biology
 When trees bend in the wind , for example , growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens .	0	biology
 1206 . Plants require only light , water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs : these 20 elements are called essential nutrients ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 For an element to be regarded as essential , three criteria are required : 1 ) a plant can not complete its life cycle without the element ; 2 ) no other element can perform the function of the element ; and 3 ) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition .	0	biology
 6717 . In the 1910s , Edith Bolling Wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband , President Woodrow Wilson , afflicted by a stroke , in the last years of his presidency .	0	government
 However , as the niece of one president and the wife of another , it was Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more .	0	government
 6726 . While running for the presidency for the first time in 1992 , Bill Clinton frequently touted the experience and capabilities of his wife .	0	government
 There was a lot to brag about .	0	government
 6729 . The president also exercises the power of pardon without conditions .	0	government
 Once used fairly sparingly — apart from Andrew Johnson ’s wholesale pardons of former Confederates during the Reconstruction period — the pardon power has become more visible in recent decades .	0	government
 6732 . These fears mingled with existing anti - Japanese sentiment across the country and created a paranoia that washed over the West Coast like a large wave .	0	government
 In an attempt to calm fears and prevent any real fifth - column actions , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 , which authorized the removal of people from military areas as necessary .	1	government
 When the military dubbed the entire West Coast a military area , it effectively allowed for the removal of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans from their homes .	0	government

 Signing statements are less powerful than vetoes , though congressional opponents have complained that they derail legislative intent .	0	government
 6744 . The Constitution also limits the Supreme Court ’s original jurisdiction to those rare cases of disputes between states , or between the United States and foreign ambassadors or ministers .	0	government
 So , for the most part , the Supreme Court is an appeals court , operating under appellate jurisdiction and hearing appeals from the lower courts .	1	government
 The rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of Congress .	0	government
 6750 . In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit . Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 U.S. 419 ( 1793 ) .	1	government
 However , their decision was almost immediately overturned by the Eleventh Amendment , passed by Congress in 1794 and ratified by the states in 1795 .	0	government
 In protecting the states , the Eleventh Amendment put a prohibition on the courts by stating , “ The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State , or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State . ” It was an early hint that Congress had the power to change the jurisdiction of the courts as it saw fit and stood ready to use it . In an atmosphere of perceived weakness , the first chief justice , John Jay , an author of The Federalist Papers and appointed by President George Washington , resigned his post to become governor of New York and later declined President John Adams ’s offer of a subsequent term .

 6753 . If the courts find an action to be unconstitutional , it becomes null and void .	0	government
 Judicial review was established in the Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison , when , for the first time , the Court declared an act of Congress to be unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) . Wielding this power is a role Marshall defined as the “ very essence of judicial duty , ” and it continues today as one of the most significant aspects of judicial power .	1	government
 Judicial review lies at the core of the court ’s ability to check the other branches of government — and the states .	0	government
 6756 . President Adams had appointed William Marbury to a position in Washington , DC , but his commission was not delivered before Adams left office .	0	government
 So Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to use its power under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president ’s secretary of state , James Madison , to deliver the commission documents .	0	government
 It was a task Madison refused to do .	0	government
 6762 . The federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights .	0	government
 For example , when Samantha Elauf , a Muslim woman , was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company ’s dress code , the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated , making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages .	0	government
 6768 . In a number of cases , they have expressed reluctance to expand rights without limit , and they still balance that expansion with the government ’s need to govern , provide for the common good , and serve a broader societal purpose .	0	government
 For example , the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty , ruling that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider “ retribution and the possibility of deterrence ” when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it . Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153 ( 1976 ) .	1	government
 In other words , there is a greater good — more safety and security — that may be more important than sparing the life of an individual who has committed a heinous crime .	0	government
 6771 . Courts hear two different types of disputes : criminal and civil .	0	government
 Under criminal law , governments establish rules and punishments ; laws define conduct that is prohibited because it can harm others and impose punishment for committing such an act .	0	government
 Crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness ; felonies are the more serious crimes .	1	government
 6774 . The federal courts , on the other hand , will hear any case that involves a foreign government , patent or copyright infringement , Native American rights , maritime law , bankruptcy , or a controversy between two or more states .	1	government
 Cases arising from activities across state lines ( interstate commerce ) are also subject to federal court jurisdiction , as are cases in which the United States is a party .	0	government
 6780 . There are ninety - four U.S. district courts in the fifty states and U.S. territories , of which eighty - nine are in the states ( at least one in each state ) .	0	government
 The others are in Washington , DC ; Puerto Rico ; Guam ; the U.S. Virgin Islands ; and the Northern Mariana Islands .	0	government
 6783 . Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .	0	government
 Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .	1	government
 Beginning in 1789 when there were just thirteen , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system .	0	government
 6786 . The U.S. court system operates on the principle of stare decisis ( Latin for stand by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and tomorrow ’s rulings rely on what is decided today .	1	government
 Stare decisis is especially important in the U.S. common law system , in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself .	0	government
 6789 . At the federal level , the president nominates a candidate to a judgeship or justice position , and the nominee must be confirmed by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate , a function of the Senate ’s “ advice and consent ” role .	0	government
 All judges and justices in the national courts serve lifetime terms of office .	0	government
 6795 . Since their appointments , both justices have made rulings consistent with a more liberal ideology .	0	government
 The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 has prompted the most recent discussion of appointing a new justice , with Obama nominating Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat .	0	government
 However , action on this nominee is unlikely given the election of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency .	0	government
 6798 . Sandra Day O’Connor , nominated by Republican president Ronald Reagan , often became a champion for women ’s rights .	0	government
 David Souter , nominated by Republican George H. W. Bush , more often than not sided with the Court ’s liberal wing .	0	government
 And even on the present - day court , Anthony Kennedy , a Reagan appointee , has become notorious as the Court ’s swing vote , sometimes siding with the more conservative justices but sometimes not .	0	government
 6801 . For better or worse , sometimes it is only a controversial nominee who leaves a president ’s legacy behind .	0	government
 For example , the Reagan presidency is often remembered for two controversial nominees to the Supreme Court — Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg , the former accused of taking an overly conservative and “ extremist view of the Constitution”John M. Broder .	0	government

 6807 . The Supreme Court of the United States , sometimes abbreviated SCOTUS , is a one - of - a - kind institution .	1	government
 While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves , they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators , lawyers , and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system .	0	government
 6810 . With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .	0	government
 Had the Democrats retained the presidency in 2016 , the replacement for Scalia ’s spot on the court could have swung many key votes in a moderate or liberal direction .	0	government
 6813 . The Supreme Court begins its annual session on the first Monday in October and ends late the following June .	0	government
 Every year , there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the Supreme Court , but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the docket , which is the list of cases scheduled on the Court ’s calendar .	0	government
 The Court typically accepts fewer than 2 percent of the as many as ten thousand cases it is asked to review every year.“Supreme Court Procedures . ” United States Courts .	0	government

 Most of the cases the solicitor general brings to the Court will be given a place on the docket .	0	government
 6828 . If not , then the most senior justice ruling with the majority chooses the writer .	0	government
 Likewise , the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion ; however , any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion .	1	government
 If a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority ’s reasoning in it , that justice may write a concurring opinion .	1	government
 6834 . By 2002 , thirty - six states had repealed their sodomy laws , and most states were only selectively enforcing them .	0	government
 Changes in state laws , along with an emerging LGBT movement , no doubt swayed the Court and led it to the reversal of its earlier ruling with the 2003 decision , Lawrence v. Texas ( [ link]).Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558 ( 2003 ) .	0	government
 6837 . But the most significant check on the Supreme Court is executive and legislative leverage over the implementation and enforcement of its rulings .	1	government
 This process is called judicial implementation .	0	government
 While it is true that courts play a major role in policymaking , they have no mechanism to make their rulings a reality .	0	government

 6846 . The Constitution allocated more power to the federal government by effectively adding two new branches : a president to head the executive branch and the Supreme Court to head the judicial branch .	0	government
 The specific delegated or expressed powers granted to Congress and to the president were clearly spelled out in the body of the Constitution under Article I , Section 8 , and Article II , Sections 2 and 3 .	0	government
 6849 . In addition to these expressed powers , the national government was given implied powers that , while not clearly stated , are inferred .	0	government
 These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ” This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .	1	government
 Finally , Article VI declared that the U.S. Constitution and any laws or treaties made in connection with that document were to supersede constitutions and laws made at the state level .	1	government
 6852 . Throughout U.S. history , the national and state governments have battled for dominance over the implementation of public policy and the funding of important political programs .	0	government
 Upon taking office in 1933 during the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) , President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a series of legislative proposals to boost the economy and put people back to work .	0	government
 The enacted programs allowed the federal government to play a broader role in revitalizing the economy while greatly expanding its power .	0	government
 6855 . Johnson declared a “ War on Poverty , ” instituting a package of Great Society programs designed to improve circumstances for lower - income Americans across the nation .	1	government
 The new programs included Medicare and Medicaid , which are health insurance programs for seniors and low - income citizens respectively , and the food stamp program , which provides food assistance to low - income families .	0	government
 These initiatives greatly expanded the role of the federal government in providing a social safety net .

 She signed a bill into law that makes voter registration automatic for all citizens in the state with a driver ’s license .	0	government
 6867 . Given their focus on pursuing individual objectives , states with an individualistic mindset will tend to advance tax breaks as a way of trying to boost a state ’s economy or as a mechanism for promoting individual initiative and entrepreneurship .	0	government
 For instance , New Jersey governor Chris Christie made headlines in 2015 when discussing the incentives he used to attract businesses to the state .	0	government

 6897 . Under consecutive term limits , a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate , most commonly eight years .	0	government
 To try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met , the member will have to wait to run for office again .	0	government
 6900 . Interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization .	0	government
 This same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials . See note above .	0	government
 This presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature ’s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions , such as oversight .	0	government
 6909 . The activities by which government achieves these functions include — but are not limited to — taxation , homeland security , immigration , foreign affairs , and education .	0	government
 The more society grows and the need for government services expands , the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes .	0	government
 Public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations .	0	government

 6924 . While the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century , it also underwent a very different evolution .	0	government
 Beginning with the Pendleton Act in the 1880s , the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system .	0	government
 The distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial .	0	government

 Over time , Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts .	0	government

 6960 . In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .	0	government
 One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .	1	government
 6963 . While distributive policy , according to Lowi , has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits .	1	government
 A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society .	0	government
 6966 . A final type of policy is redistributive policy , so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another .	1	government
 That is , according to Lowi , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits .	0	government
 6972 . After completing a minimum number of years of work , American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age .	0	government
 It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group , and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment .	1	government

 About 50 percent of the approximately $ 1.2 trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government , including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings .	0	government
 6993 . As you would expect , Keynesians and supply - siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best .	0	government
 Keynesians , with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand , prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer ’s income increases .	0	government

 Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .	0	government
 Or it can be defensive , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , also known as Operation Desert Storm ( [ link ] ) .	0	government

 In the female cone , megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium .	0	biology
 1248 . Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 Self - pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time , and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower ’s stigma .	0	biology
 1251 . Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 After fertilization is complete , no other sperm can enter .	0	biology
 1254 . The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots .	0	biology
 In monocots , such as corn and wheat , the single cotyledon is called a scutellum ; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue ( xylem and phloem ) .	1	biology
 Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .	0	biology
 1257 . Tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) , tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) , and pepper ( Capsicum annuum ) are examples of endospermic dicots .	0	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization , but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage .	0	biology
 The two halves of a peanut seed ( Arachis hypogaea ) and the split peas ( Pisum sativum ) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves .	0	biology
 1260 . The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 In dicots , the hypocotyls extend above ground , giving rise to the stem of the plant .	0	biology
 1266 . Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings .	0	biology
 Some seeds require vernalization ( cold treatment ) before they can germinate .	1	biology
 This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring .	0	biology
 1269 . If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .	1	biology
 1272 . Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .	1	biology
 Together , all three are known as the pericarp .	0	biology
 1275 . Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses , citrus species , and other plants .	0	biology
 In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .	0	biology
 The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .	1	biology
 1278 . Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil .	1	biology
 Young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred .	0	biology
 1281 . Soon after flowering , these plants die .	0	biology
 Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime .	1	biology
 Fruit trees , such as apple and orange trees , are polycarpic ; they flower every year .	0	biology
 1284 . Limits on Animal Size and ShapeAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape : this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends .	1	biology
 This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds .	0	biology
 1287 . The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat .	0	biology
 1293 . A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 1302 . Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide : they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer , and are most commonly found in a single - layer arrangement .	1	biology
 The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1305 . Connective TissuesConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non - living substance , called the ground substance .	1	biology
 The ground substance is made of an organic substance ( usually a protein ) and an inorganic substance ( usually a mineral or water ) .	1	biology
 1308 . Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material .	1	biology
 The fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel .	0	biology
 1311 . The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	0	biology
 1314 . The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	0	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 Over time , these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient .	0	biology
 1317 . Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop .	0	biology
 It may either increase or decrease the stimulus , but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it .	0	biology
 1320 . Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system .	1	biology
 This is called acclimatization .	0	biology
 This occurs , for instance , when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to .	0	biology
 1323 . Carnivores are animals that eat other animals .	1	biology
 The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “ meat eater . ” Wild cats such as lions , shown in [ link]a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores , as are snakes and sharks , while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars , spiders , and ladybugs , shown in [ link]b .	0	biology
 1326 . The alimentary canal , shown in [ link]b , is a more advanced system : it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other .	1	biology
 Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal .	0	biology
 1329 . Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows , sheep , and goats , whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber .	1	biology
 They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose .	0	biology
 1332 . The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food .	0	biology
 The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing .	0	biology
 The tongue helps in swallowing — moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx .	0	biology
 1335 . A ring - like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system .	1	biology
 The gastro - esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus .	0	biology
 1338 . Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes .	0	biology
 The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme .	1	biology
 Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine .	0	biology
 1341 . The human small intestine is over 6 m long and is divided into three parts : the duodenum , the jejunum , and the ileum .	1	biology
 The “ C - shaped , ” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum .	1	biology
 1344 . Here , hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining .	0	biology
 The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum . The ileum , also illustrated in [ link ] is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream .	1	biology
 The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle .	0	biology
 1347 . The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination .	0	biology
 The anus is an opening at the far - end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material .	1	biology
 Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination : the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary .	0	biology
 1350 . The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts .	1	biology
 When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum , the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum .	0	biology
 1353 . Both fat - soluble and water - soluble vitamins must be obtained from food .	0	biology
 Minerals , listed in [ link ] , are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food .	1	biology
 Among their many functions , minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co - factors .	0	biology
 1356 . Pancreatic juices also contain amylase , which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose , a disaccharide .	1	biology
 The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases , sucrases , and lactases , which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall .	0	biology
 Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose .	0	biology
 1359 . The long - chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides , which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins .	1	biology
 These large spheres are called chylomicrons .	0	biology
 Chylomicrons contain triglycerides , cholesterol , and other lipids and have proteins on their surface .	0	biology
 1362 . The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions .	0	biology
 This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying .	0	biology
 1365 . Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 However , when the stomach is emptied , the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid .	0	biology
 This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism .	0	biology
 1368 . Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest .	0	biology
 A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed .	1	biology
 1371 . Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body .	0	biology
 The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .	1	biology
 An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .	1	biology
 1374 . Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath .	1	biology
 These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon .	0	biology
 1377 . Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	0	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .	1	biology
 1380 . This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .	1	biology
 1383 . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter .	0	biology
 Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential .	1	biology
 When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .	0	biology
 1386 . As K+ ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative .	0	biology
 The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell 's normal resting potential .	1	biology
 At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential .	0	biology
 1389 . Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft , the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 1392 . Signal SummationSometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential .	1	biology
 This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .	0	biology
 1395 . The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .	1	biology
 The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .	0	biology
 1398 . The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 1401 . It includes the cerebral cortex , limbic system , basal ganglia , thalamus , hypothalamus , and cerebellum .	0	biology
 There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures : a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in [ link]b , a coronal section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in [ link]a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . Cerebral CortexThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex , which is folded into hills called gyri ( singular : gyrus ) and valleys called sulci ( singular : sulcus ) .	1	biology
 The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .	0	biology
 1404 . The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain .	0	biology
 Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .	0	biology
 1407 . The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .	1	biology
 It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .	1	biology
 1410 . The thalamus ( Greek for “ inner chamber ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] , acts as a gateway to and from the cortex .	1	biology
 It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex .	0	biology
 1413 . It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala ( Greek for “ almond ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .	0	biology
 1416 . The brainstem , illustrated in [ link ] , connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord .	1	biology
 It consists of the midbrain , medulla oblongata , and the pons .	0	biology
 1419 . The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation .	1	biology
 One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake ( “ snake ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) .	0	biology
 1422 . While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and digest . ” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic , the parasympathetic nervous system is in control ( “ picnic ” and “ parasympathetic ” both start with “ p ” ) .	1	biology
 Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1425 . Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death .	1	biology
 These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die .	0	biology
 1428 . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder .	1	biology
 Its severity differs from person to person .	0	biology
 1431 . Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders .	1	biology
 To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder , a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed , changes in appetite and sleep schedules , difficulty concentrating , feelings of worthlessness , and suicidal thoughts .	0	biology
 1434 . Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	1	biology
 This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .	0	biology
 In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .	0	biology
 1437 . The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’s receptive field .	1	biology
 Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses .	0	biology
 1440 . Perception is an individual ’s interpretation of a sensation .	1	biology
 Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors , perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor , but at higher levels in the nervous system , in the brain .	0	biology
 1443 . Meissner ’s corpuscles , ( shown in [ link ] ) also known as tactile corpuscles , are found in the upper dermis , but they project into the epidermis .	1	biology
 They , too , are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids .	0	biology
 1446 . Neurons are not physically connected , but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or “ gaps ” between communicating neurons .	0	biology
 Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .	1	biology
 Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .	1	biology
 1449 . Audition , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions .	1	biology
 It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an approaching predator , and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating .	0	biology
 1452 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	0	biology
 1455 . The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear .	0	biology
 The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .	1	biology
 The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .	1	biology
 1458 . The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1461 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	1	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	0	biology
 The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 .	0	biology
 1464 . Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity , or brightness .	0	biology
 The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela , which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle .	1	biology
 1467 . The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 In conditions of high ambient light , the iris contracts , reducing the size of the pupil at its center .	0	biology
 1470 . For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina .	1	biology
 In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear .	0	biology
 1473 . Both rods and cones contain photopigments .	0	biology
 In vertebrates , the main photopigment , rhodopsin , has two main parts [ link ] ) : an opsin , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a cluster of α - helices that span the membrane ) , and retinal — a molecule that absorbs light .	1	biology
 When light hits a photoreceptor , it causes a shape change in the retinal , altering its structure from a bent ( cis ) form of the molecule to its linear ( trans ) isomer .	0	biology
 1476 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	0	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .	1	biology
 1479 . The first four tastes need little explanation .	0	biology
 The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later .	0	biology
 The taste of umami , also known as savoriness , is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L - glutamate .	1	biology
 1482 . Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 An olfactory receptor , which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron , responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain .	1	biology
 Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors , distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors .	0	biology
 1485 . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud .	1	biology
 A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 There are several structurally distinct papillae .	0	biology
 1488 . Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones .	1	biology
 1491 . The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain ( chain of amino acids ) .	0	biology
 The peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains , such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 1494 . In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1497 . In this way , nothing passes through the cell membrane ; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell .	0	biology
 The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger , which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 1500 . In this way , a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product .	0	biology
 To stop hormone activity , cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase , or PDE .	0	biology
 PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity , preventing overproduction of cellular products . The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm .	1	biology
 1503 . In some cases , the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones , which is referred to as neural stimuli .	1	biology
 Recall that in a short - term stress response , the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond .	0	biology
 1506 . The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release - inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus , and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1509 . The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 It is a part of the brain , extending down from the hypothalamus , and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells , which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary .	1	biology
 6111 . This outcome suggests that technology has created new avenues for obscene material to be disseminated .	0	government
 The Children ’s Internet Protection Act , however , requires K–12 schools and public libraries receiving Internet access using special E - rate discounts to filter or block access to obscene material and other material deemed harmful to minors , with certain exceptions .	1	government
 6114 . There has been increased conflict over the Second Amendment in recent years due to school shootings and gun violence .	0	government
 As a result , gun rights have become a highly charged political issue .	0	government
 6120 . The Third Amendment says in full :	0	government
 6123 . Furthermore , the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car ( [ link ] ) , or to search people entering the United States from another country . See , for example , Arizona v. Gant , 556 U.S. 332 ( 2009 ) .	0	government
 When a warrant is needed , law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction , but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found .	1	government
 Probable cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed ; it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof at a criminal trial .	0	government
 6126 . Many of the provisions dealing with the rights of the accused are included in the Fifth Amendment ; accordingly , it is one of the longest in the Bill of Rights .	0	government
 The Fifth Amendment states in full :	0	government
 6129 . Perhaps the most famous provision of the Fifth Amendment is its protection against self - incrimination , or the right to remain silent .	1	government
 This provision is so well known that we have a phrase for it : “ taking the Fifth . ” People have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might constitute an admission of guilt or responsibility for a crime .	0	government
 6132 . The greatest recent controversy over economic liberty has been sparked by cities’ and states’ use of the power of eminent domain to take property for redevelopment .	0	government
 Traditionally , the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads , highways , canals and reservoirs , and pipelines , which require fairly straight routes to be efficient .	0	government
 6135 . Most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial .	0	government
 This choice is typically the result of a plea bargain , an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge(s ) in question , or perhaps to less serious charges , in exchange for more lenient punishment than he or she might receive if convicted after a full trial .	1	government
 There are a number of reasons why this might happen .	0	government
 6138 . The Eighth Amendment says , in full :	0	government

 6147 . Although several state constitutions do list the right to privacy as a protected right , the explicit recognition by the Supreme Court of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century .	0	government
 In 1965 , the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v. Connecticut , a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception . Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and communications .	1	government

 But later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an election.“Court Case Abstracts , ” http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_W.shtml ( November 12 , 2015 ) ; Davis v. Federal Election Commission , 554 U.S. 724 ( 2008 ) .	0	government
 In 2010 , the Supreme Court ’s ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission led to the removal of spending limits on corporations .	1	government
 6366 . Despite the ease of voting using a ballot , primary elections have a number of rules and variations that can still cause confusion for citizens .	0	government
 In a closed primary , only members of the political party selecting nominees may vote .	1	government
 A registered Green Party member , for example , is not allowed to vote in the Republican or Democratic primary .	0	government
 6369 . Despite the common use of the primary system , at least five states ( Alaska , Hawaii , Idaho , Colorado , and Iowa ) regularly use caucuses for presidential , state , and local - level nominations .	0	government
 A caucus is a meeting of party members in which nominees are selected informally .	1	government
 Caucuses are less expensive than primaries because they rely on voting methods such as dropping marbles in a jar , placing names in a hat , standing under a sign bearing the candidate ’s name , or taking a voice vote .	0	government
 6372 . Add to this that primary and caucus voters are often more extreme in their political beliefs , and it is easy to see why fewer moderates become party nominees .	0	government
 The 2016 primary campaign by President Donald Trump shows that grabbing the media ’s attention with fiery partisan rhetoric can get a campaign started strong .	0	government
 This does not guarantee a candidate will make it through the primaries , however .	0	government
 6375 . Newspapers and cable news programs proclaim winners and losers , and debates can change the tide of a campaign .	0	government
 Yet , Paul Begala , a strategist with Bill Clinton ’s 1992 campaign , saw debates differently .	0	government
 6378 . Obama won in one congressional district and earned one electoral vote from Nebraska.“Presidential Popular Vote Summary for All Candidates Listed on at Least One State Ballot , ” http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2008/tables2008.pdf ( November 7 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 In 2016 , Republican Donald Trump won one congressional district in Maine , even though Hillary Clinton won the state overall .	0	government
 This Electoral College voting method is referred to as the district system .	0	government
 6381 . In fact , the more money a candidate raises , the more he or she will continue to raise .	0	government
 EMILY ’s List , a political action group , was founded on this principle ; its name is an acronym for “ Early Money Is Like Yeast ” ( it makes the dough rise ) .	1	government
 This group helps progressive women candidates gain early campaign contributions , which in turn helps them get further donations ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6384 . ( Huckabee , Christie , and Fiorina dropped out relatively early . )	0	government
 Democrats had to decide between Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders , and Martin O’Malley ( who soon dropped out ) .	0	government
 Voters must find more information about each candidate to decide which is closest to their preferred issue positions .	0	government
 6387 . Even before the Citizens United decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates , shadow campaigns existed .	0	government
 In 2004 , the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth organization ran ads attacking John Kerry ’s military service record , and MoveOn attacked George W. Bush ’s decision to commit to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .	0	government
 In 2014 , super PACs poured more than $ 300 million into supporting candidates.“Super PACs , ” https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php?cycle=2014 ( November 11 , 2015 ) .	0	government
 6390 . Citizens also use party identification to make decisions via straight - ticket voting — choosing every Republican or Democratic Party member on the ballot .	1	government
 In some states , such as Texas or Michigan , selecting one box at the top of the ballot gives a single party all the votes on the ballot ( [ link ] ) .	0	government
 6393 . There are three forms of direct democracy used in the United States .	0	government
 A referendum asks citizens to confirm or repeal a decision made by the government .	1	government
 A legislative referendum occurs when a legislature passes a law or a series of constitutional amendments and presents them to the voters to ratify with a yes or no vote .	1	government
 6396 . California was the first state to allow the use of medical marijuana , after the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 .	0	government
 Just a few years later , however , in Gonzales v. Raich ( 2005 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. government had the authority to criminalize the use of marijuana .	1	government
 In 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government would not seek to prosecute patients using marijuana medically , citing limited resources and other priorities .	0	government
 6399 . The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , passed by Congress in 1970 , declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act .	1	government
 And despite Holder ’s statement , a 2013 memo by James Cole , the deputy attorney general , reminded states that marijuana use is still illegal . James M. Cole , “ Memorandum for All United States Attorneys , ” U.S. Department of Justice , August 29 , 2013 , http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf .	0	government
 But the federal government can not enforce the CSA on its own ; it relies on the states’ help .	0	government
 6402 . Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders arrived in Seattle on August 8 , 2015 , to give a speech at a rally to promote his presidential campaign .	0	government
 Instead , the rally was interrupted — and eventually co - opted — by activists for Black Lives Matter ( [ link]).Dan Merica , “ Black Lives Matter Protesters Shut Down Sanders Event in Seattle , ” CNN , 10 August 2015 .	0	government
 Why did the group risk alienating Democratic voters by preventing Sanders from speaking ?	0	government
 Because Black Lives Matter had been trying to raise awareness of the treatment of black citizens in the United States , and the media has the power to elevate such issues.http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/ ( August 29 , 2015 ) .	1	government
 While some questioned its tactics , the organization ’s move underscores how important the media are to gaining recognition , and the lengths to which organizations are willing to go to get media attention . Conor Friedersdorf , “ A Conversation about Black Lives Matter and Bernie Sanders , ” The Atlantic , 21 August 2015 .	0	government
 6405 . The media also engages in agenda setting , which is the act of choosing which issues or topics deserve public discussion .	1	government
 For example , in the early 1980s , famine in Ethiopia drew worldwide attention , which resulted in increased charitable giving to the country .	0	government
 6408 . Although newspapers united for a common cause during the Revolutionary War , the divisions that occurred during the Constitutional Convention and the United States’ early history created a change .	0	government
 The publication of the Federalist Papers , as well as the Anti - Federalist Papers , in the 1780s , moved the nation into the party press era , in which partisanship and political party loyalty dominated the choice of editorial content .	0	government
 One reason was cost .	0	government
 1214 . Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .	1	biology
 Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand , silt , and humus ; these soils are called loams .	1	biology
 1217 . The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .	1	biology
 Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .	1	biology
 1220 . The soil profile has four distinct layers : 1 ) O horizon ; 2 ) A horizon ; 3 ) B horizon , or subsoil ; and 4 ) C horizon , or soil base ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter — humus — at its surface , with decomposed vegetation at its base .	1	biology
 Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention .	0	biology
 1226 . A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival .	0	biology
 Some parasitic plants have no leaves .	0	biology
 1229 . An epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants , but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Epiphytes have two types of roots : clinging aerial roots , which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees ; and aerial roots , which absorb moisture from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 1232 . The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .	0	biology
 Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .	0	biology
 After reaching maturity , the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis , which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte .	0	biology
 1235 . The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .	0	biology
 The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .	1	biology
 The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma , style , and ovary .	1	biology
 1238 . Female Gametophyte ( The Embryo Sac)While the details may vary between species , the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases .	0	biology
 First , in the process of megasporogenesis , a single cell in the diploid megasporangium — an area of tissue in the ovules — undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores , only one of which survives .	1	biology
 During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac .	1	biology
 1241 . This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .	0	biology
 Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells , which later degenerate .	0	biology
 The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete , or egg cell , and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1244 . Male GametophyteA male cone has a central axis on which bracts , a type of modified leaf , are attached .	0	biology
 The bracts are known as microsporophylls ( [ link ] ) and are the sites where microspores will develop .	1	biology
 The microspores develop inside the microsporangium .	0	biology
 1247 . Pollination takes two forms : self - pollination and cross - pollination .	0	biology
 Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 1250 . The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac , and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle .	0	biology
 Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1253 . The terminal cell also divides , giving rise to a globular - shaped proembryo ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 In dicots ( eudicots ) , the developing embryo has a heart shape , due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons ( [ link]b ) .	1	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , such as Capsella bursa , the endosperm develops initially , but is then digested , and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons .	1	biology
 1256 . The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo .	0	biology
 In endospermic dicots , the food reserves are stored in the endosperm .	0	biology
 During germination , the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves , much like in monocots ( monocots , by definition , also have endospermic seeds ) .	0	biology
 1259 . The embryonic axis consists of three parts : the plumule , the radicle , and the hypocotyl .	1	biology
 The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 1262 . The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .	1	biology
 The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .	1	biology
 This shape is called the plumule hook , and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark .	0	biology
 1265 . Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity , or extremely low metabolic activity : a process known as dormancy , which may last for months , years or even centuries .	1	biology
 Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions .	0	biology
 1268 . Fruits may be classified as simple , aggregate , multiple , or accessory , depending on their origin ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 1271 . An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .	0	biology
 Accessory fruits ( sometimes called false fruits ) are not derived from the ovary , but from another part of the flower , such as the receptacle ( strawberry ) or the hypanthium ( apples and pears ) .	1	biology
 1274 . Either the ovule or part of the ovary , which is diploid in nature , gives rise to a new seed .	1	biology
 This method of reproduction is known as apomixis .	0	biology
 1277 . Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings , where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root .	1	biology
 In some species , stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water .	0	biology
 1280 . In another classification based on flowering frequency , monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime ; examples include bamboo and yucca .	1	biology
 During the vegetative period of their life cycle ( which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species ) , these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once - in - a - lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization .	0	biology
 1283 . They are asymmetrical , radial , or bilateral in form as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry ; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge .	1	biology
 Radial symmetry , as illustrated in [ link ] , describes when an animal has an up - and - down orientation : any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves , but not a definite right or left side .	1	biology
 1286 . No energy system is one hundred percent efficient , and an animal ’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat .	0	biology
 If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature , it is classified as a warm - blooded animal and called an endotherm .	1	biology
 The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 1289 . Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor .	0	biology
 Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions .	1	biology
 Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .	0	biology
 1292 . A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes .	0	biology
 A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 1295 . A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .	1	biology
 This is sometimes called a cross section , and , if the transverse cut is at an angle , it is called an oblique plane .	1	biology
 1298 . Epithelial TissuesEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells .	1	biology
 The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells .	0	biology
 1301 . Cuboidal epithelial cells , shown in [ link ] , are cube - shaped with a single , central nucleus .	1	biology
 They are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material .	0	biology
 1304 . Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system , primarily in the bladder and ureter .	1	biology
 These cells are arranged in a stratified layer , but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed , empty bladder , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1307 . Loose connective tissue , also called areolar connective tissue , has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue .	1	biology
 As illustrated in [ link ] , loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts ; macrophages are present as well .	0	biology
 1310 . Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .	1	biology
 The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	1	biology
 1313 . A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .	1	biology
 The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	1	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 1316 . The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point .	1	biology
 While there are normal fluctuations from the set point , the body ’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point .	0	biology
 1319 . Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level .	0	biology
 This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop .	0	biology
 1322 . Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant - based .	1	biology
 Examples of herbivores , as shown in [ link ] include vertebrates like deer , koalas , and some bird species , as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars .	0	biology
 1328 . Because most birds fly , their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low .	0	biology
 The stomach of birds has two chambers : the proventriculus , where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach , and the gizzard , where the food is stored , soaked , and mechanically ground .	1	biology
 The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated .	0	biology
 1331 . Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .	1	biology
 Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .	1	biology
 Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides .	0	biology
 1334 . The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .	0	biology
 The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The peristalsis wave is unidirectional — it moves food from the mouth to the stomach , and reverse movement is not possible .	0	biology
 1337 . Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber .	0	biology
 Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen .	1	biology
 Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides ; it also helps activate more pepsinogen , starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin .	0	biology
 1340 . The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein , fats , and carbohydrates is completed .	1	biology
 The small intestine is a long tube - like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger - like projections called the villi .	1	biology
 The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli .	1	biology
 1346 . The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation .	0	biology
 1349 . The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices .	0	biology
 The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature ; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate , an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme .	1	biology
 1352 . The omega-3 alpha - linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids .	0	biology
 Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and , for this reason , are considered to be co - enzymes .	1	biology
 Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health , as outlined in [ link ] and [ link ] .	0	biology
 1355 . Digestion and AbsorptionDigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments .	1	biology
 It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium .	0	biology
 1358 . Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases ( those that break down peptides ) .	1	biology
 Specifically , carboxypeptidase , dipeptidase , and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids .	0	biology
 The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines .	0	biology
 1361 . The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach .	1	biology
 It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase .	0	biology
 1364 . One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment .	0	biology
 During the gastric phase , the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins .	0	biology
 Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 1367 . In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .	1	biology
 Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .	0	biology
 Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices , it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum .	1	biology
 1370 . Neurons also contain unique structures , illustrated in [ link ] for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible .	0	biology
 Dendrites are tree - like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses .	1	biology
 Although some neurons do not have any dendrites , some types of neurons have multiple dendrites .	0	biology
 1373 . Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons .	0	biology
 Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction .	1	biology
 This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes .	0	biology
 1376 . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses .	0	biology
 Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	1	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 1379 . One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .	0	biology
 This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 1382 . Voltage - gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell .	0	biology
 The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential .	1	biology
 1385 . To accomplish this , the Na+ channels close and can not be opened .	0	biology
 This begins the neuron 's refractory period , in which it can not produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open .	0	biology
 At the same time , voltage - gated K+ channels open , allowing K+ to leave the cell .	0	biology
 1388 . This depolarization causes voltage - gated Ca2 + channels to open .	0	biology
 Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane - bound vesicles , called synaptic vesicles , containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 Synaptic vesicles are shown in [ link ] , which is an image from a scanning electron microscope .	0	biology
 1391 . This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .	0	biology
 Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .	1	biology
 For example , when the neurotransmitter GABA ( gamma - aminobutyric acid ) is released from a presynaptic neuron , it binds to and opens Cl- channels .	0	biology
 1394 . Long - term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long - term weakening of a synaptic connection .	1	biology
 One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors .	0	biology
 1397 . The dura mater also contains vein - like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart .	0	biology
 The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 1400 . The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .	1	biology
 The brain floats in CSF , which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant .	0	biology
 1403 . The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain , over the eyes .	1	biology
 This lobe contains the olfactory bulb , which processes smells .	0	biology
 1406 . The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain .	1	biology
 It is primarily involved in vision — seeing , recognizing , and identifying the visual world .	0	biology
 1409 . Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) , shown in [ link]b , play important roles in movement control and posture .	1	biology
 Damage to the basal ganglia , as in Parkinson ’s disease , leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking .	0	biology
 1412 . The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion , as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation .	1	biology
 It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 1415 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) , shown in [ link ] , sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem .	1	biology
 The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks .	0	biology
 1418 . The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system , which controls bodily functions without conscious control , and the sensory - somatic nervous system , which transmits sensory information from the skin , muscles , and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles .	1	biology
 1421 . The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .	1	biology
 Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs .	1	biology
 As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive .	0	biology
 1424 . Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body .	1	biology
 Each of the 31 spinal nerves ( in humans ) contains both sensory and motor axons .	0	biology
 1427 . Like Alzheimer ’s disease , Parkinson ’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease .	1	biology
 It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817 .	0	biology
 1430 . Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States .	0	biology
 Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination , inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations .	0	biology
 1433 . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration .	1	biology
 Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation .	1	biology
 Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	0	biology
 1436 . The first step in sensation is reception , which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being bent or squished , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature .	1	biology
 The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 1439 . How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?	0	biology
 In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in [ link ] ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure .	1	biology
 Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential .	0	biology
 1442 . A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions .	0	biology
 Merkel ’s disks ( shown in [ link ] ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates .	1	biology
 Merkel ’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips .	0	biology
 1445 . Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors .	0	biology
 It is not surprising , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli . Pacinian corpuscles ( seen in [ link ] ) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner ’s corpuscles ; they are found in the bone periosteum , joint capsules , pancreas and other viscera , breast , and genitals .	1	biology
 They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient ( but not prolonged ) pressure and high - frequency vibration .	0	biology
 1448 . Pain is the name given to nociception , which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage .	1	biology
 Pain is caused by true sources of injury , such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical .	0	biology
 1451 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 1454 . The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	1	biology
 The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .	0	biology
 The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup .	0	biology
 1457 . The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid ( perilymph ) inside the cochlea .	0	biology
 The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1460 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	0	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	1	biology
 1463 . Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images .	1	biology
 Animals are bombarded with sensory information , and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic .	0	biology
 1466 . It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ( [ link]b ) .	0	biology
 The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 1469 . Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .	0	biology
 Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short .	1	biology
 For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 1472 . The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision .	1	biology
 The fovea has a high density of cones .	0	biology
 1475 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	1	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1478 . Taste , also called gustation , and smell , also called olfaction , are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors .	1	biology
 Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival .	0	biology
 1481 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .	1	biology
 Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 1484 . PheromonesA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species .	1	biology
 Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them , but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors .	0	biology
 1487 . Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin , unmyelinated axons .	1	biology
 The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli , and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor , so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant .	1	biology
 From glomeruli , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus .	0	biology
 1490 . The amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan , shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 If a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ -ine ” .	0	biology
 1493 . Additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity .	0	biology
 In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1496 . Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid - derived ( lipid - soluble ) and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells .	0	biology
 Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors .	1	biology
 Unlike steroid hormones , lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on DNA .	0	biology
 1499 . When a hormone binds to the receptor , the G - protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , in place of GDP .	0	biology
 After binding , GTP is hydrolysed by the G - protein into GDP and becomes inactive . The activated G - protein in turn activates a membrane - bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase .	0	biology
 Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP .	1	biology
 1502 . Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone .	1	biology
 A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands .	0	biology
 1505 . It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 1508 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .	1	biology
 This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .	1	biology
 A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another ; therefore , the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones : growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , melanin - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .	1	biology
 1511 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .	0	biology
 It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system .	0	biology

 2121 . Muslims , however , retained control of much of Spain , where Córdoba , known for leather and wool production , became a major center of learning and trade .	0	history
 By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .	1	history
 This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .	1	history
 2124 . Although there were large trading centers along these rivers , most West Africans lived in small villages and identified with their extended family or their clan .	0	history

 2139 . For this reason , Pilgrims are known as Separatists . Like Jamestown , Plymouth occupies an iconic place in American national memory .	0	history
 The tale of the 102 migrants who crossed the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower and their struggle for survival is a well - known narrative of the founding of the country .	0	history
 Their story includes the signing of the Mayflower Compact , a written agreement whereby the English voluntarily agreed to help each other .	1	history
 2145 . American silver , tobacco , and other items , which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes , became European commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold .	0	history
 Before the arrival of the Spanish , for example , the Inca people of the Andes consumed chicha , a corn beer , for ritual purposes only .	1	history
 When the Spanish discovered chicha , they bought and traded for it , turning it into a commodity instead of a ritual substance .	0	history
 2148 . In eastern North America , some native peoples interpreted death from disease as a hostile act .	0	history
 Some groups , including the Iroquois , engaged in raids or “ mourning wars , ” taking enemy prisoners in order to assuage their grief and replace the departed .	1	history
 In a special ritual , the prisoners were “ requickened”—assigned the identity of a dead person — and adopted by the bereaved family to take the place of their dead .	1	history
 2151 . Columbus ’s 1493 letter — or probanza de mérito ( proof of merit)—describing his “ discovery ” of a New World did much to inspire excitement in Europe .	1	history
 Probanzas de méritos were reports and letters written by Spaniards in the New World to the Spanish crown , designed to win royal patronage .	0	history
 2154 . Calvinism emphasized human powerlessness before an omniscient God and stressed the idea of predestination , the belief that God selected a few chosen people for salvation while everyone else was predestined to damnation .	1	history
 Calvinists believed that reading scripture prepared sinners , if they were among the elect , to receive God ’s grace .	0	history
 2157 . Nonetheless , those indentured servants who completed their term of service often began new lives as tobacco planters .	0	history
 To entice even more migrants to the New World , the Virginia Company also implemented the headright system , in which those who paid their own passage to Virginia received fifty acres plus an additional fifty for each servant or family member they brought with them .	1	history
 The headright system and the promise of a new life for servants acted as powerful incentives for English migrants to hazard the journey to the New World .	0	history
 2160 . In 1565 , the victorious Menéndez founded St. Augustine , now the oldest European settlement in the Americas .	1	history
 In the process , the Spanish displaced the local Timucua Indians from their ancient town of Seloy , which had stood for thousands of years ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 The Timucua suffered greatly from diseases introduced by the Spanish , shrinking from a population of around 200,000 pre - contact to fifty thousand in 1590 .	0	history
 2163 . Everywhere , Africans resisted slavery , and running away was common .	0	history
 In Jamaica and elsewhere , runaway slaves created maroon communities , groups that resisted recapture and eked out a living from the land , rebuilding their communities as best they could .	1	history
 When possible , they adhered to traditional ways , following spiritual leaders such as Vodun priests .	0	history
 2166 . Conflict with native peoples , as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch West India Company ’s trading practices , made the Dutch outpost an undesirable place for many migrants .	0	history
 The small size of the population meant a severe labor shortage , and to complete the arduous tasks of early settlement , the Dutch West India Company imported some 450 African slaves between 1626 and 1664 .	0	history
 ( The company had involved itself heavily in the slave trade and in 1637 captured Elmina , the slave - trading post on the west coast of Africa , from the Portuguese . )	1	history
 2169 . The final imperial war , the French and Indian War ( 1754–1763 ) , known as the Seven Years’ War ( 1756–1763 ) in Europe , proved to be the decisive contest between Britain and France in America .	1	history
 It began over rival claims along the frontier in present - day western Pennsylvania .	0	history
 2172 . In England , opponents of James II ’s efforts to create a centralized Catholic state were known as Whigs .	1	history

There they exhibited a fine example of industry , by spinning from sunrise until dark , and displayed a spirit for saving their sinking country rarely to be found among persons of more age and experience . ” At dinner , they “ cheerfully agreed to omit tea , to render their conduct consistent .	0	history
 Besides this instance of their patriotism , before they separated , they unanimously resolved that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional , that they would purchase no more British manufactures unless it be repealed , and that they would not even admit the addresses of any gentlemen should they have the opportunity , without they determined to oppose its execution to the last extremity , if the occasion required . ” The Daughters’ non - importation movement broadened the protest against the Stamp Act , giving women a new and active role in the political dissent of the time .	0	history
 Women were responsible for purchasing goods for the home , so by exercising the power of the purse , they could wield more power than they had in the past .	0	history

 2223 . Responding to a request for advice on proper government from North Carolina , Adams wrote Thoughts on Government , which influenced many state legislatures .	0	history
 Adams did not advocate democracy ; rather , he wrote , “ there is no good government but what is republican . ” Fearing the potential for tyranny with only one group in power , he suggested a system of checks and balances in which three separate branches of government — executive , legislative , and judicial — would maintain a balance of power .	0	history
 He also proposed that each state remain sovereign , as its own republic .	0	history
 2226 . James Madison put forward a proposition known as the Virginia Plan , which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws ( [ link ] ) .	1	history

 2232 . Thus , to avoid giving the people too much direct power , the delegates made certain that senators were chosen by the state legislatures , not elected directly by the people ( direct elections of senators came with the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1913 ) .	0	history
 As an additional safeguard , the delegates created the Electoral College , the mechanism for choosing the president .	1	history
 Under this plan , each state has a certain number of electors , which is its number of senators ( two ) plus its number of representatives in the House of Representatives .	0	history
 2235 . Federalists followed through on their promise to add such a bill in 1789 , when Virginia Representative James Madison introduced and Congress approved the Bill of Rights ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Adopted in 1791 , the bill consisted of the first ten amendments to the Constitution and outlined many of the personal rights state constitutions already guaranteed .	1	history
 2238 . Opposition to the Federalists led to the formation of Democratic - Republican societies , composed of men who felt the domestic policies of the Washington administration were designed to enrich the few while ignoring everyone else .	1	history
 Democratic - Republicans championed limited government .	0	history
 Their fear of centralized power originated in the experience of the 1760s and 1770s when the distant , overbearing , and seemingly corrupt British Parliament attempted to impose its will on the colonies .	0	history
 2241 . President Washington and Hamilton denounced Genêt , knowing his actions threatened to pull the United States into a war with Great Britain .	0	history
 The Citizen Genêt affair , as it became known , spurred Great Britain to instruct its naval commanders in the West Indies to seize all ships trading with the French .	0	history

 2298 . The 1840s were a particularly active time in the creation and reorganization of political parties and constituencies , mainly because of discontent with the positions of the mainstream Whig and Democratic Parties in regard to slavery and its extension into the territories .	0	history
 The first new party , the small and politically weak Liberty Party founded in 1840 , was a single - issue party , as were many of those that followed it .	0	history
 Its members were abolitionists who fervently believed slavery was evil and should be ended , and that this was best accomplished by political means .	0	history
 2301 . In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time , southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories .	0	history
 Many in the Free - Soil Party believed in this far - reaching conspiracy of the slaveholding elite to control both foreign affairs and domestic policies for their own ends , a cabal that came to be known as the Slave Power .	1	history
 2304 . By 1860 , the region was producing two - thirds of the world ’s cotton .	0	history
 In 1793 , Eli Whitney revolutionized the production of cotton when he invented the cotton gin , a device that separated the seeds from raw cotton .	1	history
 Suddenly , a process that was extraordinarily labor - intensive when done by hand could be completed quickly and easily .	0	history
 2307 . Southern whites frequently relied upon the idea of paternalism — the premise that white slaveholders acted in the best interests of slaves , taking responsibility for their care , feeding , discipline , and even their Christian morality — to justify the existence of slavery .	1	history
 This grossly misrepresented the reality of slavery , which was , by any measure , a dehumanizing , traumatizing , and horrifying human disaster and crime against humanity .	0	history
 2310 . The North also produced defenders of slavery , including Louis Agassiz , a Harvard professor of zoology and geology .	0	history
 Agassiz helped to popularize polygenism , the idea that different human races came from separate origins .	1	history
 According to this formulation , no single human family origin existed , and blacks made up a race wholly separate from the white race .	0	history
 2313 . The reform efforts of the antebellum era sprang from the Protestant revival fervor that found expression in what historians refer to as the Second Great Awakening .	1	history
 ( The First Great Awakening of evangelical Protestantism had taken place in the 1730s and 1740s . )	0	history
 2316 . Beginning in the 1820s , a new intellectual movement known as transcendentalism began to grow in the Northeast .	0	history
 In this context , to transcend means to go beyond the ordinary sensory world to grasp personal insights and gain appreciation of a deeper reality , and transcendentalists believed that all people could attain an understanding of the world that surpassed rational , sensory experience .	1	history
 2319 . The Shakers provide another example of a community established with a religious mission .	0	history
 The Shakers started in England as an outgrowth of the Quaker religion in the middle of the eighteenth century .	0	history
 2322 . Thereafter , most temperance societies advocated total abstinence ; no longer would beer and wine be tolerated .	0	history
 Such total abstinence from alcohol is known as teetotalism .	1	history
 2325 . During the early nineteenth century , reformers also interested themselves in the workings of the mind in an effort to better understand the effects of a rapidly changing world awash with religious revivals and democratic movements .	0	history
 Phrenology — the mapping of the cranium to specific human attributes — stands as an early type of science , related to what would become psychology and devoted to understanding how the mind worked .	1	history
 Phrenologists believed that the mind contained thirty - seven “ faculties , ” the strengths or weaknesses of which could be determined by a close examination of the size and shape of the cranium ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2328 . They rejected colonization as a racist scheme and opposed the use of violence to end slavery .	0	history
 Influenced by evangelical Protestantism , Garrison and other abolitionists believed in moral suasion , a technique of appealing to the conscience of the public , especially slaveholders .	1	history
 Moral suasion relied on dramatic narratives , often from former slaves , about the horrors of slavery , arguing that slavery destroyed families , as children were sold and taken away from their mothers and fathers ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2331 . The issue of what to do with the western territories added to the republic by the Mexican Cession consumed Congress in 1850 .	0	history
 Other controversial matters , which had been simmering over time , complicated the problem further .	0	history
 2334 . As these different factions were agitating for the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska , leaders of the Democratic Party in 1853 and 1854 sought to bind their party together in the aftermath of intraparty fights over the distribution of patronage jobs .	0	history
 Illinois Democratic senator Stephen Douglas believed he had found a solution — the Kansas - Nebraska bill — that would promote party unity and also satisfy his colleagues from the South , who detested the Missouri Compromise line .	0	history
 In January 1854 , Douglas introduced the bill ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2337 . The events in Kansas served as an extreme reply to Douglas ’s proposition of popular sovereignty .	0	history
 As the violent clashes increased , Kansas became known as “ Bleeding Kansas . ” Antislavery advocates’ use of force carved out a new direction for some who opposed slavery .	0	history
 Distancing themselves from William Lloyd Garrison and other pacifists , Brown and fellow abolitionists believed the time had come to fight slavery with violence .	0	history
 2340 . Douglas portrayed the Republican Party as an abolitionist effort — one that aimed to bring about miscegenation , or race - mixing through sexual relations or marriage .	1	history
 The “ black Republicans , ” Douglas declared , posed a dangerous threat to the Constitution .	0	history
 2343 . In October 1859 , the radical abolitionist John Brown and eighteen armed men , both blacks and whites , attacked the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry , Virginia .	0	history
 They hoped to capture the weapons there and distribute them among slaves to begin a massive uprising that would bring an end to slavery .	0	history
 2346 . Indeed , by the time of the Corwin amendment ’s passage through Congress , Confederate forces in the Deep South had already begun to take over federal forts .	0	history
 The loss of Fort Sumter , in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina , proved to be the flashpoint in the contest between the new Confederacy and the federal government .	0	history
 A small Union garrison of fewer than one hundred soldiers and officers held the fort , making it a vulnerable target for the Confederacy .	0	history
 2349 . General George B. McClellan , the general in chief of the army , responsible for overall control of Union land forces , proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the Confederates .	0	history
 In direct command of the Army of the Potomac , the Union fighting force operating outside Washington , DC , McClellan believed , incorrectly , that Confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle .	0	history
 His cautious nature made him popular with his men but not with the president or Congress .	0	history
 2352 . By late 1862 , the course of the war had changed to take on the characteristics of total war , in which armies attempt to demoralize the enemy by both striking military targets and disrupting their opponent ’s ability to wage war through destruction of their resources .	1	history
 In this type of war , armies often make no distinction between civilian and military targets .	0	history
 2355 . A Union campaign to convince individuals to buy the bonds helped increase sales .	0	history
 The Republicans also passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862 , calling for paper money — known as greenbacks — to be printed [ link ] ) .	1	history
 Some $ 150 million worth of greenbacks became legal tender , and the Northern economy boomed , although high inflation also resulted .	0	history
 2358 . After the featured orator had delivered a two - hour speech , Lincoln addressed the crowd for several minutes .	0	history
 In his speech , known as the Gettysburg Address , which he had finished writing while a guest in David Wills’ home the day before the dedication , Lincoln invoked the Founding Fathers and the spirit of the American Revolution .	0	history
 The Union soldiers who had died at Gettysburg , he proclaimed , had died not only to preserve the Union , but also to guarantee freedom and equality for all .	0	history
 2361 . Northern Democrats railed against Lincoln and the war .	0	history
 Republicans labeled these vocal opponents of the President Copperheads , a term that many antiwar Democrats accepted .	0	history
 As the anti - Lincoln poster below illustrates , his enemies tried to paint him as an untrustworthy and suspect leader ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 2364 . However , the proposal instantly drew fire from a larger faction of Republicans in Congress who did not want to deal moderately with the South .	1	history
 These members of Congress , known as Radical Republicans , wanted to remake the South and punish the rebels .	0	history
 Radical Republicans insisted on harsh terms for the defeated Confederacy and protection for former slaves , going far beyond what the president proposed .	0	history
 2367 . However , they faced the wrath of defeated but un - reconciled southerners who were determined to keep blacks an impoverished and despised underclass .	0	history
 Recognizing the widespread devastation in the South and the dire situation of freed people , Congress created the Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands in March 1865 , popularly known as the Freedmen ’s Bureau .	0	history
 Lincoln had approved of the bureau , giving it a charter for one year .	0	history
 2370 . However , Congress mustered the necessary votes to override his veto .	0	history
 Despite the Civil Rights Act , the black codes endured , forming the foundation of the racially discriminatory Jim Crow segregation policies that impoverished generations of African Americans .	0	history
 2373 . Black voter registration in the late 1860s and the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment finally brought what Lincoln had characterized as “ a new birth of freedom . ” Union Leagues , fraternal groups founded in the North that promoted loyalty to the Union and the Republican Party during the Civil War , expanded into the South after the war and were transformed into political clubs that served both political and civic functions .	1	history
 As centers of the black communities in the South , the leagues became vehicles for the dissemination of information , acted as mediators between members of the black community and the white establishment , and served other practical functions like helping to build schools and churches for the community they served .	0	history
 2376 . Paramilitary white - supremacist terror organizations in the South helped bring about the collapse of Reconstruction , using violence as their primary weapon .	0	history
 The “ Invisible Empire of the South , ” or Ku Klux Klan , stands as the most notorious .	0	history
 The Klan was founded in 1866 as an oath - bound fraternal order of Confederate veterans in Tennessee , with former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest as its first leader .	0	history
 2379 . Congress also passed a series of three laws designed to stamp out the Klan .	0	history
 Passed in 1870 and 1871 , the Enforcement Acts or “ Force Acts ” were designed to outlaw intimidation at the polls and to give the federal government the power to prosecute crimes against freed people in federal rather than state courts .	1	history
 Congress believed that this last step , a provision in the third Enforcement Act , also called the Ku Klux Klan Act , was necessary in order to ensure that trials would not be decided by white juries in southern states friendly to the Klan .	0	history
 2382 . The concept of Manifest Destiny found its roots in the long - standing traditions of territorial expansion upon which the nation itself was founded .	0	history
 This phrase , which implies divine encouragement for territorial expansion , was coined by magazine editor John O’Sullivan in 1845 , when he wrote in the United States Magazine and Democratic Review that “ it was our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our multiplying millions . ” Although the context of O’Sullivan ’s original article was to encourage expansion into the newly acquired Texas territory , the spirit it invoked would subsequently be used to encourage westward settlement throughout the rest of the nineteenth century .	1	history
 2385 . The first houses built by western settlers were typically made of mud and sod with thatch roofs , as there was little timber for building .	0	history
 Rain , when it arrived , presented constant problems for these sod houses , with mud falling into food , and vermin , most notably lice , scampering across bedding ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 Weather patterns not only left the fields dry , they also brought tornadoes , droughts , blizzards , and insect swarms .	0	history
 2388 . In 1859 , Henry T. P. Comstock , a Canadian - born fur trapper , began gold mining in Nevada with other prospectors but then quickly found a blue - colored vein that proved to be the first significant silver discovery in the United States .	0	history
 Within twenty years , the Comstock Lode , as it was called , yielded more than $ 300 million in shafts that reached hundreds of feet into the mountain .	0	history
 Subsequent mining in Arizona and Montana yielded copper , and , while it lacked the glamour of gold , these deposits created huge wealth for those who exploited them , particularly with the advent of copper wiring for the delivery of electricity and telegraph communication .	0	history
 2391 . The final episode in the so - called Indian Wars occurred in 1890 , at the Battle of Wounded Knee in South Dakota .	0	history
 On their reservation , the Sioux had begun to perform the “ Ghost Dance , ” which told of an Indian Messiah who would deliver the tribe from its hardship , with such frequency that white settlers began to worry that another uprising would occur .	1	history
 2394 . One of the greatest advancements was the telephone , which Alexander Graham Bell patented in 1876 ( [ link ] ) .	0	history
 While he was not the first to invent the concept , Bell was the first one to capitalize on it ; after securing the patent , he worked with financiers and businessmen to create the National Bell Telephone Company .	0	history
 2397 . Carnegie ’s famous essay , The Gospel of Wealth , featured below , expounded on his beliefs .	0	history
 In it , he borrowed from Herbert Spencer ’s theory of social Darwinism , which held that society developed much like plant or animal life through a process of evolution in which the most fit and capable enjoyed the greatest material and social success .	1	history
 2400 . tolerated the presence of the most gigantic , the most cruel , impudent , pitiless and grasping monopoly that ever fastened itself upon a country.”Seeking still more control , Rockefeller recognized the advantages of controlling the transportation of his product .	0	history
 He next began to grow his company through vertical integration , wherein a company handles all aspects of a product ’s lifecycle , from the creation of raw materials through the production process to the delivery of the final product .	1	history
 In Rockefeller ’s case , this model required investment and acquisition of companies involved in everything from barrel - making to pipelines , tanker cars to railroads .	0	history
 2403 . This solitary and repetitive work style was a difficult adjustment for those used to more collaborative and skill - based work , whether on farms or in crafts shops .	0	history
 Managers embraced Fredrick Taylor ’s principles of scientific management , also called “ stop - watch management , ” where he used stop - watch studies to divide manufacturing tasks into short , repetitive segments .	1	history
 A mechanical engineer by training , Taylor encouraged factory owners to seek efficiency and profitability over any benefits of personal interaction .	0	history
 2406 . Urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the United States for a number of reasons .	0	history
 The new technologies of the time led to a massive leap in industrialization , requiring large numbers of workers .	0	history
 2409 . The primary form of relief for working - class urban Americans , and particularly immigrants , came in the form of machine politics .	0	history
 This phrase referred to the process by which every citizen of the city , no matter their ethnicity or race , was a ward resident with an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall .	1	history
 2412 . These included more expensive excursions , such as vacations in Newport , Rhode Island , winter relocation to sunny Florida , and frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe .	0	history
 For those who were not of the highly respected “ old money , ” but only recently obtained their riches through business ventures , the relief they sought came in the form of one book — the annual Social Register .	0	history
 First published in 1886 by Louis Keller in New York City , the register became a directory of the wealthy socialites who populated the city .	1	history
 4918 . To build a useful macroeconomic model , we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level .	1	economic
 This model is called the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model .	0	economic
 This module will explain aggregate supply , aggregate demand , and the equilibrium between them .	0	economic
 4921 . If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right .	0	economic
 At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions .	1	economic
 At these relatively low levels of output , levels of unemployment are high , and many factories are running only part - time , or have closed their doors .	0	economic
 4924 . This demand is determined by a number of factors , but one of them is the price level — recall though , that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy .	1	economic
 The aggregate demand ( AD ) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level .	1	economic
 [ link ] presents an aggregate demand ( AD ) curve .	0	economic
 Just like the aggregate supply curve , the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level .	0	economic
 4927 . In the long run , however , producers are limited to producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 4930 . Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .	1	economic
 One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita .	0	economic
 Over time , productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output .	0	economic
 4933 . The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month .	0	economic
 The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu , which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels .	0	economic
 4939 . The AD / AS model can be used to illustrate both Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law that demand creates its own supply .	0	economic
 Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in [ link ] : the Keynesian zone , the neoclassical zone , and the intermediate zone . Keynes , Neoclassical , and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium Ek , in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve , small shifts in AD , either to the right or the left , will affect the output level Yk , but will not much affect the price level .	0	economic
 4942 . Finally , consider the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve in [ link ] .	0	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei , then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions .	0	economic
 4945 . The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .	0	economic
 Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap , with its attendant unemployment , for a significant period of time . In the same way ( though not shown in the figure ) , if AD increases , the economy could experience an inflationary gap , where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output .	1	economic
 As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .	0	economic
 4948 . Disposable income : For most people , the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take - home pay , also known as disposable income , which is income after taxes .	1	economic
 4954 . Instead , prices and wages are “ sticky , ” making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP .	0	economic
 Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky : the coordination argument .	0	economic
 This argument points out that , even if most people would be willing — at least hypothetically — to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline , a market - oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions .	1	economic
 4957 . A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier .	0	economic
 The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP , but that spending is powerful .	1	economic
 4960 . The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation .	0	economic
 Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation , which became known as a Phillips curve .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows a theoretical Phillips curve , and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States .	0	economic
 4963 . Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right .	1	economic
 For example , if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf , where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment .	0	economic
 4969 . This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .	0	economic
 Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run	0	economic
 4975 . One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed .	0	economic
 The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can , using all information available to them .	1	economic
 In an economy where most people have rational expectations , economic adjustments may happen very quickly .	0	economic
 4978 . As inflation fluctuates , so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods .	0	economic
 The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate , plus an expected inflation factor .	1	economic
 Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy .	0	economic
 4981 . Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?As explained in Unemployment , unemployment can be divided into two categories : cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment , which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment .	1	economic
 Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP — giving potential employers less incentive to hire .	1	economic
 4984 . Each approach , Keynesian and neoclassical , has its strengths and weaknesses . The short - term Keynesian model , built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity , does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls .	1	economic
 By focusing on the short - run adjustments of aggregate demand , Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long - term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 4987 . The discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics .	0	economic
 At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .	0	economic
 We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .	0	economic
 4990 . Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .	1	economic
 In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .	1	economic
 For example , if an accountant wants a pair of shoes , this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services .	0	economic
 4993 . This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value .	0	economic
 In an economy with inflation , money loses some buying power each year , but it remains money . Third , money serves as a unit of account , which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured .	0	economic
 For example , an accountant may charge $ 100 to file your tax return .	0	economic
 4996 . Gold , silver , cowrie shells , cigarettes , and even cocoa beans have been used as money .	0	economic
 Although these items are used as commodity money , they also have a value from use as something other than money .	0	economic
 Gold , for example , has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes .	0	economic
 4999 . Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money , economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity .	0	economic
 Liquidity refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service .	1	economic
 For example , cash is very liquid .	0	economic
 5002 . M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .	1	economic
 Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .	0	economic
 These are the amounts held in checking accounts .	1	economic
 5005 . Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	1	economic
 Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .	1	economic
 In short , all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend , but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 [ link ] should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2 .	0	economic
 5008 . Until you pay the credit card bill , you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company .	0	economic
 With a smart card , you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases .	0	economic
 Some “ smart cards ” used for specific purposes , like long - distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria , are not really all that smart , because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places . In short , credit cards , debit cards , and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made .	0	economic
 5011 . Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .	0	economic
 Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money .	1	economic
 Thus , banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries — they bring savers and borrowers together .	0	economic
 5014 . A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run .	1	economic
 Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member .	0	economic
 5017 . If you own a home , this is also considered an asset .	0	economic
 A liability is a debt or something you owe .	1	economic
 Many people borrow money to buy homes .	0	economic
 5020 . [ link ] illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank .	0	economic
 Because of the two - column format of the balance sheet , with the T - shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “ Assets ” and “ Liabilities , ” it is sometimes called a T - account .	0	economic
 5023 . These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset : The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future .	0	economic
 In our example , the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $ 4 million . The final entry under assets is reserves , which is money that the bank keeps on hand , and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds — and thus does not lead to interest payments .	1	economic
 The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “ reserve , ” which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank .	0	economic
 5026 . The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank ’s liabilities , namely the deposits of its customers , can be withdrawn quickly , but many of the bank ’s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades . This asset - liability time mismatch — a bank ’s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term — can cause severe problems for a bank .	0	economic
 For example , imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate , but then sees interest rates rise substantially .	0	economic
 5029 . In making decisions about the money supply , a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and , in this way , to influence macroeconomic policy , whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation .	1	economic
 The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation ’s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank ’s balance sheet .	0	economic
 5032 . The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .	0	economic
 In early 2014 , Janet L. Yellen , shown in [ link ] became the first woman to hold this post .	0	economic
 Yellen has been described in the media as “ perhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history . ” With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University , Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard , the London School of Economics , and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley .	0	economic
 5035 . Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .	0	economic
 In Money and Banking , we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves .	0	economic
 “ On hand ” is a bit of a misnomer because , while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank , the majority are held in the bank ’s account at the Federal Reserve , and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors .	0	economic
 5038 . The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) supervises credit unions , which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members .	1	economic
 There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy , though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks . The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions .	0	economic
 5041 . To protect against bank runs , Congress has put two strategies into place : deposit insurance and the lender of last resort .	0	economic
 Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money , even if the bank goes bankrupt .	1	economic
 5044 . The most important function of the Federal Reserve is to conduct the nation ’s monetary policy .	0	economic
 Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “ to coin money ” and “ to regulate the value thereof . ” As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve , Congress delegated these powers to the Fed .	0	economic

As a result of the Panic , the Federal Reserve was founded to be the “ lender of last resort . ” In the event of a bank run , sound banks , ( banks that were not bankrupt ) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed ’s discount “ window ” to quell the bank run . The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate .	1	economic

 5059 . In late 2008 , as the U.S. economy struggled with recession , the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near - zero .	0	economic
 With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .	0	economic
 This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .	1	economic
 5065 . Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .	0	economic
 The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .	0	economic
 5068 . Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative ; that is , instead of money having less purchasing power over time , as occurs with inflation , money is worth more .	1	economic
 Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession .	0	economic
 5071 . If velocity is constant over time , then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left - hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP — although this change could happen through an increase in inflation , or an increase in real GDP , or some combination of the two .	0	economic
 If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way , then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP .	0	economic
 5077 . By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .	0	economic
 A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States , which does not practice inflation - targeting .	0	economic
 Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .	0	economic
 5080 . For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .	0	economic

With these exceptions duly noted , most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling , buying , hiring , borrowing , traveling , or investing across national borders .	0	economic

 Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) refers to purchasing a firm ( at least ten percent ) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example , in 2008 the Belgian beer - brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer - maker Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion .	1	economic
 To make this purchase of a U.S. firm , InBev would have to supply euros ( the currency of Belgium ) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars .	0	economic
 5092 . Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank , and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers .	1	economic
 These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .	0	economic
 This is called the interbank market .	0	economic
 5095 . This means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries ( in this case , the United States and Canada ) , the depreciation ( or weakening ) of one country ( the U.S. dollar for this example ) indicates the appreciation ( or strengthening ) of the other currency ( which in this example is the Canadian dollar ) .	1	economic

 5113 . The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways .	0	economic
 One approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates .	0	economic
 In foreign exchange markets , the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation .	0	economic
 5116 . When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate , it faces a number of tradeoffs .	0	economic
 If it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate , it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession .	0	economic
 If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates , then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency .	0	economic
 5119 . If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .	0	economic

 5122 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .	1	economic
 For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .	0	economic
 Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country .	0	economic
 5125 . The choice depends both on how well a nation ’s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation ’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies .	0	economic
 A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals .	0	economic

 The common name for corporate income is “ profits . ” Over time , corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP , from about 4 % in the 1960s to an average of 1 % to 2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .	0	economic
 5140 . Having discussed the revenue ( taxes ) and expense ( spending ) side of the budget , we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus , which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year , which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year .	0	economic
 5149 . Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates , fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected .	0	economic
 This is referred to as crowding out , where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates , which reduces business investment and household consumption .	1	economic

 In 2006 , before the start of the Great Recession , the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6 % , compared with 9 % in France , 10.4 % in Germany , and 7.1 % in Sweden .	0	economic
 The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe , which dates back to the 1970s , is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs . Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice .	0	economic
 5185 . The economies of Europe thrive with high levels of trade .	0	economic
 In the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the United States , Canada , and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers .	1	economic
 Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy .	0	economic
 5188 . In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .	0	economic
 A trade surplus , you may remember , exists when a nation ’s exports exceed its imports .	1	economic

 5197 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .	1	economic
 The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .	0	economic
 For example , if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper , its labor , land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as corn .	0	economic
 5200 . Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .	0	economic

 ( Strictly speaking , AD is what economists call total planned expenditure .	0	economic
 4926 . U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .	0	economic
 U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .	0	economic
 Thus , a higher domestic price level , relative to price levels in other countries , will reduce net export expenditures .	0	economic
 4929 . In the long run , the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth .	0	economic
 Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .	1	economic
 4932 . When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy , they tend to consume more .	1	economic
 If business confidence is high , then firms tend to spend more on investment , believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial .	0	economic
 Conversely , if consumer or business confidence drops , then consumption and investment spending decline .	0	economic
 4935 . During a recession , when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses , the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts .	0	economic
 During the recession of 2001 , for example , a tax cut was enacted into law .	0	economic
 4938 . In many of the national economies across Europe , the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10 % or a bit lower , even in good economic years .	0	economic
 This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market .	1	economic
 Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy .	1	economic
 4941 . Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side .	0	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy .	0	economic
 4944 . Because AD is volatile , it can easily fall .	0	economic
 Thus , even if we start at Yp , if AD falls , then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap .	0	economic
 The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .	0	economic
 4947 . Nondurable goods are things like groceries — once you consume them , they are gone .	1	economic
 Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy , like healthcare or entertainment . Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption :	0	economic
 4950 . Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items .	0	economic
 The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate .	0	economic
 Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital .	1	economic
 4953 . First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand .	1	economic
 We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed .	1	economic
 4956 . In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level .	1	economic
 For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales .	0	economic
 4959 . In the 1950s , A.W .	0	economic
 Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework .	0	economic
 4962 . The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation .	0	economic
 In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears .	0	economic
 Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift .	0	economic
 4965 . In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern .	0	economic
 The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left .	0	economic
 The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment .	0	economic
 4968 . The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?	0	economic
 This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .	0	economic
 Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run	0	economic
 4971 . Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done .	1	economic
 Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software .	0	economic
 4974 . Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical .	0	economic
 In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy .	0	economic
 4977 . Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work .	1	economic
 Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion .	1	economic
 After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later .	0	economic
 4980 . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation .	0	economic
 The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T]here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”	0	economic
 4983 . If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model , in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures .	0	economic

 Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :	0	economic
 4989 . Economies without money typically engage in the barter system .	0	economic
 Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .	1	economic
 In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .	1	economic
 4992 . Second , money must serve as a store of value .	0	economic
 In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services .	0	economic
 4995 . Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future .	1	economic
 So money serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment .	1	economic
 4998 . As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome .	0	economic
 Countries moved towards the use of fiat money .	0	economic
 Fiat money has no intrinsic value , but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country .	1	economic
 5001 . There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .	1	economic
 Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .	0	economic
 5004 . For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	1	economic
 Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .	1	economic
 5007 . It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 Although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you .	0	economic
 When you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller , and at the end of the month , the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month .	0	economic
 5010 . Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets .	1	economic
 Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .	0	economic
 5013 . Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	1	economic
 All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool , which is then loaned out .	0	economic
 5016 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 For example , the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition .	0	economic
 5019 . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	0	economic
 A bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital .	1	economic
 A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults , monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to customers , and bonds .	1	economic
 5022 . The second category of bank asset is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and nonprofit organizations .	1	economic
 A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the U.S. government .	0	economic
 5025 . The bank will be more willing to make what are called “ subprime loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down - payment , little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that .	1	economic
 Some subprime loans made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income , No Job , or Assets . These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities — but with a twist .	0	economic
 The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage - backed securities , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , 5 % of such losses .	0	economic

 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .	0	economic
 5040 . In this situation , whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough , lost their money .	0	economic
 Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run .	1	economic
 In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .	0	economic

 For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money .	0	economic
 5046 . The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations .	1	economic
 The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors .	0	economic
 5049 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5052 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 5055 . If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential GDP , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP .	0	economic
 [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .	0	economic
 5058 . [ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades .	0	economic
 The graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market operations ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since 1975 .	0	economic
 Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure .	0	economic
 5061 . Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .	0	economic
 First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills .	1	economic
 In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .	0	economic
 5064 . If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans .	0	economic
 Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .	0	economic
 The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .	0	economic
 5067 . Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used .	0	economic
 Consider the velocity of M1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances .	0	economic
 In 2009 , for example , M1 was $ 1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $ 14.3 trillion , so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ( $ 14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion ) .	0	economic
 5070 . This equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form .	0	economic
 This equation must hold true , by definition .	0	economic
 5073 . In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate .	0	economic
 These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central bankers , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects .	0	economic
 5076 . This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low .	1	economic
 By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .	0	economic
 5079 . One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .	0	economic
 For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .	1	economic
 The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .	0	economic
 5082 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 In good economic times , this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth .	0	economic
 5085 . Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor .	0	economic
 For example , Ecuador , El Salvador , and Panama have decided to dollarize — that is , to use the U.S. dollar as their currency .	1	economic
 Sometimes nations share a common currency .	0	economic
 5088 . In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa .	0	economic
 To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership .	0	economic
 Let ’s consider these categories in turn .	0	economic
 5091 . Let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is .	0	economic
 You can hedge , which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) .	1	economic
 Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time .	0	economic
 5094 . When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different .	0	economic
 When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening.”To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) .	1	economic
 The vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ 1 in U.S. currency , measured in terms of Canadian currency .	0	economic
 5097 . In the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars .	0	economic
 What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ?	0	economic
 The answer to this question is discussed in the following section .	0	economic
 5100 . The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods .	1	economic
 5103 . Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency .	0	economic
 As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole .	0	economic
 5106 . Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers .	0	economic
 When most of a country ’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously , a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results .	0	economic
 Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy .	0	economic
 5109 . In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % .	0	economic
 ( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS ) The line 's variations represent the volatility of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5112 . A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies .	0	economic
 5115 . Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation .	0	economic
 Alternatively , Brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 5118 . Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market .	0	economic
 If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .	0	economic
 Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .	0	economic
 5121 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .	1	economic
 For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .	0	economic
 5124 . A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency .	1	economic
 A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether .	0	economic
 5127 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	1	economic
 All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government .	0	economic
 5130 . Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes .	0	economic
 5133 . Together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80 % of federal tax revenues in 2014 .	0	economic
 Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases .	1	economic
 Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .	0	economic
 5136 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5139 . As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts .	0	economic
 These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .	0	economic
 5142 . Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .	0	economic
 5145 . The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom .	1	economic
 5148 . Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates .	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % .	1	economic
 5151 . Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time .	0	economic
 The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag .	1	economic
 Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .	0	economic
 5154 . Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities .	0	economic
 The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy .	1	economic
 5157 . The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal .	0	economic
 However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit .	0	economic
 For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits .	0	economic
 5160 . How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?	0	economic
 In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP .	0	economic
 However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 .	0	economic
 5163 . If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment . However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity .	0	economic
 5166 . The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772–1823 ) .	1	economic
 If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .	0	economic
 5169 . First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey .	0	economic
 If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros . The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession .	0	economic
 Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997–1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 .	0	economic
 5172 . For example , life expectancy at birth in many low - income regions approximates those who are more affluent .	0	economic
 The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living .	0	economic
 For instance , despite very high income levels , there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America .	0	economic
 5175 . The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore .	1	economic
 The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan , although these are often treated under international law as part of China , rather than as separate countries .	0	economic
 5178 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .	0	economic
 The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5181 . In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution . However , the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp .	0	economic
 5184 . Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent .	0	economic
 It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies .	1	economic
 5187 . Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports exceed its exports .	0	economic
 In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .	0	economic
 5190 . It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , shifting the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left .	0	economic
 The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession .	0	economic
 People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy , with its great size , is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets .	0	economic
 5193 . World War I severed many economic connections .	0	economic
 During the Great Depression of the 1930s , many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others .	0	economic
 World War II further hindered international trade .	0	economic
 5196 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .	0	economic
 The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .	0	economic
 5199 . The United States produces / consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn .	0	economic
 Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .	0	economic
 With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .	0	economic
 5202 . Then , in the numerical example given , Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators .	0	economic
 Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade .	0	economic
 Mexico will be unambiguously better off .	0	economic
 5205 . What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?	0	economic
 There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale .	0	economic
 5208 . A second broad reason that intra - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale .	0	economic
 The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point .	1	economic
 [ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens .	0	economic
 5211 . Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .	1	economic
 Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .	0	economic
 Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .	0	economic
 5214 . Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services .	0	economic
 They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .	0	economic
 5217 . ( We ’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter . )	0	economic
 This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world .	0	economic
 It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , quotas , and nontariff barriers .	1	economic
 4919 . Profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs , like labor or raw materials , the firm needs to buy .	0	economic
 Aggregate supply ( AS ) refers to the total quantity of output ( i.e .	1	economic
 real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .	1	economic
 4922 . When an economy is operating at its potential GDP , machines and factories are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 For this reason , potential GDP is sometimes also called full - employment GDP .	0	economic
 4925 . The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world .	0	economic
 U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .	0	economic
 U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .	0	economic
 4928 . For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .	0	economic
 4931 . For example , the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975 , 1980–1982 , 1990–91 , 2001 , and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices .	0	economic
 In the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation . Conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs .	0	economic
 From 1985 to 1986 , for example , the average price of crude oil fell by almost half , from $ 24 a barrel to $ 12 a barrel .	0	economic
 4934 . If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion . Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too .	0	economic
 Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to diminish it .	0	economic
 Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment .	0	economic
 4937 . Two types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter .	0	economic
 Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short - run movements of GDP .	1	economic
 Over the long run , in the United States , the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5 % ( give or take one percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy .	0	economic
 4940 . Focus first on the Keynesian zone , that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat .	1	economic
 If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow .	0	economic
 4943 . The idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell .	0	economic
 Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy .	1	economic
 This point is illustrated in [ link].The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output .	0	economic
 4946 . As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .	0	economic
 The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services .	1	economic
 ( Aggregate demand ( AD ) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure .	0	economic
 4949 . Spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure .	1	economic
 Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) .	0	economic
 4952 . ) Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects .	1	economic
 The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks .	0	economic
 First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .	0	economic
 4955 . Second , frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected .	1	economic
 These costs of changing prices are called menu costs — like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant .	0	economic
 Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time .	0	economic
 4958 . Thus , when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP .	0	economic
 The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .	0	economic
 4961 . Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation .	0	economic
 This pattern became known as stagflation .	0	economic
 ( Recall from The Aggregate Demand / Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation . )	1	economic
 4964 . He proposed that the government could bury money underground , and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again .	0	economic
 These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP .	0	economic
 4967 . The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment .	0	economic
 This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output .	0	economic
 4970 . Actual or real GDP is benchmarked against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing .	0	economic
 Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .	0	economic
 4973 . Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .	0	economic
 A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand .	0	economic
 Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right .	0	economic
 4976 . After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works .	0	economic
 An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory .	1	economic
 If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut .	0	economic
 4979 . The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve .	0	economic
 The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run .	0	economic
 4982 . Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment .	0	economic
 Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low .	0	economic
 4985 . However , the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years .	0	economic
 Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s .	0	economic
 Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment .	0	economic
 4988 . At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 : economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .	0	economic
 We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .	0	economic
 With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing .	1	economic
 4991 . ( We will get to its definition soon . )	0	economic
 First , money serves as a medium of exchange , which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller .	0	economic
 Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes , the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money .	0	economic
 4994 . Finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment .	0	economic
 This means that if money is usable today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future .	1	economic
 4997 . Of course , gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry . As commodity money , gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account .	0	economic
 Commodity - backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank .	1	economic
 During much of its history , the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver .	0	economic
 5000 . less liquid . The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity .	1	economic
 There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .	0	economic
 5003 . A broader definition of money , M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits .	0	economic
 For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .	1	economic
 Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .	0	economic
 5006 . Where does “ plastic money ” like debit cards , credit cards , and smart money fit into this picture ?	0	economic
 A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller .	1	economic
 It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .	0	economic
 5009 . One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts .	0	economic
 Indeed , the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system .	0	economic
 The next section explains how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money .	0	economic
 5012 . Banks as Financial IntermediariesAn “ intermediary ” is one who stands between two other parties .	1	economic
 Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .	1	economic
 Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .	0	economic
 5015 . A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .	1	economic
 An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .	1	economic
 5018 . In this case , a home is the asset , but the mortgage is the liability .	0	economic
 The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed ( the liability ) . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .	1	economic
 5021 . Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments .	0	economic
 The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market . One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?	1	economic
 The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid , the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan .	0	economic
 5024 . Securitization offers certain advantages .	0	economic
 If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments .	0	economic
 5027 . Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers . How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset - liability time mismatch ?	0	economic
 One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans , which means lending to a variety of customers .	1	economic
 For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area .	0	economic
 5030 . The organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation ’s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank .	1	economic
 Most nations have central banks or currency boards .	0	economic
 5033 . A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve .	0	economic
 The goal is not only to protect individuals’ savings , but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself .	0	economic
 5036 . Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks .	0	economic
 They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .	1	economic
 In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .	0	economic
 5039 . The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always straightforward .	0	economic
 As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid .	1	economic
 These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan . The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off .	0	economic
 5042 . About 70 countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs .	0	economic
 In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is responsible for deposit insurance .	1	economic
 Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC .	0	economic
 5045 . The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations .	0	economic
 Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates .	1	economic
 5048 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .	1	economic
 If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .	0	economic
 5051 . A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .	1	economic
 Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .	1	economic
 5054 . Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time .	0	economic
 In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise .	0	economic
 5057 . In [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) occurs at an output of 750 , which is above potential GDP .	0	economic
 A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings .	1	economic
 Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens .	0	economic
 5060 . With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .	0	economic
 This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .	1	economic
 5063 . Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit .	0	economic
 For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans .	0	economic
 5066 . Unpredictable Movements of VelocityVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy .	1	economic
 The velocity of money in a year is defined as :	0	economic
 5069 . Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation .	1	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate .	0	economic
 If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and there is deflation of 2 % , then the real interest rate is actually 9 % .	0	economic
 5072 . So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 .	0	economic
 Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking , M2 is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1 .	0	economic
 5075 . In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .	0	economic
 If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment .	0	economic
 From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy .	0	economic
 5078 . Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .	0	economic
 For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP .	0	economic
 In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment .	0	economic
 5081 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .	1	economic
 Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .	1	economic
 5084 . This chapter discusses the international dimension of money , which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate .	0	economic
 An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand .	1	economic
 The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates .	0	economic
 5087 . You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters .	0	economic
 In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies .	0	economic
 These earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature .	0	economic
 5090 . The other kind of international financial investment , portfolio investment , involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility .	1	economic
 An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom , or deposited money in a British bank .	0	economic
 5093 . These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .	0	economic
 This is called the interbank market .	0	economic
 5096 . The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market .	0	economic
 The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos .	0	economic
 Note that the two exchange rates are inverses : 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso ( or $ 0.10 per peso ) .	0	economic
 5099 . If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars .	0	economic
 This is known as arbitrage , the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit .	1	economic
 It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries .	0	economic
 5102 . A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country .	0	economic
 Let ’s discuss these scenarios in turn . Exchange Rates , Aggregate Demand , and Aggregate Supply	0	economic
 5105 . In 1997–1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more .	0	economic
 These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital , with bank lending increasing by 20 % to 30 % per year through the mid-1990s .	0	economic
 When their exchange rates depreciated , the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt .	0	economic
 5108 . A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate .	1	economic
 The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate , as are the currencies of about 40 % of the countries in the world economy .	0	economic
 5111 . When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency .	1	economic
 A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .	1	economic
 With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .	1	economic
 5114 . The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency .	0	economic
 In this way , it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency .	0	economic
 5117 . For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg .	0	economic
 With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate .	0	economic
 With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg .	0	economic
 5120 . Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act .	0	economic
 The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment .	0	economic
 5123 . But proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties .	0	economic
 Taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones .	0	economic
 5126 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !	0	economic
 Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .	0	economic
 While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .	0	economic
 5129 . When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .	1	economic
 Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .	1	economic
 If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .	1	economic
 5132 . When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .	0	economic
 The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue . The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .	0	economic
 Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time .	0	economic
 5135 . The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .	1	economic
 The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .	1	economic
 5138 . The federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue .	0	economic
 It imposes an excise tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .	1	economic
 As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .	0	economic
 5141 . Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits .	0	economic
 The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year .	1	economic
 [ link ] shows the ratio of debt / GDP since 1940 .	0	economic
 5144 . The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries .	0	economic
 Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels .	1	economic
 The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .	0	economic
 5147 . In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past .	0	economic
 On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ” The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”This happy consensus , however , did not last .	0	economic
 The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 .	0	economic
 5150 . It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip .	0	economic
 The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag .	1	economic
 After this lag , policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills .	0	economic
 5153 . Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement .	0	economic
 After all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers .	0	economic
 5156 . The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .	0	economic
 The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded . The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings . Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .	1	economic
 5159 . If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .	0	economic
 When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out . To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .	1	economic
 In 2005 , for example , the budget deficit was roughly 4 % of GDP .	0	economic
 5162 . Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment .	0	economic
 If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .	0	economic
 5165 . Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education .	0	economic
 If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role .	0	economic
 5168 . Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits .	0	economic
 [ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar , measured in euros .	0	economic
 At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s ) .	0	economic
 5171 . You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .	0	economic
 As explained in The Macroeconomic Perspective , we must consider using purchasing power parity or “ international dollars ” to convert average incomes into comparable units .	0	economic
 Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries . The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution .	0	economic
 5174 . Where does economic growth come from ?	0	economic
 According to most economists who believe in the growth consensus , economic growth ( as discussed in Economic Growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements .	0	economic
 In turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all interacting in a market - driven economy .	0	economic
 5177 . Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital .	0	economic
 Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty . For example , the average citizen of Burundi , the lowest - income country , subsists on $ 150 per year ( adjusted to 2005 dollars ) .	0	economic
 According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop .	0	economic
 5180 . The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .	0	economic
 In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .	0	economic
 There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .	0	economic
 5183 . Policymakers of the high - income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation .	0	economic
 First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term .	0	economic
 5186 . There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns .	0	economic
 These arguments are discussed at some length in The International Trade and Capital Flows . Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade , perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument ; that is , subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established .	1	economic
 ( Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail . )	0	economic
 5189 . Instead of offering net financial investment abroad , the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world .	0	economic
 These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research .	0	economic
 While trade deficits on their own are not bad , the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily .	0	economic
 5192 . The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I .	0	economic
 Over that time , global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1 % of GDP in 1820 to 9 % of GDP in 1913 .	0	economic
 5195 . A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good .	1	economic
 Absolute advantage can be the result of a country ’s natural endowment .	0	economic
 5198 . To simplify , let ’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours ( see [ link ] ) .	0	economic
 We illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) graph , shown in [ link ] .	0	economic

 1520 . The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans , as visible in the micrograph shown in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin . These hormones regulate blood glucose levels .	1	biology
 1523 . The kidneys also release calcitriol , which aids in the absorption of Ca2 + and phosphate ions .	1	biology

 1526 . Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over - hydration ( hyponatremia ) .	1	biology
 The water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus , which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid .	1	biology
 The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration , inadequate water intake , or low blood volume due to blood loss .	0	biology
 1532 . Regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland , the adrenal cortex , and the gonads .	0	biology
 During puberty in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , which stimulates the production and release of follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland .	1	biology
 These hormones regulate the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) and therefore are called gonadotropins .	1	biology
 1538 . In order to manage nutrient intake , storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary , the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores .	0	biology
 Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas , which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise ( for example , after a meal is consumed ) .	1	biology
 Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells , which use glucose for ATP production .	0	biology
 1547 . T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .	0	biology
 TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .	0	biology
 Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid , and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine .	0	biology
 1550 . In children , hypothyroidism can cause cretinism , which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects .	0	biology

 Graves’ disease is one example of a hyperthyroid condition .	0	biology
 1562 . In a long - term stress response , the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids .	1	biology
 Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells .	0	biology
 1565 . Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing ’s disease , characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body .	1	biology

 The ulna is located on the medial aspect ( pinky - finger side ) of the forearm .	1	biology
 1592 . The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton .	1	biology
 Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion , the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments .	0	biology
 1595 . The femur , or thighbone , is the longest , heaviest , and strongest bone in the body .	1	biology
 The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the proximal end .	0	biology
 1598 . It is the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot .	0	biology
 The fibula , or calf bone , parallels and articulates with the tibia .	1	biology
 It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight .	0	biology
 1601 . The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint , or articulation .	1	biology
 Joints are responsible for movement , such as the movement of limbs , and stability , such as the stability found in the bones of the skull .	0	biology
 1604 . Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue , allowing for more movement than in a suture .	1	biology
 An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle .	0	biology
 1613 . Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other .	1	biology
 Gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones .	0	biology

 1631 . Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .	1	biology
 Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .	1	biology
 Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .	1	biology
 1634 . Planar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces .	1	biology
 These joints allow for gliding movements , and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints .	0	biology
 1637 . Condyloid joints consist of an oval - shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval - shaped hollow of another bone ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint .	0	biology
 1640 . Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles , which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can be consciously controlled .	1	biology
 Because it can be controlled by thought , skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle .	0	biology
 1643 . Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart , and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure .	1	biology
 Like skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle is striated , but unlike skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle can not be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle .	1	biology
 1646 . Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line .	0	biology
 The Z discs mark the border of units called sarcomeres , which are the functional units of skeletal muscle .	1	biology
 One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band , one on either side of the A band .	0	biology
 1649 . Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .	1	biology
 Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .	1	biology
 The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance , as there is little space between the filaments .	0	biology
 1652 . Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron , which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle .	1	biology
 The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate .	1	biology
 The end of the neuron ’s axon is called the synaptic terminal , and it does not actually contact the motor end plate .	1	biology
 1655 . The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite , a mineral formed from calcium phosphate .	0	biology
 Calcification is the process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue .	1	biology
 The process of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1658 . The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .	1	biology
 The rounded ends , the epiphyses , are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Most of the limb bones are long bones — for example , the femur , tibia , ulna , and radius .	0	biology
 1661 . Irregular bones are bones with complex shapes .	1	biology
 These bones may have short , flat , notched , or ridged surfaces .	0	biology
 1664 . Compact bone ( or cortical bone ) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity , or bone marrow .	1	biology
 It provides protection and strength to bones .	0	biology
 1667 . Each osteon consists of lamellae , which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal .	1	biology
 The Haversian canal ( osteonic canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing .	0	biology
 1670 . Bone consists of four types of cells : osteoblasts , osteoclasts , osteocytes , and osteoprogenitor cells .	0	biology
 Osteoblasts are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation .	1	biology
 Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue , and collagen fibers .	0	biology
 1673 . Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix .	1	biology
 Osteoprogenitor cells are squamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts .	1	biology
 Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures .	0	biology
 1676 . Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage .	1	biology
 All of the bones of the body , except for the flat bones of the skull , mandible , and clavicles , are formed through endochondral ossification .	0	biology
 1679 . Bone renewal continues after birth into adulthood .	0	biology
 Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue .	1	biology

 1682 . The right lung is larger and contains three lobes , whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The muscular diaphragm , which facilitates breathing , is inferior to ( below ) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity . The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs .	1	biology
 The right lung is made of three lobes and is larger .	0	biology
 1685 . Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .	0	biology
 Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .	0	biology
 Like the trachea , the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle .	0	biology
 1688 . The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .	0	biology
 At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .	0	biology
 1691 . If particulates do make it beyond the nose , or enter through the mouth , the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain several protective devices .	0	biology
 The lungs produce mucus — a sticky substance made of mucin , a complex glycoprotein , as well as salts and water — that traps particulates .	1	biology
 The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia , small hair - like projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1694 . The volume in the lung can be divided into four units : tidal volume , expiratory reserve volume , inspiratory reserve volume , and residual volume .	0	biology
 Tidal volume ( TV ) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath .	1	biology
 On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .	0	biology
 1697 . Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .	1	biology
 The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .	1	biology
 The lungs are never completely empty : There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation .	0	biology
 1700 . It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .	0	biology
 The functional residual capacity ( FRC ) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume .	0	biology
 The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .	1	biology
 1703 . Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .	0	biology
 An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .	1	biology
 In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .	1	biology
 1706 . To increase the volume of the lungs , the chest wall expands .	0	biology
 This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles , the muscles that are connected to the rib cage .	1	biology
 Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract , thus expanding the thoracic cavity .	0	biology
 1709 . A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .	0	biology
 Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .	0	biology
 1712 . On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .	0	biology
 The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation , or how much air moves into and out of the alveoli .	1	biology
 Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli .	0	biology
 1715 . Babies born prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant .	0	biology
 As a result , they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome , because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs .	0	biology
 Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli .	0	biology
 1718 . In these types of restrictive diseases , the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation , which traps air in the lungs .	0	biology
 Forced or functional vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible , is much lower than in normal patients , and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is greatly prolonged ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A patient suffering from these diseases can not exhale the normal amount of air .	0	biology
 1721 . At times , however , there is a mismatch between the amount of air ( ventilation , V ) and the amount of blood ( perfusion , Q ) in the lungs .	1	biology
 This is referred to as ventilation / perfusion ( V / Q ) mismatch .	0	biology
 1724 . HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .	0	biology
 1727 . The oxygen - carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood .	0	biology
 In addition to	0	biology
 1730 . This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide .	0	biology
 When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin , a molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed .	0	biology
 Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible .	0	biology
 1733 . However , hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and thus limits shifts in pH .	0	biology
 The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion ( Cl- ) ; this is called the chloride shift .	1	biology
 When the blood reaches the lungs , the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion .	0	biology
 1736 . In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .	1	biology
 As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .	0	biology
 This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange .	0	biology
 1739 . This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .	0	biology
 The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .	1	biology
 In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .	1	biology
 1742 . The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen - rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit .	0	biology
 For this reason , amphibians are often described as having double circulation . Most reptiles also have a three - chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits , as shown in [ link]c . The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum , which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood .	0	biology
 1745 . Red blood cells , or erythrocytes ( erythro- = “ red ” ; -cyte = “ cell ” ) , are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells ; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow .	1	biology
 In mammals , red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7–8 µm in size .	0	biology
 1748 . In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .	1	biology
 This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve , a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood .	1	biology
 The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .	1	biology
 1751 . The heart is composed of three layers ; the epicardium , the myocardium , and the endocardium , illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .	1	biology
 The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .	1	biology
 1754 . The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood .	0	biology
 The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .	1	biology
 They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .	0	biology
 1757 . Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .	0	biology
 The slowdown of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain , known as angina , and complete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction : the death of cardiac muscle tissue , commonly known as a heart attack .	1	biology
 1760 . The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells , or cardiomyocytes , that make up the heart muscle .	0	biology
 Cardiomyocytes , shown in [ link ] , are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle ; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle .	1	biology
 They are self - stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes .	0	biology
 1763 . The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Arteries take blood away from the heart .	1	biology
 The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs .	1	biology
 1766 . Fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries .	0	biology
 The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .	0	biology
 Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .	1	biology
 1769 . Blood pressure ( BP ) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body .	1	biology
 Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating .	1	biology
 1772 . Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute .	1	biology
 It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute ( heart rate ) times the stroke volume ( the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle ) .	1	biology
 Therefore , cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate , as when exercising .	0	biology
 1775 . Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .	1	biology
 An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .	1	biology
 A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .	1	biology
 1778 . In order to calculate osmotic pressure , it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured .	0	biology
 The unit for measuring solutes is the mole .	0	biology
 One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute .	1	biology
 1781 . Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms .	1	biology
 This is possible because some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments .	0	biology
 When they live in fresh water , their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic , as illustrated in [ link]a .	0	biology
 1784 . Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration .	0	biology
 The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called urine .	1	biology
 1787 . The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .	0	biology
 The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .	0	biology
 Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .	0	biology
 1790 . The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .	1	biology
 The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .	1	biology
 In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .	1	biology
 1793 . The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .	1	biology
 The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .	0	biology
 On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .	1	biology
 1796 . The arteries , veins , and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum .	0	biology
 Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .	0	biology
 The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .	0	biology
 1799 . Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .	0	biology
 The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .	0	biology
 The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .	1	biology
 1802 . There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .	1	biology
 A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries .	1	biology
 1805 . The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex .	1	biology
 The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .	1	biology
 The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .	1	biology
 1808 . The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole .	1	biology
 The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole .	1	biology
 Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .	1	biology
 1811 . First , the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus .	0	biology
 Almost all solutes , except for proteins , are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration .	0	biology
 Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .	0	biology
 1814 . There is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process .	0	biology
 Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) is the volume of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys .	1	biology
 GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important indicator of kidney function .	0	biology
 3615 . We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth .	0	psychology
 Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .	1	psychology
 One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .	1	psychology
 3621 . The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .	0	psychology
 The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3624 . We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory .	0	psychology
 The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron .	1	psychology
 This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave .	0	psychology
 3627 . Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .	0	psychology
 Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound .	1	psychology
 3630 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .	1	psychology
 Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .	1	psychology
 3633 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .	1	psychology
 One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .	0	psychology
 3636 . This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .	0	psychology
 Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array .	1	psychology
 The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain .	0	psychology
 3639 . You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste : sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .	0	psychology
 Research demonstrates , however , that we have at least six taste groupings .	0	psychology
 Umami is our fifth taste .	0	psychology
 3642 . Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose .	1	psychology
 Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3645 . These receptors include Meissner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian corpuscles , Merkel ’s disks , and Ruffini corpuscles .	0	psychology
 Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .	1	psychology
 Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .	1	psychology
 3648 . Generally speaking , pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature .	0	psychology
 Pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain .	1	psychology
 In some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system .	0	psychology
 3651 . The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture .	1	psychology
 As [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( utricle , saccule , and the three semicircular canals ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear .	0	psychology
 3654 . One Gestalt principle is the figure - ground relationship .	0	psychology
 According to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground .	1	psychology
 3657 . Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity ( or good continuation ) and closure .	0	psychology
 The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 3660 . You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .	0	psychology
 Our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses : educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information .	1	psychology
 These hypotheses are informed by a number of factors , including our personalities , experiences , and expectations .	0	psychology
 3663 . Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with .	0	psychology
 Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment .	1	psychology
 They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .	0	psychology
 3666 . Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence .	0	psychology
 Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment .	1	psychology
 You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious .	0	psychology
 3669 . Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .	1	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3672 . Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response .	1	psychology
 Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs .	0	psychology
 3675 . Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet .	0	psychology
 Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning .	1	psychology
 This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus : the squeaky cabinet ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3678 . Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone .	0	psychology
 Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus .	1	psychology
 When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response .	0	psychology
 3681 . On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination .	1	psychology
 The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response .	0	psychology
 3687 . His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .	0	psychology
 According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .	1	psychology
 Essentially , if an organism does something that brings about a desired result , the organism is more likely to do it again .	0	psychology
 3690 . Remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior .	0	psychology
 In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .	1	psychology
 In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .	1	psychology
 3693 . ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments , Skinner often used an approach called shaping .	0	psychology
 Instead of rewarding only the target behavior , in shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior .	1	psychology
 Why is shaping needed ?	0	psychology
 3699 . With a variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are unpredictable .	1	psychology
 Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast - food restaurant .	0	psychology
 3702 . Although strict behaviorists such as Skinner and Watson refused to believe that cognition ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another behaviorist , Edward C. Tolman , had a different opinion .	0	psychology
 Tolman ’s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930 ; Tolman , Ritchie , & Kalish , 1946 ) .	0	psychology
 3705 . Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning , which are forms of associative learning .	0	psychology
 In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .	1	psychology
 The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .	1	psychology
 3708 . Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account .	0	psychology
 According to Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement .	0	psychology
 He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation .	0	psychology
 3711 . What are the implications of this study ?	0	psychology
 Bandura concluded that we watch and learn , and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects .	0	psychology
 Prosocial ( positive ) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior .	0	psychology
 3714 . The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts .	0	psychology
 Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .	1	psychology
 Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .	0	psychology
 3717 . An artificial concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics .	1	psychology
 Various properties of geometric shapes , like squares and triangles , serve as useful examples of artificial concepts .	0	psychology
 3723 . Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .	1	psychology
 Grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon ( Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 For instance , English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “ -ed ” at the end to indicate past tense .	0	psychology
 3726 . Semantics and syntax are part of a language ’s grammar .	0	psychology
 Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .	1	psychology
 Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .	1	psychology
 3729 . B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .	0	psychology
 Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .	0	psychology
 The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds .	0	psychology
 3732 . Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 For example , a well - known strategy is trial and error .	0	psychology
 The old adage , “ If at first you do n’t succeed , try , try again ” describes trial and error .	0	psychology
 3738 . The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias .	0	psychology
 An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .	1	psychology
 In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .	1	psychology
 3741 . Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .	1	psychology
 In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .	0	psychology
 Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .	1	psychology
 3744 . Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .	1	psychology
 In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others .	1	psychology
 3747 . According to the drive theory of motivation , deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs .	1	psychology
 These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to homeostasis .	0	psychology
 3750 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .	1	psychology
 Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .	0	psychology
 3753 . In the 1940s , Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components : crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence ( Cattell , 1963 ) .	0	psychology
 Crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it .	1	psychology
 When you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using crystallized intelligence .	0	psychology
 3756 . Practical intelligence , as proposed by Sternberg , is sometimes compared to “ street smarts . ” Being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences .	1	psychology
 This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ ; individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence ( Sternberg , 1988 ) .	0	psychology
 3759 . Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner , a Harvard psychologist and former student of Erik Erikson .	0	psychology
 Gardner ’s theory , which has been refined for more than 30 years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence .	0	psychology
 3762 . Creativity is the ability to generate , create , or discover new ideas , solutions , and possibilities .	1	psychology
 Very creative people often have intense knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at novel solutions , seek out the advice and help of other experts , and take risks .	0	psychology
 3765 . For most people , once they have eaten , they feel satiation , or fullness and satisfaction , and their eating behavior stops .	0	psychology
 Like the initiation of eating , satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms .	0	psychology
 3768 . Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play .	0	psychology
 A person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time , and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates .	1	psychology
 People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism .	0	psychology
 3771 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .	1	psychology
 People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .	1	psychology
 3774 . Prader - Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism .	1	psychology
 Typically , affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating .	0	psychology
 3777 . Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .	1	psychology
 Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .	0	psychology
 3780 . Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual ’s sexual orientation ( Jenkins , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 Sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and erotic attractions to same - sexed individuals ( homosexual ) , opposite - sexed individuals ( heterosexual ) , or both ( bisexual ) .	1	psychology
 3783 . Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .	1	psychology
 During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .	1	psychology
 3786 . In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .	0	psychology
 Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation .	1	psychology
 While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .	0	psychology
 3789 . When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender dysphoria .	0	psychology
 Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are .	1	psychology
 This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria .	0	psychology
 3792 . As a result , the test was normed and standardized , which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) .	0	psychology
 Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .	1	psychology
 Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .	1	psychology
 3795 . Without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population .	0	psychology
 A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population .	1	psychology
 If , for example , you measured the height of the women in your classroom only , you might not actually have a representative sample .	0	psychology
 3807 . The Schachter - Singer two - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience .	0	psychology
 According to this theory , emotions are composed of two factors : physiological and cognitive .	1	psychology
 3810 . THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONSEarlier , you learned about the limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) .	1	psychology
 The limbic system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , and the hippocampus .	0	psychology
 3813 . It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .	0	psychology
 The central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems’ activity ( Pessoa , 2010 ) .	0	psychology
 3816 . This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin ’s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .	0	psychology
 In fact , there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions .	0	psychology
 These include : happiness , surprise , sadness , fright , disgust , contempt , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( Ekman & Keltner , 1997 ) .	0	psychology
 3819 . Personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think , feel , and behave in specific ways .	1	psychology
 Our personality is what makes us unique individuals .	0	psychology
 3822 . According to Freud , unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood sexuality , are the forces that influence our personality .	0	psychology
 Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality .	1	psychology
 These theorists , referred to as neo - Freudians , generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality .	0	psychology
 3825 . The unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges , and is present from birth .	1	psychology
 It directs impulses for hunger , thirst , and sex .	0	psychology
 3828 . According to Freud , a person who has a strong ego , which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego , has a healthy personality .	0	psychology
 Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or unhealthy behaviors .	1	psychology
 For example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive .	0	psychology
 3834 . In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .	1	psychology
 Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .	0	psychology
 3837 . After passing through the oral stage , children enter what Freud termed the anal stage ( 1–3 years ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training .	1	psychology
 3840 . The final stage is the genital stage ( from puberty on ) .	0	psychology
 In this stage , there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface .	1	psychology
 3843 . He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .	1	psychology
 Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .	0	psychology
 An inferiority complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society .	1	psychology
 3846 . The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) . These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .	1	psychology
 3849 . Memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer .	0	psychology
 Memory is the set of processes used to encode , store , and retrieve information over different periods of time ( [ link]).Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system .	1	psychology
 Storage is the retention of the encoded information .	1	psychology
 3852 . It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information .	1	psychology
 This is known as effortful processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3855 . Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect .	0	psychology
 The self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance ( Rogers , Kuiper & Kirker , 1977 ) .	1	psychology
 Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter ?	0	psychology
 3858 . In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .	0	psychology
 These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .	0	psychology
 Their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called Atkinson - Shiffrin ( A - S ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information .	1	psychology
 3861 . Short - term memory ( STM ) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory .	1	psychology
 Short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long - term memory .	0	psychology
 3864 . Understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types .	0	psychology
 Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall .	1	psychology
 For example , if you are studying for your chemistry exam , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory .	0	psychology
 3867 . Declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced .	1	psychology
 Explicit ( declarative ) memory has two parts : semantic memory and episodic memory .	0	psychology
 3870 . Can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — meals , conversations , clothing choices , weather conditions , and so on ?	0	psychology
 Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions ; however , American actress Marilu Henner , best known for the television show Taxi , can remember .	0	psychology
 She has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 3873 . There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and relearning .	0	psychology
 Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval : it means you can access information without cues .	1	psychology
 For example , you would use recall for an essay test .	0	psychology
 3876 . Karl Lashley began exploring this problem , about 100 years ago , by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys .	0	psychology
 He was searching for evidence of the engram : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( Josselyn , 2010 ) .	1	psychology
 First , Lashley ( 1950 ) trained rats to find their way through a maze .	0	psychology
 3879 . Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) .	0	psychology
 They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats , and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks , such as object recognition and maze running .	0	psychology
 3882 . It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories , and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories ; this is called arousal theory ( Christianson , 1992 ) .	1	psychology
 For example , strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which strengthen memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event .	0	psychology
 3885 . Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning .	0	psychology
 He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .	0	psychology
 3888 . Bandura ( 1977 , 1995 ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - efficacy .	0	psychology
 Self - efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities , developed through our social experiences .	1	psychology
 Self - efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals .	0	psychology
 3891 . Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford , where he was a colleague of Albert Bandura .	0	psychology
 Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior , and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology .	0	psychology
 3894 . Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma .	1	psychology
 People with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past .	0	psychology
 3897 . In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes , the Innocence Project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions ( Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Yeshiva University , 2009 ) .	0	psychology
" "" >"	0	psychology
 3900 . Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome .	1	psychology
 This syndrome has received a lot of publicity , particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses — often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) .	0	psychology
 3903 . I know I read the book in high school , and I remember that one of the main characters is named Scout , and her father is an attorney , but I honestly do n’t remember anything else . ” Nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is surprised she ca n’t recall the plot .	0	psychology
 What is going on here is storage decay : unused information tends to fade with the passage of time . In 1885 , German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization .	1	psychology
 First , he memorized lists of nonsense syllables .	0	psychology
 3906 . Memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final distortion error .	0	psychology
 Schacter ( 2001 ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events .	0	psychology
 3909 . These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .	0	psychology
 Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .	1	psychology
 For example , this week you are studying about Freud ’s Psychoanalytic Theory .	0	psychology
 3912 . Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers .	0	psychology
 One of Rogers ’s main ideas about personality regards self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves .	1	psychology

 This raises the question of how the media , even general newscasts , can affect citizens .	0	government
 One of the ways is through framing : the creation of a narrative , or context , for a news story .	0	government
 The news often uses frames to place a story in a context so the reader understands its importance or relevance .	0	government
 6460 . This study supports the argument that shrinking sound bites are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it . Craig Fehrman , “ The Incredible Shrinking Sound Bite , ” Boston Globe , 2 January 2011 , http://www.boston.com / bostonglobe / ideas / articles/2011/01/02/the_incredible_shrinking_sound_bite/ .	0	government
 Candidates are given a few minutes to try to argue their side of an issue , but some say television focuses on the argument rather than on information .	0	government
 In 2004 , Jon Stewart of Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show began attacking the CNN program Crossfire for being theater , saying the hosts engaged in reactionary and partisan arguing rather than true debating.“Crossfire : Jon Stewart ’s America , ” CNN , 15 October 2004 , http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html .	0	government

 6469 . U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .	0	government
 Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .	1	government
 For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .	0	government
 6472 . After the election is over , supporters experience remorse when their least - favorite candidate wins instead .	0	government
 For example , in the 2000 election , Ralph Nader ran for president as the candidate of the Green Party .	0	government
 Nader , a longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice , attracted many votes from people who usually voted for Democratic candidates .	0	government
 6475 . Electoral rules are probably not the only reason the United States has a two - party system .	0	government
 We need only look at the number of parties in the British or Canadian systems , both of which are winner - take - all plurality systems like that in the United States , to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives .	0	government
 6478 . For example , people who describe themselves as evangelical Christians are an important Republican constituency ; they are also strongly opposed to abortion . Aaron Blake , “ The Ten Most Loyal Demographic Groups for Republicans and Democrats , ” The Washington Post , 8 April 2015 .	0	government
 Thus , even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the mother , the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases .

 As a result , many women view the Republican Party as unsympathetic to their interests and are more likely to support Democratic candidates . Aaron Blake , “ The Ten Most Loyal Demographic Groups for Republicans and Democrats . ” Similarly ( or simultaneously ) , groups that have felt that the party has served their causes in the past may decide to look elsewhere if they feel their needs are no longer being met .	0	government
 Either way , the party system will be upended as a result of a party realignment , or a shifting of party allegiances within the electorate ( [ link]).V.O .	0	government
 Key .	0	government
 6481 . That change began with the 1932 presidential campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .	0	government
 FDR determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new coalition based not on region or ethnicity , but on the suffering of those hurt the most during the Great Depression .	0	government
 6484 . At its most basic level , being a member of the party - in - the - electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party .	0	government
 These voters are often called party identifiers , since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party , and they may attend some party events or functions .	0	government
 Party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season .	0	government
 6487 . Second , the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office .	0	government
 These platforms are usually the result of a negotiation between the various coalitions within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election .	0	government
 6490 . This has been particularly true for the Democratic Party .	0	government
 In 1988 , the Democrats tapped Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to introduce their nominee Michael Dukakis at the convention .	0	government
 Clinton ’s speech was lampooned for its length and lack of focus , but it served to get his name in front of Democratic voters .	0	government
 6493 . If the issue is important enough to voters , as in the case of gun control or abortion rights , an office holder may feel his or her job will be in jeopardy if he or she too closely follows the party line , even if that means disagreeing with the executive .	0	government
 A good example occurred when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which desegregated public accommodations and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , was introduced in Congress .	0	government
 The bill was supported by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , both of whom were Democrats .	0	government
 6496 . The problem of majority versus minority politics is particularly acute under conditions of divided government .	0	government
 Divided government occurs when one or more houses of the legislature are controlled by the party in opposition to the executive .	1	government
 6499 . Recently , however , a new voice has emerged that has allied itself with the Republican Party .	0	government
 Born in part from an older third - party movement known as the Libertarian Party , the Tea Party is more hostile to government and views government intervention in all forms , and especially taxation and the regulation of business , as a threat to capitalism and democracy .	0	government
 It is less willing to tolerate interventions in the market place , even when they are designed to protect the markets themselves .	0	government
 6502 . Scholars agree that some degree of polarization is occurring in the United States , even if some contend it is only at the elite level .	0	government
 But they are less certain about exactly why , or how , polarization has become such a mainstay of American politics .	0	government
 6505 . The first advance came with the introduction of the “ one - person - one - vote ” principle by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 .	0	government
 Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .	0	government
 This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .	0	government
 6508 . Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles ( 1970–1972 and 1980–1982 ) .	0	government
 Map designers , no longer certain how to protect individual party members , changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by a comfortable margin .	0	government
 The basic rule of thumb was that designers sought to draw districts in which their preferred party had a 55 percent or better chance of winning a given district , regardless of which candidate the party nominated .	0	government
 6511 . That is where political parties come in .	0	government
 Essentially , political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies .	1	government
 They do this by gaining control over the government by winning elections .	0	government

 Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .	0	government

 6526 . At various points in the past 170 years , elites and voters have sought to create alternatives to the existing party system .	0	government
 Political parties that are formed as alternatives to the Republican and Democratic parties are known as third parties , or minor parties ( [ link ] ) .	1	government
 In 1892 , a third party known as the Populist Party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the domination of U.S. society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and rural communities .	0	government
 6529 . Wallace ’s campaign was a failure , largely because most people believed his policies , including national healthcare , were too much like those of communism , and this party also vanished .	0	government
 The other third party , the States’ Rights Democrats , also known as the Dixiecrats , were white , southern Democrats who split from the Democratic Party when Harry Truman , who favored civil rights for African Americans , became the party ’s nominee for president .	1	government
 The Dixiecrats opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation , extend voting rights , prohibit discrimination in employment , or otherwise promote social equality among races.“Platform of the States Rights Democratic Party , ” http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25851 ( March 12 , 2016 ) .	0	government

 6535 . Largely for this reason , there is no comprehensive list of all interest groups to tell us how many there are in the United States .	0	government
 Estimates of the number vary widely , suggesting that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government , there may be more than 200,000.Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .	0	government
 Following the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act in 1995 , we had a much better understanding of the number of interests registered in Washington , DC ; however , it was not until several years later that we had a complete count and categorization of the interests registered in each of the fifty states .

 6538 . Governments such as municipalities and executive departments such as the Department of Education register to lobby in an effort to maximize their share of budgets or increase their level of autonomy .	0	government
 These government institutions are represented by a legislative liaison , whose job is to present issues to decision - makers .	0	government
 For example , a state university usually employs a lobbyist , legislative liaison , or government affairs person to represent its interests before the legislature .	0	government

 On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .	0	government
 Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .	0	government
 6547 . The answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and realize they can receive the same grade as the rest of the group without contributing to the effort .	1	government
 This result is often termed the free rider problem , because some individuals can receive benefits ( get a free ride ) without helping to bear the cost .	1	government
 When National Public Radio ( NPR ) engages in a fund - raising effort to help maintain the station , many listeners will not contribute .	0	government

 Someone concerned about protecting individual rights might join a group like the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) because it supports the liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution , even the free expression of unpopular views.https://www.aclu.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 Members of the ACLU sometimes find the messages of those they defend ( including Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan ) deplorable , but they argue that the principle of protecting civil liberties is critical to U.S. democracy .	0	government
 6553 . More recently , several shooting deaths of unarmed young African American men have raised awareness of racial issues in the United States and potential problems in policing practices .	0	government
 In 2014 , Ferguson , Missouri , erupted in protests and riots following a decision not to indict Darren Wilson , a white police officer , in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown , who had allegedly been involved in a theft at a local convenience store and ended up in a dispute with the officer.“Hundreds of Ferguson Protesters March in Downtown D.C. , ” http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ferguson-Protests-Planned-for-DC-Baltimore-Tuesday-283807831.html ( March 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government

 6580 . Large states , like Virginia , felt it would be unfair to continue with this style of legislative institution .	0	government
 As a result , Virginia ’s delegates proposed a plan that called for bicameralism , or the division of legislators into two separate assemblies .	1	government
 In this proposed two - chamber Congress , states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber .	0	government
 6583 . The bicameral system established at the Constitutional Convention and still followed today requires the two houses to pass identical bills , or proposed items of legislation .	0	government
 This ensures that after all amending and modifying has occurred , the two houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they send to the president .	0	government
 6586 . Attempts at African American disenfranchisement continued until the civil rights struggle of the 1960s finally brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .	0	government
 The act cleared several final hurdles to voter registration and voting for African Americans .	0	government
 6589 . An enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the Constitution .	1	government
 An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .	1	government
 And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .	1	government
 6592 . These include Congress ’s sole power to introduce legislation , the Senate ’s final say on many presidential nominations and treaties signed by the president , and the House ’s ability to impeach or formally accuse the president or other federal officials of wrongdoing ( the first step in removing the person from office ; the second step , trial and removal , takes place in the U.S. Senate ) .	0	government
 Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch .	0	government
 The fact that Congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce .	0	government
 6595 . In the early days of the republic , Congress ’s role was rarely if ever disputed .	0	government
 However , with its decision in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court asserted its authority over judicial review and assumed the power to declare laws unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) .	1	government
 Yet , even after that decision , the Court was reluctant to use this power and did n’t do so for over half a century .	0	government
 Initially , the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature .	0	government
 6598 . His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .	0	government

 Another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of World War II , but then Congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades .	0	government
 That lull ended in the early 1970s when the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed .	0	government
 Among other things , it created the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it , limited individual contributions , and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns .	0	government

 These are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders .	0	government
 The minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position .	0	government
 As the official leader of the opposition , he or she technically holds the rank closest to that of the Speaker , makes strategy decisions , and attempts to keep order within the minority .	0	government
 6613 . Apart from this and very few other exceptions , the president of the Senate does not actually operate in the Senate .	0	government
 Instead , the Constitution allows for the Senate to choose a president pro tempore — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who presides over the Senate .	0	government
 Despite the title , the job is largely a formal and powerless role .	0	government
 6616 . However , joint committees have no bill - referral authority whatsoever — they are informational only .	0	government
 A conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the House and the Senate .	1	government
 The conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the House and Senate in different forms .	0	government

 This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy .	0	government
 6631 . Therefore , they ( and their staff members ) rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals , as well as about fellow lawmakers’ stands and constituents’ perceptions .	0	government

Many advances in women ’s rights have been the result of women ’s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government , especially since the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Women ’s Political Caucus ( NWPC ) in 1971 .	0	government
 The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .	0	government

 President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover - up of key information relating to the 1972 break - in at the Democratic Party ’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex .	0	government
 Nixon likely would have also been removed by the Senate , since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal .	0	government
 6664 . No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office , starting with George Washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers .	0	government
 For example , Washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties , consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch .	0	government
 Today , the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president ’s advisers.https://www.justice.gov/about ( May 1 , 2016 ) .	0	government
 And , in 1793 , when it became important for the United States to take a stand in the evolving European conflicts between France and other European powers , especially Great Britain , Washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat - in - chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived .	0	government
 6667 . Concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office , Jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted Congress ’s tacit approval of his actions .	0	government
 James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .	0	government
 Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .	0	government
 6670 . Of the many ways in which the chief executive ’s power grew over the first several decades , the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers .	0	government
 While Washington , Adams , and Jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars , it was President James K. Polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority .	0	government
 In 1846 , as the United States and Mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where Texas ’s southern border lay , Polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in Mexico .	0	government
 6673 . Later , however , as president himself , Lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the Confederate effort to seek independence for the Southern states .	0	government
 In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .	0	government
 He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .	0	government
 6676 . Over the course of the twentieth century , presidents expanded and elaborated upon these powers .	0	government
 The rather vague wording in Article II , which says that the “ executive power shall be vested ” in the president , has been subject to broad and sweeping interpretation in order to justify actions beyond those specifically enumerated in the document . U.S .	0	government

 6685 . Neither Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the Republicans or the Democrats ( respectively ) at the outset .	0	government
 The outsider phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated , however , in the 2016 presidential nominating process , as those distrusted by the party establishment , such as Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , who never before held political office , raced ahead of party favorites like Jeb Bush early in the primary process ( [ link]).Senator Ted Cruz ( R - TX ) , though disliked by the party establishment , was able to rise to the top in the Iowa caucuses in 2016 because of his ability to reach the conservative base of the party .	0	government
 Ultimately , Cruz bowed out of the race when Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination in Indiana in early May 2016 .	0	government
 6688 . Early presidential elections , conducted along the lines of the original process outlined in the Constitution , proved unsatisfactory .	0	government
 So long as George Washington was a candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion .	0	government
 But it took some manipulation of the votes of electors to ensure that the second - place winner ( and thus the vice president ) did not receive the same number of votes .	0	government
 6691 . In several elections , such as in 1876 and 1888 , a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has claimed the presidency , including cases when the losing candidate secured a majority of the popular vote .	0	government
 A recent case was the 2000 election , in which Democratic nominee Al Gore won the popular vote , while Republican nominee George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and hence the presidency .	0	government
 The 2016 election brought another such irregularity as Donald Trump comfortably won the Electoral College by narrowly winning the popular vote in several states , while Hillary Clinton collected nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide .	0	government
 6694 . In the immediate aftermath of the election , the incoming and outgoing administrations work together to help facilitate the transfer of power .	0	government
 While the General Services Administration oversees the logistics of the process , such as office assignments , information technology , and the assignment of keys , prudent candidates typically prepare for a possible victory by appointing members of a transition team during the lead - up to the general election .	0	government
 The success of the team ’s actions becomes apparent on inauguration day , when the transition of power takes place in what is often a seamless fashion , with people evacuating their offices ( and the White House ) for their successors .	0	government

 303 . There are five major chlorophylls : a , b , c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll .	0	biology
 Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion . With dozens of different forms , carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments .	0	biology
 The carotenoids found in fruit — such as the red of tomato ( lycopene ) , the yellow of corn seeds ( zeaxanthin ) , or the orange of an orange peel ( β - carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers .	0	biology
 306 . When studying a photosynthetic organism , scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra .	0	biology
 An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb .	1	biology
 Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption .	0	biology
 312 . It is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .	0	biology
 All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long - term storage in the form of a carbohydrate . PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , which also includes the cytochrome complex .	0	biology
 The cytochrome complex , an enzyme composed of two protein complexes , transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone ( Pq ) to the protein plastocyanin ( Pc ) , thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI .	1	biology
 315 . These reactions actually have several names associated with them .	0	biology
 Another term , the Calvin cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle .	0	biology
 Others call it the Calvin - Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery .	0	biology
 318 . There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells .	0	biology
 Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .	1	biology
" An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means "" between "" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means "" inside "" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands ."	0	biology
 321 . Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .	0	biology
 Ligands interact with proteins in target cells , which are cells that are affected by chemical signals ; these proteins are also called receptors .	1	biology
 Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties ; however , a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand .	0	biology
 324 . Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .	0	biology
 When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .	1	biology
 The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 327 . Autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released .	1	biology
 This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell ( the prefix auto- means self , a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself ) .	0	biology
 330 . Cell - surface receptors , also known as transmembrane receptors , are cell surface , membrane - anchored ( integral ) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules .	1	biology
 This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction , in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal .	1	biology
 333 . G - protein - linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G - protein .	1	biology
 The activated G - protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 336 . Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins .	0	biology
 In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .	1	biology
 A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .	1	biology
 339 . This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types .	0	biology
 Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways , in which signals from two or more different cell - surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell .	1	biology
 This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response .	0	biology
 342 . The response to the increase in Ca2 + varies , depending on the cell type involved .	0	biology
 For example , in the β - cells of the pancreas , Ca2 + signaling leads to the release of insulin , and in muscle cells , an increase in Ca2 + leads to muscle contractions . Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .	1	biology
 Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 345 . The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers .	0	biology
 348 . When a cell is damaged , superfluous , or potentially dangerous to an organism , a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death , or apoptosis .	1	biology
 Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell .	0	biology
 351 . Budding yeasts ( [ link ] ) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells ( cells with one - half the normal number of chromosomes ) combining to form a diploid cell ( a cell with two sets of each chromosome , which is what normal body cells contain ) .	1	biology
 In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate , budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor .	0	biology
 When mating factor binds to cell - surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby , they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP - binding proteins that are similar to G - proteins .	0	biology
 354 . The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle .	0	biology
 The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell ’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells .	1	biology
 The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated .	0	biology
 357 . Human body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .	0	biology
 A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .	1	biology
 The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .	0	biology
 360 . Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes .	1	biology
 Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .	0	biology
 Genes , the functional units of chromosomes , determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins .	1	biology
 363 . DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase .	0	biology
 After replication , the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids .	0	biology
 When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .	0	biology
 369 . Throughout interphase , nuclear DNA remains in a semi - condensed chromatin configuration .	0	biology
 In the S phase , DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules — sister chromatids — that are firmly attached to the centromeric region .	1	biology
 The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .	0	biology
 372 . In the G2 phase , the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation .	1	biology
 Some cell organelles are duplicated , and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase .	0	biology
 375 . During prophase , the “ first phase , ” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles , and the membranous organelles ( such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus , and endoplasmic reticulum ) , fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell .	1	biology
 The nucleolus disappears ( disperses ) .	0	biology
 378 . Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete .	0	biology
 Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules .	0	biology
 381 . During telophase , the “ distance phase , ” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense ( unravel ) , relaxing into a chromatin configuration .	1	biology
 The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell .	0	biology
 384 . During telophase , these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast ( a vesicular structure ) at the metaphase plate .	0	biology
 There , the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls ; this structure is called a cell plate .	1	biology
 As more vesicles fuse , the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell .	0	biology
 387 . The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .	1	biology
 Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .	1	biology
 393 . Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell .	1	biology
 This type of cell division is called binary ( prokaryotic ) fission . Binary Fission	0	biology
 396 . Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .	0	biology
 A septum is formed between the nucleoids , extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell .	0	biology
 When the new cell walls are in place , the daughter cells separate .	0	biology
 399 . Haploid cells , containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome , are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores .	0	biology
 Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell .	1	biology
 All animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm , or gametes .	0	biology
 405 . The synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .	1	biology
 The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .	1	biology
 In synapsis , the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other .	0	biology
 408 . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .	1	biology
 These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .	0	biology
 Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid , the double - stranded DNA is cleaved , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non - sister chromatids .	0	biology
 411 . When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another , the ploidy level — the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus — has been reduced from two to one .	1	biology
 For this reason , meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division .	0	biology
 There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis .	0	biology
 414 . Nearly all animals employ a diploid - dominant life - cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes .	1	biology
 Early in the development of the embryo , specialized diploid cells , called germ cells , are produced within the gonads , such as the testes and ovaries .	1	biology
 Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes .	0	biology
 417 . Supported by the monastery , he taught physics , botany , and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels .	0	biology
 In 1856 , he began a decade - long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants , ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system ( a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems ) .	1	biology
 In 1865 , Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society .	0	biology
 420 . Mendel was the first researcher to see it .	0	biology
 Instead of continuous characteristics , Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes ( specifically , violet versus white flowers ) ; this is referred to as discontinuous variation .	1	biology
 Mendel ’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring , nor were they absorbed , but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on .	0	biology
 423 . Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .	1	biology
 These offspring were called the F1 , or the first filial ( filial = offspring , daughter or son ) , generation .	0	biology
 Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .	0	biology
 426 . When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa , he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent , male or female , contributed which trait .	0	biology
 This is called a reciprocal cross — a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross .	1	biology
 For the other six characteristics Mendel examined , the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color .	0	biology
 429 . The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics .	0	biology
 The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone .	1	biology
 432 . Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics .	0	biology
 The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .	1	biology
 An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .	1	biology
 435 . Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .	0	biology
 When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross - fertilized , all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait , meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined .	0	biology
 438 . Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents , Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote .	1	biology
 Called the test cross , this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders .	0	biology
 In a test cross , the dominant - expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic .	0	biology
 441 . A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance , in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote .	1	biology
 An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans .	0	biology
 444 . The sex chromosomes are one pair of non - homologous chromosomes .	0	biology
 Until now , we have only considered inheritance patterns among non - sex chromosomes , or autosomes .	0	biology
 In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes , human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes , whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair .	1	biology
 447 . Because the gene is essential , these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization , die in utero , or die later in life , depending on what life stage requires this gene .	0	biology
 An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non - lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal . For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous , only wild - type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed .	1	biology
 The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1 .	0	biology
 450 . Observing that true - breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio , Mendel proposed the law of segregation .	0	biology
 This law states that paired unit factors ( genes ) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor .	1	biology
 453 . However , each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes , organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string .	0	biology
 The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage , in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair .	1	biology
 However , because of the process of recombination , or “ crossover , ” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently , or as if they are not linked .	0	biology
 456 . It is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes , known as synapsis , does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells .	1	biology
 When synapsed , homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination , or more simply , “ crossing over . ”	1	biology
 459 . Conversely , alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together .	0	biology
 The average number of crossovers between two alleles — that is , their recombination frequency — correlated with their genetic distance from each other , relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome .	1	biology
 Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above , the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05 .	0	biology
 462 . A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .	1	biology
 To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 465 . Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes , as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes .	0	biology
 They are caused by nondisjunction , which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis .	1	biology
 Misaligned or incomplete synapsis , or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration , can cause nondisjunction .	0	biology
 468 . An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets ( two for diploid species ) is called polyploid .	1	biology
 For instance , fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote .	0	biology
 471 . An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere , or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms , making these inversions easily identifiable .	0	biology
 474 . Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes .	1	biology
 Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose .	1	biology
 477 . Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds .	0	biology
 Single - strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single - stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix .	0	biology
 DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) .	0	biology
 480 . One strand , which is complementary to the 3 ' to 5 ' parental DNA strand , is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction .	1	biology
 This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .	0	biology
 The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .	0	biology
 483 . The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3 ' to 5 ' , and that of the leading strand 5 ' to 3 ' .	0	biology
 A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides .	0	biology
 The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .	1	biology
 486 . Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In proofreading , the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one , so a correction can be made .	0	biology
 The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand .	0	biology
 489 . Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA .	0	biology
 Mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to DNA .	1	biology
 Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .	0	biology
 492 . Mutations may have a wide range of effects .	0	biology
 Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .	1	biology
 Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .	1	biology
 495 . Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .	1	biology
 Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .	1	biology
 Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base , known as an insertion , or the removal of a base , also known as deletion .	1	biology
 498 . The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma ( [ link ] ) , which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs , which in turn specify the sequence of proteins .	1	biology
 The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs .	0	biology
 501 . This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid .	1	biology
 These nucleotide triplets are called codons .	0	biology
 The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 504 . The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid .	1	biology
 In addition , prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids , which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes .	1	biology
 Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .	0	biology
 507 . The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .	1	biology
 Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .	0	biology
 510 . coli , the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits , two of which are identical .	0	biology
 Four of these subunits , denoted α , α , β , and β ' comprise the polymerase core enzyme .	0	biology
 These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed , and they disassemble once transcription is complete .	0	biology
 513 . Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes , a few elements are conserved .	0	biology
 At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site , there are two promoter consensus sequences , or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The -10 consensus sequence , called the -10 region , is TATAAT .	1	biology
 516 . The mRNA folds back on itself , and the complementary C – G nucleotides bind together .	0	biology
 The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A – T nucleotides .	0	biology
 The complementary U – A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA .	0	biology
 519 . This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .	0	biology
 Further upstream of the TATA box , eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC - rich boxes ( GGCG ) or octamer boxes ( ATTTGCAT ) .	0	biology
 These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “ active ” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell .	0	biology
 522 . Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes , all synthesizing protein in the same direction : reading the mRNA from 5 ' to 3 ' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus .	0	biology
 The complete mRNA / poly - ribosome structure is called a polysome .	1	biology
 525 . When an in - frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation , a non - formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met - tRNAMet . In E. coli mRNA , a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon , called the Shine - Dalgarno sequence ( AGGAGG ) , interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome .	1	biology
 This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template .	0	biology
 528 . During and after translation , individual amino acids may be chemically modified , signal sequences may be appended , and the new protein “ folds ” into a distinct three - dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions .	0	biology
 A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment .	1	biology
 These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein ’s “ train ticket ” to its ultimate destination .	0	biology
 531 . Once elongation is complete , the pre - mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU - rich sequence , leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre - mRNA .	0	biology
 An enzyme called poly - A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues , called the poly - A tail .	1	biology
 This modification further protects the pre - mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm .	0	biology
 534 . Some of a ribosome ’s RNA molecules are purely structural , whereas others have catalytic or binding activities .	0	biology
 Mature tRNAs take on a three - dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The anticodon is a three - nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing .	1	biology
 537 . The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm .	0	biology
 Proteins that are needed for a specific function , or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway , are encoded together in blocks called operons .	1	biology
 For example , all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose ( or lac ) operon .	0	biology
 540 . coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes .	0	biology
 These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan ( trp ) operon ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If tryptophan is present in the environment , then E .	0	biology
 543 . When tryptophan is not present in the cell , the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator ; therefore , the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized .	0	biology
 Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off , the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators .	0	biology
 546 . The lac Operon : An Inducer OperonThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons , which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell .	1	biology
 The lac operon is a typical inducible operon .	0	biology
 549 . There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif .	0	biology
 When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .	1	biology
 The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .	1	biology
" 552 . Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it is given two protective "" caps "" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey ."	0	biology
 The 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) . The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .	1	biology
 555 . Proteins , called RNA - binding proteins , or RBPs , can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein - coding region .	0	biology
 These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions , or UTRs .	1	biology
 They are not introns ( those have been removed in the nucleus ) .	0	biology
 558 . The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre - miRNAs .	0	biology
 These pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .	0	biology
 Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .	0	biology
 561 . In translation , the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex .	1	biology
 The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .	1	biology
 The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .	0	biology
 564 . GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .	0	biology
 The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .	0	biology
 When bound , the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex , bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated .	0	biology
 567 . While these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in one cancer , changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals .	0	biology
 Therefore , changes in histone acetylation ( epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing ) , activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation , increased RNA stability , increased translational control , and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells .	1	biology
 Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell .	0	biology
 570 . Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired ( such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample ) .	0	biology
 Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .	1	biology
 Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .	0	biology
 573 . DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) .	1	biology
 The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand ( called cDNA ) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA .	0	biology
 576 . The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .	0	biology
 When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , the technique is called Southern blotting , and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , it is called northern blotting .	1	biology
 Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome , and northern blots are used to detect gene expression .	0	biology
 579 . Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .	1	biology
 An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) .	0	biology
 The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .	1	biology
 582 . They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .	0	biology
 Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins .	1	biology
 Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes .	0	biology
 585 . Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism ’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism ’s DNA to achieve desirable traits .	1	biology
 The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .	0	biology
 588 . The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting .	0	biology
 Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by introducing mutations in a gene , or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism .	1	biology
 591 . In nature , the disease - causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids , called the Ti plasmids ( tumor - inducing plasmids ) , that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants .	1	biology
 DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell ’s genome .	0	biology
 594 . The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .	0	biology
 A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome .	1	biology
 Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .	0	biology
 597 . The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis , a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment .	1	biology
 The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA .	0	biology
 600 . There are three methods used to create a physical map : cytogenetic mapping , radiation hybrid mapping , and sequence mapping .	0	biology
 Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .	0	biology
 911 . The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant .	1	biology
 A whorl of sepals ( collectively called the calyx ) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud .	1	biology
 Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs , although there are some exceptions .	0	biology
 917 . The ovary houses one or more ovules , each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization . The male reproductive organs , the stamens ( collectively called the androecium ) , surround the central carpel .	1	biology
 Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .	1	biology
 920 . The other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm , which is tissue that serves as a food reserve .	1	biology
 The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle , or small root , and one ( monocot ) or two ( dicot ) leaf - like organs called cotyledons .	1	biology
 This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms : the monocots and the eudicots .	0	biology
 923 . Monocots include grasses and lilies , and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group .	0	biology
 Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups .	1	biology
 They are categorized separately in many classification schemes .	0	biology
 926 . Explore this website for additional information on pollinators . More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma .	1	biology
 Consequently , plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators .	0	biology
 929 . Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action , from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species .	0	biology
 Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations , as opposed to the seeds used for large - scale agricultural production .	1	biology
 Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences , taken from a well - characterized portion of the genome , are used to identify a species through DNA analysis .	1	biology
 932 . The first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period , about 319 million years ago ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms , the first naked seed plants , which arose about 380 million years ago .	1	biology
 Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers ( cone bearers ) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues ; however , they still reproduced like ferns , releasing spores into the environment .	1	biology
 935 . Seed ferns ( [ link ] ) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures .	1	biology
 What makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovule — the female gametophyte and associated tissues — which develops into a seed upon fertilization .	1	biology
 Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous period .	0	biology
 941 . Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .	0	biology
 After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells , a 6–32-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed .	1	biology
 Next , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .	1	biology
 944 . Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .	1	biology
 These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types , organs , and organ systems during a process called organogenesis .	1	biology
 950 . Further subdivision of animals with three germ layers ( triploblasts ) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm , called a coelom , and those that do not .	1	biology
 This epithelial cell - lined coelomic cavity represents a space , usually filled with fluid , which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall .	0	biology
 953 . A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm , which is found between the two layers .	1	biology
 Although still functional , these are considered false coeloms , and those animals are called pseudocoelomates .	0	biology
 The phylum Nematoda ( roundworms ) is an example of a pseudocoelomate .	0	biology
 956 . The mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 The blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation .	1	biology
 In later stages , a second opening forms , and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 959 . The earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote .	0	biology
 Protostomes undergo spiral cleavage , meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated , and thus misaligned , with respect to the cells of the opposite pole .	1	biology
 This is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .	0	biology
 962 . A cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type .	0	biology
 In contrast , deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage , in which cells are not yet pre - determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types .	1	biology
 These cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells .	0	biology
 965 . Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .	1	biology
 Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .	1	biology
 Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae , and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore .	0	biology
 968 . The Cambrian Explosion of Animal LifeThe Cambrian period , occurring between approximately 542–488 million years ago , marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth ’s history .	1	biology
 It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time , often referred to as the Cambrian explosion ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Echinoderms , mollusks , worms , arthropods , and chordates arose during this period .	0	biology
 971 . The invertebrates , or invertebrata , are animals that do not contain bony structures , such as the cranium and vertebrae .	1	biology
 The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans , which include only the phylum Porifera : the sponges ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Parazoans ( “ beside animals ” ) do not display tissue - level organization , although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions .	1	biology
 974 . While sponges ( excluding the hexactinellids ) do not exhibit tissue - layer organization , they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions .	0	biology
 Pinacocytes , which are epithelial - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly - like substance called mesohyl .	1	biology
 Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen - like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions .	1	biology
 977 . In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .	1	biology
 In other sponges , ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge . Choanocytes ( “ collar cells ” ) are present at various locations , depending on the type of sponge , but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows ( the spongocoel in simple sponges , canals within the body wall in more complex sponges , and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges ) .	1	biology
 Whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge , choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl .	1	biology
 980 . An atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules .	0	biology
 Gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted .	1	biology
 In gemmules , an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen ( spongin ) that may be reinforced by spicules .	0	biology
 983 . Animals in this phylum display two distinct morphological body plans : polyp or “ stalk ” and medusa or “ bell ” ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 An example of the polyp form is Hydra spp .	0	biology
 986 . The cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .	1	biology
 The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .	0	biology
 989 . These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form .	0	biology
 The life cycle ( [ link ] ) of these animals can be described as polymorphic , because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle .	0	biology
 992 . Rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona .	0	biology
 The food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax ( pharynx with jaw - like structures ) .	1	biology
 Food then passes by digestive and salivary glands , and into the stomach , then onto the intestines .	0	biology
 995 . Eggs and sperm are released into the water , and fertilization occurs externally .	0	biology
 The zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .	0	biology
 In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .	0	biology
 998 . Mollusk species that are exclusively aquatic have gills for respiration , whereas some terrestrial species have lungs for respiration .	0	biology
 Additionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .	1	biology

 Captaculae serve to catch and manipulate prey .	0	biology
 1007 . The overall body can be divided into head , body , and pygidium ( or tail ) .	1	biology
 The clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus that aids in sperm transfer and gives rise to a cocoon within which fertilization occurs ; it appears as a fused band in the anterior third of the animal ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1010 . The name derives from the word ecdysis , which refers to the shedding , or molting , of the exoskeleton .	1	biology
 The phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies , which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size . Phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature .	1	biology
 The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word “ Nemos , ” which means “ thread ” and includes roundworms .	1	biology
 1013 . Crustaceans possess two pairs of antennae , mandibles as mouthparts , and biramous ( “ two branched ” ) appendages , which means that their legs are formed in two parts , as distinct from the uniramous ( “ one branched ” ) myriapods and hexapods ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 1016 . Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .	0	biology
 A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1019 . These animals do not possess antennae .	0	biology
 The second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps .	1	biology
 In some species , like sea spiders , an additional pair of appendages , called ovigers , is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps .	0	biology
 1022 . These buds , known as coelomic pouches , fuse to form the coelomic cavity , as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer .	0	biology
 The resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom .	0	biology
 The archenteron develops into the alimentary canal , and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula .	0	biology
 1025 . Podocytes , cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids , are present near the center of echinoderms .	1	biology

 1028 . The chordates are named for the notochord , which is a flexible , rod - shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species .	1	biology
 It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord , and provides skeletal support through the length of the body .	0	biology
 1031 . In tetrapods , the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils .	0	biology

 Tetrapods include amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals .	0	biology
 1034 . Members of Cephalochordata possess a notochord , dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail in the adult stage ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology

 1052 . Amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods .	1	biology
 Amphibia includes frogs , salamanders , and caecilians .	0	biology
 The term amphibian loosely translates from the Greek as “ dual life , ” which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders undergo and their mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle .	0	biology
 1055 . Amphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world .	0	biology
 Amphibians can be divided into three clades : Urodela ( “ tailed - ones ” ) , the salamanders ; Anura ( “ tail - less ones ” ) , the frogs ; and Apoda ( “ legless ones ” ) , the caecilians .	1	biology
 1058 . The life cycle of frogs , as other amphibians , consists of two distinct stages : the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage .	1	biology
 The larval stage of a frog , the tadpole , is often a filter - feeding herbivore .	1	biology
 Tadpoles usually have gills , a lateral line system , long - finned tails , and lack limbs .	0	biology
 1061 . The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg ’s external environment .	1	biology

 Several other characteristics are distinctive to mammals , including certain features of the jaw , skeleton , integument , and internal anatomy .	0	biology
 1079 . Sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates .	1	biology
 Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks .	1	biology
 Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns .	1	biology
 1082 . These allow side - to - side movement of the jaw , making chewing possible , which is unique to mammals .	0	biology
 Most mammals have heterodont teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth .	1	biology
 Most mammals are diphyodonts , meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime : deciduous or “ baby ” teeth , and permanent teeth .	1	biology
 1085 . There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .	0	biology
 The leathery - beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology

 Pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow , rather than filled with tissue ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 They contain air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs , and they have struts of bone to provide structural reinforcement .	0	biology
 1097 . During the Cretaceous period , a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Enantiornithes means “ opposite birds , ” which refers to the fact that certain bones of the feet are joined differently than the way the bones are joined in modern birds .	1	biology
 1100 . All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees , as they all descended from tree - dwellers .	0	biology
 This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation , or climbing and swinging through trees .	1	biology
 These adaptations include , but are not limited to : 1 ) a rotating shoulder joint , 2 ) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs , which are widely separated from fingers ( except humans ) , which allow for gripping branches , 3 ) stereoscopic vision , two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes , which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance .	1	biology
 1103 . Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa , the lemurs of Madagascar , and the lorises , pottos , and tarsiers of Southeast Asia .	1	biology
 Anthropoids include monkeys , apes , and humans .	1	biology
 In general , prosimians tend to be nocturnal ( in contrast to diurnal anthropoids ) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids .	0	biology
 1106 . New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini — a reference to their broad noses ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini — a reference to their narrow noses .	1	biology
 There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys .	0	biology
 1109 . The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids : the great apes ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately 6 million years ago .	0	biology
 1112 . Its brain size was 380–450 cubic centimeters , approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain .	0	biology
 It also had prognathic jaws , which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans .	0	biology
 In the mid-1970s , the fossil of an adult female A. afarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1115 . The shoot system generally grows above ground , where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis .	1	biology
 The root system , which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals , is usually underground .	1	biology
 [ link ] shows the organ systems of a typical plant .	0	biology
 1118 . Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .	1	biology
 In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .	1	biology
 1121 . Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .	1	biology
 Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .	1	biology
 This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base ; for example , it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing .	1	biology
 1124 . The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 In stems , the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle ; in roots , this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder . This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash ( Curcurbita maxima ) stem .	1	biology
 Each teardrop - shaped vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside .	0	biology
 1127 . The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .	1	biology
 An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .	1	biology
 The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .	1	biology
 1130 . Collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 They provide structural support , mainly to the stem and leaves .	0	biology
 1133 . The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .	1	biology
 Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .	1	biology
 Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis .	1	biology
 1136 . Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .	1	biology
 They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores . Openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor .	1	biology
 The ( a ) colorized scanning - electron micrograph shows a closed stoma of a dicot .	0	biology
 1139 . Phloem tissue is composed of sieve - tube cells , companion cells , phloem parenchyma , and phloem fibers .	1	biology
 A series of sieve - tube cells ( also called sieve - tube elements ) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube , which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids .	1	biology
 The sugars flow from one sieve - tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates , which are found at the end junctions between two cells .	0	biology
 1142 . Some plants , especially those that are woody , also increase in thickness during their life span .	0	biology
 The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth , and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem .	1	biology
 Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant , and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem .	1	biology
 1145 . The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .	0	biology
 In some plants , the periderm has many openings , known as lenticels , which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex , xylem and phloem .	0	biology
 1148 . Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter .	1	biology
 Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .	1	biology
 Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .	1	biology
 1151 . Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons , and contain many adventitious or unusual buds ( familiar to us as the “ eyes ” on potatoes ) .	1	biology
 A bulb , which functions as an underground storage unit , is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem , as seen in the iris .	1	biology
 1154 . Most roots are underground .	0	biology
 Some plants , however , also have adventitious roots , which emerge above the ground from the shoot .	1	biology
 1157 . When the plant embryo emerges from the seed , the radicle of the embryo forms the root system .	0	biology
 The tip of the root is protected by the root cap , a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure .	1	biology
 The root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil .	0	biology
 1160 . The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .	1	biology
 The endodermis is exclusive to roots , and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root ’s vascular system .	0	biology
 1163 . Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .	1	biology
 Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .	0	biology
 1166 . Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .	1	biology
 Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules .	1	biology
 Most leaves have a midrib , which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue .	1	biology
 1169 . In an opposite leaf arrangement , two leaves arise at the same point , with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch .	0	biology
 If there are three or more leaves connected at a node , the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled .	1	biology
 1172 . Each leaflet may have its own stalk , but is attached to the rachis .	0	biology
 A palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand , with leaflets radiating outwards from one point Examples include the leaves of poison ivy , the buckeye tree , or the familiar houseplant Schefflera sp .	1	biology
 ( common name “ umbrella plant ” ) .	0	biology
 1175 . Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water .	1	biology
 Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system , but are very interested in water movement between two systems .	0	biology
 1178 . Transpiration — the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata — is a passive process , meaning that metabolic energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement .	1	biology
 The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere .	0	biology
 1181 . Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources .	1	biology
 Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation .	0	biology
 The points of sugar delivery , such as roots , young shoots , and developing seeds , are called sinks .	1	biology
 1184 . It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space .	0	biology
 Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time .	1	biology
 Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight .	0	biology
 1187 . The phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore , similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole light - absorbing head group of chlorophyll .	1	biology
 Phytochromes have two photo - interconvertible forms : Pr and Pfr .	0	biology
 1190 . Gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight .	1	biology
 Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism , whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism .	1	biology
 1193 . Apical dominance — the inhibition of lateral bud formation — is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem .	1	biology
 Flowering , fruit setting and ripening , and inhibition of abscission ( leaf falling ) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins .	1	biology
 Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red / far - red responses .	0	biology
 1196 . The plant hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls .	1	biology
 However , more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process .	0	biology
 1199 . Oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections .	1	biology
 They act locally at the site of injury , and can also be transported to other tissues .	0	biology
 1202 . Cells in contact with a support surface contract , whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus . A thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus [ link ] .	1	biology
 In the Venus flytrap , two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork - like tines along the outer edges .	0	biology
 1205 . Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants .	0	biology
 An inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of , or produced by , a living organism .	0	biology
 Inorganic substances , which form the majority of the soil solution , are commonly called minerals : those required by plants include nitrogen ( N ) and potassium ( K ) for structure and regulation .	1	biology
 1208 . In addition to macronutrients , organisms require various elements in small amounts .	0	biology
 These micronutrients , or trace elements , are present in very small quantities .	0	biology
 They include boron ( B ) , chlorine ( Cl ) , manganese ( Mn ) , iron ( Fe ) , zinc ( Zn ) , copper ( Cu ) , molybdenum ( Mo ) , nickel ( Ni ) , silicon ( Si ) , and sodium ( Na ) .	0	biology
 1214 . Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .	1	biology
 Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand , silt , and humus ; these soils are called loams .	1	biology
 1217 . The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .	1	biology
 Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .	1	biology
 1220 . The soil profile has four distinct layers : 1 ) O horizon ; 2 ) A horizon ; 3 ) B horizon , or subsoil ; and 4 ) C horizon , or soil base ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter — humus — at its surface , with decomposed vegetation at its base .	1	biology
 Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention .	0	biology
 1226 . A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival .	0	biology
 Some parasitic plants have no leaves .	0	biology
 1229 . An epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants , but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition ( [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Epiphytes have two types of roots : clinging aerial roots , which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees ; and aerial roots , which absorb moisture from the atmosphere .	1	biology
 1232 . The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .	0	biology
 Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .	0	biology
 After reaching maturity , the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis , which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte .	0	biology
 1235 . The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .	0	biology
 The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .	1	biology
 The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma , style , and ovary .	1	biology
 1238 . Female Gametophyte ( The Embryo Sac)While the details may vary between species , the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases .	0	biology
 First , in the process of megasporogenesis , a single cell in the diploid megasporangium — an area of tissue in the ovules — undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores , only one of which survives .	1	biology
 During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac .	1	biology
 1241 . This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .	0	biology
 Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells , which later degenerate .	0	biology
 The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete , or egg cell , and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1244 . Male GametophyteA male cone has a central axis on which bracts , a type of modified leaf , are attached .	0	biology
 The bracts are known as microsporophylls ( [ link ] ) and are the sites where microspores will develop .	1	biology
 The microspores develop inside the microsporangium .	0	biology
 1247 . Pollination takes two forms : self - pollination and cross - pollination .	0	biology
 Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .	1	biology
 Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .	1	biology
 1250 . The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac , and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle .	0	biology
 Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .	1	biology
 Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 1253 . The terminal cell also divides , giving rise to a globular - shaped proembryo ( [ link]a ) .	0	biology
 In dicots ( eudicots ) , the developing embryo has a heart shape , due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons ( [ link]b ) .	1	biology
 In non - endospermic dicots , such as Capsella bursa , the endosperm develops initially , but is then digested , and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons .	1	biology
 1256 . The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo .	0	biology
 In endospermic dicots , the food reserves are stored in the endosperm .	0	biology
 During germination , the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves , much like in monocots ( monocots , by definition , also have endospermic seeds ) .	0	biology
 1259 . The embryonic axis consists of three parts : the plumule , the radicle , and the hypocotyl .	1	biology
 The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .	1	biology
 The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .	1	biology
 1262 . The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .	1	biology
 The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .	1	biology
 This shape is called the plumule hook , and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark .	0	biology
 1265 . Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity , or extremely low metabolic activity : a process known as dormancy , which may last for months , years or even centuries .	1	biology
 Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions .	0	biology
 1268 . Fruits may be classified as simple , aggregate , multiple , or accessory , depending on their origin ( [ link ] ) .	0	biology
 If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .	1	biology
 An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .	1	biology
 1271 . An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .	0	biology
 Accessory fruits ( sometimes called false fruits ) are not derived from the ovary , but from another part of the flower , such as the receptacle ( strawberry ) or the hypanthium ( apples and pears ) .	1	biology
 1274 . Either the ovule or part of the ovary , which is diploid in nature , gives rise to a new seed .	1	biology
 This method of reproduction is known as apomixis .	0	biology
 1277 . Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings , where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root .	1	biology
 In some species , stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water .	0	biology
 1280 . In another classification based on flowering frequency , monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime ; examples include bamboo and yucca .	1	biology
 During the vegetative period of their life cycle ( which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species ) , these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once - in - a - lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization .	0	biology
 1283 . They are asymmetrical , radial , or bilateral in form as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry ; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge .	1	biology
 Radial symmetry , as illustrated in [ link ] , describes when an animal has an up - and - down orientation : any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves , but not a definite right or left side .	1	biology
 1286 . No energy system is one hundred percent efficient , and an animal ’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat .	0	biology
 If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature , it is classified as a warm - blooded animal and called an endotherm .	1	biology
 The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .	0	biology
 1289 . Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor .	0	biology
 Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions .	1	biology
 Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .	0	biology
 1292 . A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes .	0	biology
 A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .	1	biology
 A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .	1	biology
 1295 . A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .	1	biology
 A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .	1	biology
 This is sometimes called a cross section , and , if the transverse cut is at an angle , it is called an oblique plane .	1	biology
 1298 . Epithelial TissuesEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells .	1	biology
 The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells .	0	biology
 1301 . Cuboidal epithelial cells , shown in [ link ] , are cube - shaped with a single , central nucleus .	1	biology
 They are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material .	0	biology
 1304 . Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system , primarily in the bladder and ureter .	1	biology
 These cells are arranged in a stratified layer , but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed , empty bladder , as illustrated in [ link ] .	0	biology
 1307 . Loose connective tissue , also called areolar connective tissue , has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue .	1	biology
 As illustrated in [ link ] , loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts ; macrophages are present as well .	0	biology
 1310 . Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .	1	biology
 The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .	1	biology
 Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .	1	biology
 1313 . A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .	1	biology
 The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .	1	biology
 Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .	1	biology
 1316 . The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point .	1	biology
 While there are normal fluctuations from the set point , the body ’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point .	0	biology
 1319 . Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level .	0	biology
 This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop .	0	biology
 1322 . Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant - based .	1	biology
 Examples of herbivores , as shown in [ link ] include vertebrates like deer , koalas , and some bird species , as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars .	0	biology
 1328 . Because most birds fly , their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low .	0	biology
 The stomach of birds has two chambers : the proventriculus , where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach , and the gizzard , where the food is stored , soaked , and mechanically ground .	1	biology
 The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated .	0	biology
 1331 . Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .	1	biology
 Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .	1	biology
 Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides .	0	biology
 1334 . The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .	0	biology
 The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach , as illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The peristalsis wave is unidirectional — it moves food from the mouth to the stomach , and reverse movement is not possible .	0	biology
 1337 . Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber .	0	biology
 Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen .	1	biology
 Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides ; it also helps activate more pepsinogen , starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin .	0	biology
 1340 . The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein , fats , and carbohydrates is completed .	1	biology
 The small intestine is a long tube - like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger - like projections called the villi .	1	biology
 The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli .	1	biology
 1346 . The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 The primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation .	0	biology
 1349 . The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices .	0	biology
 The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature ; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate , an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme .	1	biology
 1352 . The omega-3 alpha - linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids .	0	biology
 Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and , for this reason , are considered to be co - enzymes .	1	biology
 Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health , as outlined in [ link ] and [ link ] .	0	biology
 1355 . Digestion and AbsorptionDigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments .	1	biology
 It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium .	0	biology
 1358 . Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases ( those that break down peptides ) .	1	biology
 Specifically , carboxypeptidase , dipeptidase , and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids .	0	biology
 The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines .	0	biology
 1361 . The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach .	1	biology
 It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase .	0	biology
 1364 . One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment .	0	biology
 During the gastric phase , the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins .	0	biology
 Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .	0	biology
 1367 . In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .	1	biology
 Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .	0	biology
 Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices , it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum .	1	biology
 1370 . Neurons also contain unique structures , illustrated in [ link ] for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible .	0	biology
 Dendrites are tree - like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses .	1	biology
 Although some neurons do not have any dendrites , some types of neurons have multiple dendrites .	0	biology
 1373 . Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons .	0	biology
 Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction .	1	biology
 This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes .	0	biology
 1376 . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses .	0	biology
 Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .	1	biology
 Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .	1	biology
 1379 . One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .	0	biology
 This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .	0	biology
 Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .	1	biology
 1382 . Voltage - gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell .	0	biology
 The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential .	1	biology
 1385 . To accomplish this , the Na+ channels close and can not be opened .	0	biology
 This begins the neuron 's refractory period , in which it can not produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open .	0	biology
 At the same time , voltage - gated K+ channels open , allowing K+ to leave the cell .	0	biology
 1388 . This depolarization causes voltage - gated Ca2 + channels to open .	0	biology
 Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane - bound vesicles , called synaptic vesicles , containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane .	0	biology
 Synaptic vesicles are shown in [ link ] , which is an image from a scanning electron microscope .	0	biology
 1391 . This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .	0	biology
 Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .	1	biology
 For example , when the neurotransmitter GABA ( gamma - aminobutyric acid ) is released from a presynaptic neuron , it binds to and opens Cl- channels .	0	biology
 1394 . Long - term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long - term weakening of a synaptic connection .	1	biology
 One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors .	0	biology
 1397 . The dura mater also contains vein - like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart .	0	biology
 The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .	0	biology
 The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .	1	biology
 1400 . The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .	0	biology
 CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .	1	biology
 The brain floats in CSF , which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant .	0	biology
 1403 . The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain , over the eyes .	1	biology
 This lobe contains the olfactory bulb , which processes smells .	0	biology
 1406 . The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain .	1	biology
 It is primarily involved in vision — seeing , recognizing , and identifying the visual world .	0	biology
 1409 . Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) , shown in [ link]b , play important roles in movement control and posture .	1	biology
 Damage to the basal ganglia , as in Parkinson ’s disease , leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking .	0	biology
 1412 . The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion , as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation .	1	biology
 It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .	0	biology
 1415 . The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) , shown in [ link ] , sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem .	1	biology
 The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks .	0	biology
 1418 . The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system , which controls bodily functions without conscious control , and the sensory - somatic nervous system , which transmits sensory information from the skin , muscles , and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles .	1	biology
 1421 . The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .	1	biology
 Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs .	1	biology
 As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive .	0	biology
 1424 . Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body .	1	biology
 Each of the 31 spinal nerves ( in humans ) contains both sensory and motor axons .	0	biology
 1427 . Like Alzheimer ’s disease , Parkinson ’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease .	1	biology
 It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817 .	0	biology
 1430 . Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States .	0	biology
 Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination , inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations .	0	biology
 1433 . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration .	1	biology
 Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation .	1	biology
 Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .	0	biology
 1436 . The first step in sensation is reception , which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being bent or squished , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature .	1	biology
 The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .	0	biology
 1439 . How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?	0	biology
 In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in [ link ] ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure .	1	biology
 Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential .	0	biology
 1442 . A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions .	0	biology
 Merkel ’s disks ( shown in [ link ] ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates .	1	biology
 Merkel ’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips .	0	biology
 1445 . Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors .	0	biology
 It is not surprising , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli . Pacinian corpuscles ( seen in [ link ] ) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner ’s corpuscles ; they are found in the bone periosteum , joint capsules , pancreas and other viscera , breast , and genitals .	1	biology
 They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient ( but not prolonged ) pressure and high - frequency vibration .	0	biology
 1448 . Pain is the name given to nociception , which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage .	1	biology
 Pain is caused by true sources of injury , such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical .	0	biology
 1451 . In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .	1	biology
 1454 . The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .	1	biology
 The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .	0	biology
 The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup .	0	biology
 1457 . The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid ( perilymph ) inside the cochlea .	0	biology
 The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .	1	biology
 1460 . The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .	0	biology
 It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .	1	biology
 1463 . Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images .	1	biology
 Animals are bombarded with sensory information , and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic .	0	biology
 1466 . It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ( [ link]b ) .	0	biology
 The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .	1	biology
 The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .	1	biology
 1469 . Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .	0	biology
 Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short .	1	biology
 For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .	0	biology
 1472 . The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision .	1	biology
 The fovea has a high density of cones .	0	biology
 1475 . Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .	1	biology
 Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .	0	biology
 1478 . Taste , also called gustation , and smell , also called olfaction , are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors .	1	biology
 Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival .	0	biology
 1481 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .	1	biology
 The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .	1	biology
 Recall that sensory cells are neurons .	0	biology
 1484 . PheromonesA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species .	1	biology
 Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them , but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors .	0	biology
 1487 . Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin , unmyelinated axons .	1	biology
 The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli , and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor , so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant .	1	biology
 From glomeruli , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus .	0	biology
 1490 . The amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan , shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 If a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ -ine ” .	0	biology
 1493 . Additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity .	0	biology
 In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .	1	biology
 When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .	1	biology
 1496 . Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid - derived ( lipid - soluble ) and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells .	0	biology
 Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors .	1	biology
 Unlike steroid hormones , lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on DNA .	0	biology
 1499 . When a hormone binds to the receptor , the G - protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , in place of GDP .	0	biology
 After binding , GTP is hydrolysed by the G - protein into GDP and becomes inactive . The activated G - protein in turn activates a membrane - bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase .	0	biology
 Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP .	1	biology
 1502 . Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone .	1	biology
 A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands .	0	biology
 1505 . It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland .	0	biology
 The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .	0	biology
 1508 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .	1	biology
 This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .	1	biology
 A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another ; therefore , the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones : growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , melanin - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .	1	biology
 1511 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .	1	biology
 It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .	0	biology
 It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system .	0	biology
