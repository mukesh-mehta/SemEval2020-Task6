" 2951 . 3 times "" 10 "" rSup { size 8 { - 9 } } } { } m. The distance separating the two strands that make up the DNA structure is about 1 nm , while the distance separating the individual atoms within each base is about 0.3 nm . One might wonder why electrostatic forces do not play a larger role in biology than they do if we have so many charged molecules ."	"0"
" The reason is that the electrostatic force is “ diluted ” due to screening between molecules ."	"0"
" This is due to the presence of other charges in the cell ."	"0"
" 2963 . Van de Graaff generators ( or Van de Graaffs ) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity — they are also used for serious research ."	"1"
" The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 ( based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin ) for use in nuclear physics research ."	"0"
" 2969 . Large electrostatic precipitators are used industrially to remove over 99 % of the particles from stack gas emissions associated with the burning of coal and oil ."	"0"
" Home precipitators , often in conjunction with the home heating and air conditioning system , are very effective in removing polluting particles , irritants , and allergens ."	"0"
" 2996 . A few voltage sources are shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" All such devices create a potential difference and can supply current if connected to a resistance ."	"0"
" On the small scale , the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges , causing current ."	"0"
" 2999 . Kirchhoff ’s first rule ( the junction rule ) is an application of the conservation of charge to a junction ; it is illustrated in [ link ] ."	"1"
" Current is the flow of charge , and charge is conserved ; thus , whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out ."	"0"
" 3128 . Thinking of the molecules as many slits , analogous to those for the oscillating ropes , we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through ."	"0"
" The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an EM wave ( see [ link]).The slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light ."	"1"
" The bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the individual waves composing the ray ."	"1"
