# SemEval2020-Task6


This repository aims to solve ............

There are three subtasks

1. Task1
2. Task2
3. Task3

### Task1

There are .... samples for training and ..... samples for test. Which is spread across .... num of topics and have the distributions as follows.

##### Approach:
1. Training data is present in different text files which are processed to convert in '.csv' format.
2. Divided the data in 5 folds.
3. Torch-text and pytorch framework is used with custom preprocessing and tokenizer.
4. Experiments are done with pre-trained embeddings and Sequence classification network with dynamic length of sentence.

#### Model
##### Baseline
1. The Baseline model is a LSTM model with .... hidden units and .... layers with ........ embeddings.
2. Model was trained using ..... optimizer for ...... epochs with ...... batch size.

##### Results
Following is the classification report and confusion matrix.
